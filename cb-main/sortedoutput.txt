Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
Let me see what I can do.
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
You're sweet.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What's normal?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
Perm?
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom? Kat has a date?
No, but
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay! I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona Random skid.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
No fear.
Who cares?
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Oh, right. Friday.
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Seven-thirty?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
Why, don't you?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
You know what they say
What?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I saw you there.
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
Who?
BIANCA
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
What?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
I am busy inside.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
Then you are too ambitious.
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
What...? Do I have so many already?
Call them.
Look out of that window.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Damn God!
Colon! Don't!
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh? So you are a new man?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
God be with us admiral.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right. Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here. I have your money.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here. Shit...
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.
No. No way.
But it's...
What else do you need?
Your mother was blind?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Yes, but he was a cop.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Somewhere else?
So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
It was my decision, not his.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
I let her take a shower.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
No! Nothing happened.
Okay. But not water sports.
End my career?
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
It's okay.
Yeah.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
No. I'm okay.
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
No.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, what is it?
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good. Good. Commendable.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Something back home?
Raw deal.
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
Stop it.
I'm not.
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Answer the phone.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah. I promise.
Okay.
See you later. Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
I'm not moody.
Not what. Who.
Yeah. And he still went to the party.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
And what do you do with the bones?
Dog food.
No. Are you proposing?
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Let her go! Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Yes.
Please join us. Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest. This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Don't speak Russian!
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
We have no money. Come on.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Sit down!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Cut!
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
Shut up. Look!
Be quiet. Watch.
No, I don't get that!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Surprise! Surprise!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Ha. Ha.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
You want the tape? There it is!
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
In love? With who?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright. Go ahead.
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Thanks. Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
Evidence. Of a homicide.
No way! He's mine!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah? Guess again.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah? What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
But you knew that, right?
What??
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
You hear that question, Garcia?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
She's wonderful.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Really.
Yes.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Yes.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Thank you, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
How is gregor?
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I see.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Roger.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Yeah, dummy. Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
In the back. Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're done. End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
The bet's off.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
No way...
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it.
Yeah. Guess not.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
One of em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Nothing.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
What's wrong with that?
What'd you do?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Jack, are you okay?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack? What was that?
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't. We've had a hard night.
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
That's what I'm saying.
Yes..thank God..
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
Like shit.
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
Yes ma..
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
Does it get any better or what!
Got it...
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
OK, you can turn around!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
It's difficult.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
...Like love...
Exactly.
Because...
I love you...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I'm not at the hotel!
No... not at all. Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
We've been all through that. I've been on my best behavior.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
Sure. I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
I know.
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
Tom? Where have you been... ?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
It has to be this way for now. It won't be long.
I don't know. I'm sorry...
You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Amy...
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
I'm telling you...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
What can I do for you today?
Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
We can do that.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Machine's in?
He's in. It will be his pleasure.
Brooklyn. Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
It's good what you're doing.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
What the fuck are you.. ?
One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Because we're going there.
What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Show me.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
Where? Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
I'm asking.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right? Told you you would.
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
See you then. Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
A daughter.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's their Presidential Suite.
Great.
Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
Nope.
It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
Thank you.
He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
To the penny. Exactly one million dollars in cash.
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you? Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Neil... Neil Cole.
That's exactly what I am.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
I don't know.
September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Of course.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know. I think so.
Will you let me look?
Who is this... ?
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
No, sir, he is not.
He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance.
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Cash.
No, you may not.
Okay. Fine.
What?
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Never say can't. Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What?
Kristen...
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
I know. I hardly have any time to study.
We have matching luggage.
What?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
I know. Uh...Alice.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here. It feels like...
Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later. Come on!
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
Let me talk to you.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
Your distraught. It'll help...
Mother, you've just murdered me. Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God! He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
And ours. It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
How did you know that?
Been having bad dreams.
No...
My friend, with the funny hand.
Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
Jesus! Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
There you go. Love you.
Me too.
No. A deal's a deal.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
So did Dan.
I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
Greta, come on. One burger with me?
Well we gotta do something!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah. I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Nobody thinks that.
Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
That's their problem.
Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
No shit.
She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life. Oh, what's that?
My undying love. Have some.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
Who?
Makes you look like a nun--
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
How is he - ?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not - ?
Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
I don't know.
So they caught up with you, too?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
'Us?'
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen! Hear that?
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Right at our one-eyed friend!
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
What????
Radiation level...constantly rising...
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
Huh?
It'll be all right. We're old friends!
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
After torpedo room: Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
What?
Nothing we can do, now.
Minus three.
Come where?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not. Therefore -
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Thank you.
I'll be another!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Always has been.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
You don't believe me?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
No.
Same old shit.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
This spring.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
Mmm.
Wonderful!
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Shit.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
He sure as hell won't.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
I don't want to.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
No what?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
You can't.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
I'm not saying that.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
So?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Where's Jill?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack doesn't need money.
You knew me as a kid.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
Good.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
Nothing.
You no-good pup!
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
She's coming.
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Wade?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
We don't know that.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Thanks. Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Roger.
Ga get it.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
No.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Hold on, Alice.
You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
You better take this.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Not now, Elaine.
I mean until we start to burn up.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Set!
Now!
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
I mean for Ted.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
So mentally ill?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Roger.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine. I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive. Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
I don't want to hear that word!
What...?
I'm sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
Just poached on toast. Over.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Poached! Not over! Over!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door. The door's over there.
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
Yes. He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No. I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
He had fish, too.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
No.
Ted!
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Who wants to be first?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
You promise you'll write.
Every day.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
No. No thank you.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
A virgin. I find that very arousing...
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Yeah...
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she? Well, she was wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
Lay off, asshole.
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history... Eternity...
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
Do it!
Gesundheit. You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Through the chest. Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Nice signal, dickwad!
Great. Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?! Great, fine. You talk to the wife.
Did you learn anything?
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Screw me? That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back! I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.
This is mole. It's good.
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Yeah, that's it. Say it slow.
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.
When will Strader return?
My wife? She worries about me.
You are married?
Was. Divorced.
We mate for life. Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stop the car!
Nothing.
How potent?
We all did.
Where did he get it? Was there any of it on the ship?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
Ss-ai!
There! Go back. Down that side street.
Do what?! George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
You understand that. But how many others will?
You look very good.
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
For you, anything.
I'm sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Sure. Just a minute.
What's that?
That's all I know. You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah.
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You?
It is.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Yeah, that's comforting. Mine, too.
I got him. Don't get pinned.
I can't! Do you mind!
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up. Let's move. Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Let's go. Pull 'em out.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
How long until it blows?
What?
See you soon.
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
Well, thanks, I --
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Why not?
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
Dead on all channels.
It's insured.
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
The structure seems intact. They have power.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Gorman! Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So? So?
Shut up. Just shut up!
They're but off! Do something!
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
Forget it.
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
He's coming in. I feel safer already.
Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go.
Alive?
You tell me. I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Six meters. Five. What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
About seventeen days.
On my way.
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Yeah. I've noticed.
Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations.
Stand back.
All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
No. Have you?
Fuck you.
Anytime. Anywhere.
You're just reading me.
No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
Think of what? We're fucked.
Seal the door.
They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
Can't be. That's inside the room!
It's readin' right. Look!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?
No.. I've slept enough.
Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What about me?
Why not?
They're dead.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
I'm sorry, Newt.
You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
Wah...? Where are...?
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.
I know, honey. Me too.
Look!
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure. Go left.
Newt, wait!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
Right here, baby. Right here.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
Certainly!
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you didn't like it.
What?
Don't bother.
I'll be right back.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
What??
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Fartsbishop!
Why not?
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Of course.
Oh, leave me alone.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
No!
Yes!
I love you! I love you!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, damn!
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
What?
Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
No one.
I heard voices.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
Give me two more weeks. Please.
I can't write it!
Why not?
It's killing me.
Madame. How can I help you?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
And I'm asking you -
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Majesty.
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Your Highness.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Sire.
Well. There it is.
Of course not.
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Ah-ha.
I think so, Sire, yes.
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Enchanted, Madame.
Twenty-six.
Thank you, Sire!
What is it?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Ah, love again.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
This one will.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
I will, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Bene.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sssh! Stay here.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
So let me see it. Where is it?
Madame.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
But this is absurd!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Herr Sommer.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How much?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
I do.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
What man?
He knows. He knows!
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Of course.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
What time?
Common time.
Sing it back.
Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
I think so.
Show me.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes!
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Yes.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Baron!
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Italian?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Incredible.
The Emperor has given him permission.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
Did we?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Of course.
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
Yes, I should think so.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Sorry.
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
What?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Now I'm embarrassed.
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Good.
But, David.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex. Reassure me.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I'm freezing.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Pull over.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, stop!
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Will you shut up!?!!
David, let's go now.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
No.
Right.
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
I thought not.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, but we're about to.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
You could have told them!
I was having a nightmare.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Bambi?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Two weeks?
So they said.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Right.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I don't know.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
It's a five-pointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
What was it?
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Walk away, Jack.
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
Life mocks me even in death.
David!
What?!
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Will you be quiet?!
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
Thank you.
Hello.
How shall I do it?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
No.
No.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
You here again? What do you want?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
Why not?
Yes - sure
Yeah - sure!
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
He has?
Yeah.
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Yeah?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Aw, nerts!
Yeah.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
Take it easy, Clark.
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
Why, of course.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
All right, Jack, all right.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I haven't got it.
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
We can take blood from anything  If it's comin' to us.
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You don't have to do nothing.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Why, I needed a
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
See, we're getting along famously!
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't you know?
No.
I want to be near you!
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
What are you doing here?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Yes, now.
Oh, yeah?
I'm listening.
I guess I have said enough I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Thank you!
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Well . . .
Happy now?
No.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Directors, eh? Long faces?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Yes?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Sure, I think it's swell.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
There you are.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Why pick on him ?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Matt.
Yeah, swell.
Yeah.
Well, he was making love to her.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
All right, dear.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Mr. Williams . . .
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Yes.
Then where were you?
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
That was two hours ago.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
What have you done?
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
It's tougher than it looks.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Nope.
Then I love it.
... Will Perry ...
He just lost his temper a little.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Tomorrow.
Two.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Exactly.
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Tell me.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I recognize you.
How?
What's going on?
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
What is wrong with you?
She got two of them.
She was European!
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Let's ride.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
I got three.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
What will be?
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Sadie was not a man!
Shakespeare. He's European.
Ah.
Get buckets!
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course! Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
I had you covered. From back there.
Shit.
My little Web did that?
Died a hero.
Go home, Doc. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You're doing just fine.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Maybe, maybe...
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Heard of him.
Ma.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Bob's upset.
The posters?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
No, I --
Got any ideas, little brother?
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Yeah, Jimmy?
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Boys?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Little ones.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Hmm" what?
Stop it. This is just sad.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
But I like the presidential suite.
Pity.
Last February?
Mmm.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
No, I'll hang you. But I may miss you just a bit.
He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Right here in church?
Communion.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And the same age Web was. No.
No.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I guess so.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Really?
Don't talk about it much, though.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
By burning down their homes?
Move you fools!
Really!
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
THEN WHO DID?!
We did.
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It's going to be a long winter.
I demand action.
It's going to be a long spring.
No.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Vengeance.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
You never noticed.
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.
Do you take American Express?
I don't think so.
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
It's not that nice.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Nice.
I know her. I knew her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
Yes, naturally.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God...
What?
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
New card. What do you think?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
This.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
See you then.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You look nice today.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't. I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Dorsia is...fine.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Forget it.
What's that?
Sorry.
Jean? What?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Hello
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Next Saturday?
Yeah.
Uh huh?
She's from...France.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
Who?
Paul Owen.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Understandable. Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem.
Well...
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Not really.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see... That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
I'll be there.
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Suit yourself, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
I've been great. And you?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting. Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Nobody goes there anymore.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Another Martini, Paul?
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
You know what I mean.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I can paint anywhere.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
You saved my life in alot of ways.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
We're not gonna let it.
Milo! What about --?
I know, I know.
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
You can't just walk in, either.
...Whaddo I do?
So you believe me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Remember Lyle Barton?
I remember.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
...What?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're just afraid to eat it.
No.
That'll be a test, won't it?
I don't think he knows how.
Right... What's that mean again?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Have a seat.
I am. I am, sir.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
My goodness.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Yes sir.
'Forgot to introduce you. I have a girlfriend.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too. Let's do number five?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We tried!
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Oh. No thanks.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Okay. I'm Gary.
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Sure.
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You see what's hanging on the wall?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Maybe we should all get on it.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?
Just do it.
You do?
I mean, it's your life.
Those really weird, short lines.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
Let's get him in here.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Show me.
No. Please.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
Long story. Not that interesting.
She saved my life.
Why would you do a thing like --
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Hmm?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
What?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Thank God.
Oh.
That's lame, isn't it?
You'll come up with something.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
What?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Uh. Not exactly.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
Jesus, Teddy.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I didn't plan this.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Yeah, yeah.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
You're not listening.
Where is he?
We're too late. Take a look.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Groovy.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
To my health.
Kiss me.
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you. Let's go, baby!
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Yes Basil?
Be careful!
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Groovy!
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
Love is... love is... love is...
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
I beg your pardon?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Here, use mine.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Go! Just go!
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Of course, luv.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Who?
You know who.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Not now, Austin.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
Fair enough.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'll hurry back.
Likewise.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Are you crazy?
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Sure.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Where did you learn to shoot?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's its current position?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Silence!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
You shot me right in the arm! Why did--
Yes. Scott!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Not me.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
An evil petting zoo?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Yeah. What?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
Show me.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Why?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I love you, Vanessa.
Well, it's kind of weird.
We don't judge here.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Scott.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Really?
Seriously?
Red ...
... head ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
... death ...
... power ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Peter ...
Three days.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
Promised? Who promised?
There, look!
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Impossible?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
We have met ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
Looks like rain, Steed...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Ropes?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign.
Watch me.
We want to help...!
To you ... ?
A cover ... for us. I'm sorry...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Next assignment?
Thank you, Steed.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we: the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Choices?
I'll never marry you.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
And just what is the game?
Much better.
Mother?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Really? I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Do you really think so?
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I meant me.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Any other vices?
Small talk. Try the weather.
You should be dead. How do you feel?
Strange.
I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Very good, Steed ...
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Don't bother. Here's a bus ...
Is there anything that isn't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Orders.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Always. Except ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
You lied.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Hurry? What for? I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
Have we been invited?
It's called Black Leather.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Shall we?
Snuff. I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
But --
What kept you?
The plot. Hello, we must be going ...
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated. Wait here.
Peter's brother? But --
Half-brother to be precise.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Let me guess: Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Global warming?
So you say ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
She may try to kill you.
You.
Guilty until proven innocent?
Mother and Father know best.
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
She was ...
Both, actually.
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Stay by the window. By the window.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Ugh ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. What is it?
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Hey, man, congratulations!
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
When do the girls get to the party?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond... James Bond.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
What is this person's story here?
Ah, Cole. I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
The car for Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit!
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
She's mine!
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
Keep me informed.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
1002.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I can't sleep.
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
About what?
C'mere.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're...
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're really pissing me off.
Your mother's not dead.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Rick, you're lying!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
You're on.
Yeah.
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
A real turd.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
I think I screwed that one once.
Any time, Al.
Let's see your bread.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Screw you!
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
That's more like it.
Screw you...
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Screw that.
Yes.
I didn't know you were into that.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Milt?
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
That's it.
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Right.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
It's Bullwinkle.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
All right, who serves?
Can't I just maim it a little?
I'd love that.
Rick!
Oh, no!
No sob story is going to change my mind.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
It's all right... So have I.
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
This isn't right.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Right... Think it over.
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Be gentle.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Yeah...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
We're gonna be okay, man...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Stevie... I...
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
Not likely.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
Thanks for the speakers.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- Never mind.
Brian -- -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Yeah... too bright...
What, are you kidding? By myself?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
So hello.
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
How do you know?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
-- What were they doing there?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Shut up!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Yeah...
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Marty did. But I wanted you to come to.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
I wanted to be a good one.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Hi.
We still talking? Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
You're right.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
Sure you do.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Trychticholorate.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Pest control.
What are you listening to?
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't guess.
Are you going public with this?
Fire.
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Yeah.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
You look like... Brian.
Four months.
Four months?
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Nice boat.
It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Backdraft.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Well, let's have a look.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Cute.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Fixing my roof.
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
What's wrong?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
That's your job.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Who's this?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Absolutely.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn it all.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
I need to get in the trunk.
Alderman.
"Don?"
Don't you have any leads at all?
No Marty, I don't.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Yeah.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
You mean you could use it.
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you. Just give me back a little something for the road.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I know. Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Me?
I forgive you.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I want 15 on the Mets.
How about 7 1/2?
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
Don't bullshit me.
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
What case?
That 50 G could help you --
How 'bout...
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
Alright. Here we go. Let's go NIGGERS! LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Louder. They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Give me some?
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to?
Yeah, him.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What do I do?
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
You might be right.
Why are you smiling so?
Naw, not you. It can't be. That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
It's that bad, huh? It's all over my face.
She's also moorish.
Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan is all 'dat. I try her. I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff.
Naw, just jokin'. That's you. That's you.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Must be the pressure.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away. We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
Manray needs a job.
First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this.
Different.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
That can be done.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Did we get our bill yet?
And I'm the feet.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Well do something about it.
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
To what?
You're now Mantan.
You have to start getting into your character.
Mantan!!
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
No costume. No blackface.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Who are the other characters?
We think so.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's me, Peerless.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
How did you end up here?
The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
Not that often. He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
Your father is proud of you.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good. I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit? Walk away?
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph.
Break a leg.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny.
Everybody shut up.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
For what?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Light?
That's why it will be so much fun.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
Naw. I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous? Relaxed?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing. It will blow over by tomorrow.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me. That's some big shoes to fill.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
What you did is dead wrong.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
It looks delicious.
I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
I'll be right over.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I can't go all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
Soon.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Thank you very much. I always try my best.
The best defense is offense.
Thank you. And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that? You've never seen me.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home. Now we're getting countrified. We is Bama's.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
Oh her.
She hates dem.
Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big. The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
That'll work. I just bought one for myself.
I thought you got rid of...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
We can look out for ourselves.
For what? He left. Not me.
My people love me.
Y'know what?
What?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
That's ancient history. That has nothing to do with you and I.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good morning.
Where are you bound for?
That is none of your business.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen. My man is armed, and so am I.
I never was more in earnest.
O'Grady.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Your cousins go out with him.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens! Whatever? Has she died of grief?
I have heard of them.
Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir. Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear. It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant. Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What! You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death. To subscribe to all your commands.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Old fool!
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you. I want the best.
All right, five hundred guineas.
By name only.
Yes!
The Prince left him only that choice.
When is he to go?
What is to be done?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Yes?
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
I beg your pardon?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, if you've slept.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Who?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fine.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Can anybody hear me!
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
I don't know!
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you mean, alone?
We found him like this...
Shut up. West's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Of course --
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
You wanna bet?
Jesus!
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
He's telling the truth up to a point...
There were six of us...
Epilepsy.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.
Would you have believed me?
How do you know that?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Sir, yes, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Why?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him. Isn't that what we all wanted?
We just want to check your pack --
Why?
Do I?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Look in my pack.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
What don't you know?
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
Put it down!
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Well?
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.
Because I was standing next to him.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Who killed Pike?
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Not for me.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Does Osborne agree?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
The Senator...
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Get your hands away from the desk!
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You knew Sergeant West?
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Something like that.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Something like that. You?
I lost a bet.
The very same.
You're off to a late start.
So noted.
What point?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Got it.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
Watch me.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
What?
What happened next?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
They got their stories straight.
What?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Good idea.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
Yeah.
So did I.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Good, just making sure.
Get in.
Right back where we started.
Isn't this how your story goes?
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
Tough.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
Want company?
Yeah.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Poor fucker my ass...
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
So you took off your shirt?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
We've been making progress, I see.
Wait --
What.
Wrong answer --
Childs.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up. He was gonna cut him loose.
I used it to start the fire --
We're not going anywhere.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Bullshit --
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Then it's unofficial.
No --
It's too neat.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
That's great.
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
That would explain the indigestion.
Good luck, kid.
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Not yet.
It truly is.
Why?
I don't expect to.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
A pleasure.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No.
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Eighteen.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Go.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
No, I understand.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Stop.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Please?
Well, it's not a short one.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
You were talking about your wedding.
And I like you.
Karl.
Okay.
Beats me.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
I'm not scared.
Am I?
You learned from the best.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
True story.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
You mean, while I'm here.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
You know where the chemicals are?
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
Yes.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
Son?
Can we talk?
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river?
How what happens?
How I go.
Like this.
Okay. Okay.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
You say...
The River!
Story of my life.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I'm robbing this place.
'Fraid so.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Hello.
I wasn't expecting you.
Yes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
Did you?
They met at Auburn.
But it's romantic.
Mmm, what?
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Do you love him?
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
I need you on my side.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Is he going to be okay?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
We rented a car.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes. But that's a different...
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Do you know who that is?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
That's okay?
Yes. Thank you.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You know what for.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were good.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
We'll stop then.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
No I haven't.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Uh... Yes.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
What are you doing here?
I'm asking what you're here for.
What?
He says he feels safe here.
Oh. We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good.
And...
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic! Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I...
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Good night.
John.
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
Yes.
I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Yes I know.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
I don't want to know.
No I don't.
In the world.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What? No you're not..
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
But, you know, so what?
Excuse me?
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
I got what I paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand me.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Then okay. So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Thank Christ for that.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Well what have you got?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
Not really. Maybe a little.
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive?
Laugh it up.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
What's your name?
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Right.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Thanks.
How do you want to pay?
Cash.
Just wanted to see.
You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
You hurt it?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Not if no one finds out.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
You liked what I brung ya?
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
At church?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.
Okay.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You need a ride?
Now wait...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Stop what?
I got others.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Yeah.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
I don't love ya no more.
Let go...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Two days?
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
No ma'am.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
In my house, you watch that lip...
Or what?
Whose doin' is that?
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Uh-uh.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Well, get to it.
You drink whiskey?
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
I ain't in a hurry.
Anything.
I'm here with you.
The... chain helps.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You think God forgives people like that? You think God forgives people like me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon. You ready for this?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
I tried.
Nothin'.
By myself?
You can handle it.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Looks like you know a song.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Maybe I won't.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Nuh-uh.
Like I told you.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I told you to TURN BACK!
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
One thing at a time, Laz.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
This all looks wonderful.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
That's right.
But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
Rae...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Rae!
Hey.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star.
I'm a what?
Yeah, I do.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Got in a little accident.
Yeah.
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
Eh, if the bootie fits...
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor. And don't call me 'pappy.'
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Let go...
Get rid of it.
Why?
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
What?
The Wolf?
Maybe we should do something?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Saving your life.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
You didn't take, did you...? You hear things.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
Let's grab some food.
First decent idea you've had.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
That I should let you pay for the drinks. Kampai.
Cool?
You all right? You okay?
What does Charlie mean?
Hey, all right.
Yeah... I came to save you. If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
If you give me one.
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro. Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance.
I couldn't keep up. My shame is complete.
Yeah...
I'll get him for you, Nick.
I can see that.
I stole them.
He says they're very nice. He wants to know if you have anymore.
No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Nick...
There she is!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
Sure.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Four goddamn days. This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good. Very good...
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
I'll check it out.
You can trust me.
We're through. I mean it. This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
Shut-up.
I want to yank Kobo.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
What...? Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
Let's go. Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done. You don't have to come.
No.
Not now, man, okay, not now. Work with me.
I can't...
Kampai.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting. I like him waiting.
I followed them. An hour from the train station.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife. She left.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Luck.
Why's that?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Yes...
Call for help.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you.
I could use some help. Show me around. I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You have a helluva way of answering.
I don't think so.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Where's Ich?
Unavailable.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot. I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
The cheese...
No one's keeping him here.
Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich.
Maybe. If I come visit, we can find out.
I'd like that.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
Time, I've got plenty of.
I'm amused.
Don't be.
Then take it from him.
This by this...
Dope?
Not in that company.
Yeah.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.
What?
What...? What if I say no?
He was my partner.
Your plane's at nine a.m. Be on it. That's orders. Period.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Work with me. I want your best detective.
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Twenty-four hours, detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help. Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Goodbye, officer.
He'll be dealt with.
The families who control the casinos?
I'll pay you.
You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it.
I don't have to.
You want him dead too.
After a court convicts him. He belongs to me.
We were worried to death. It's awfully kind of you.
Well stocked.
If he won't cooperate?
Where?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Oh?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?
Death.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Come here.
I am?
Also extraordinary things.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Well, actually
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
Like...
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
You could help us.
Dr. Tyrell?
He could?
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
When do you deliver your project?
This afternoon.
Thank you.
Just thought I'd...
No, you stay here with us. Out last night together.
He's not ready yet.
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.
Okay, but don't kill him. Save a little for everybody. A masterpiece.
Industrial refuse.
Garbage man?
You didn't like her!?
Yeah.
This is Bryant. Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Who.
Got it.
Go.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Oh! Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
What about a summary then.
I think we're through for the night.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
The umbrella.
Never mind. Do they have that knowledge?
Longevity is classified. No.
It's okay. Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one. What'll you have?
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Ya.
Two months. But this one is not guy. It is girl. His girl.
Prosit.
No thanks.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Four years.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
Money?
No. I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering. That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
True.
Nope.
You're going to be over the limit.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Too old.
But if you could?
Me too.
Yes?
Can I come in?
Of course.
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing. She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
Lots of places. The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
What shows?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
I don't know nothing about it.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
For holes.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Come on.
Sorry.
Hey! Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
And who do I go to about you?
Of course not.
Why should I be?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I'd kill it.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
I work alone.
So?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Can you? I couldn't.
Right.
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
You didn't hear me. You were sleeping.
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah. Sometimes.
I wish I could.
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
I'm not sure. Is there a secret?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise. Just practice. Practice makes perfect.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid. Part of your education.
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Nope. Nobody could stand me that long.
Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
No, I don't.
What difference will it make?
Just wait here.
What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know where I been. I been on vacation.
Holden got hit.
Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you.
I'll see you in a minute.
Black?
Please.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Sitting next to you.
If she is, the machine works.
The machine works. She is.
Thirteen.
Five, maybe six.
Sorry.
Almost through.
Don't move.
Sorry.
What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I never seen a turtle.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Hi.
I don't have one.
Oh.
They left.
What about friends?
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We sure did.
I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
I was hoping you'd say that.
You scared me.
Just better.
Beautiful.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's your problem?
What's that?
My glands. They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Yes. I couldn't pass the test.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Really?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
Yes, ma'am.
I do fine, Adam. How 'bout yourself? You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Oh, brother...
Do ya?
It certainly is. I agree with you completely.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Are you French?
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
You don't?
Nope.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!! I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no! What?!
Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
It's Webber. Adam Webber.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay! Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Right.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me. Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Okay! Damn!
No.
Thank-Q!
Hey, no kidding? In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out? You and...men?
Why?! Who the hell knows?!
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey! Pipe tobacco! I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
What?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Night!
It's your life. And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem. We'll just sell another baseball card.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie. Just ask.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Two weeks.
Of course.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
What?!
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?
Yes!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
Wazoo! Try to listen. Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
That's boring!
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
I certainly do!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
Good-bye!
Not that one!
I like her.
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
No way.
Why?! I think she's very attractive.
Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Did you?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping! How attractive is that?! What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
No.
Yes, Eve?
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really? Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam. This is, uh....
...I do.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
What?
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do. I'll stay here and pray.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open. Will you be back?
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.
You're right! It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
No. Sit down.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir. Is that all?
Adult Bookstore. Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
You nut!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.
Really? Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife? Isn't that closer?
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
No.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
What?
Of what?
The hotel.
I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky? Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Really? No kidding?
Well, we're here to help!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Yes, ma'am.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist?!
What?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped. We're married.
No.
Yes.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
What about relatives?
All back East.
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light!
Good.
Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No. They all do.
I never know anymore.
Yes.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
No, Calvin. Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
Yes. Well... yes.
What?
Hi.
Coming!
You bet.
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
Sure.
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
No.
Yes.
I don't believe it!
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean! A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
I thought ten years.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff? Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Oh, my God...
Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn minute!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
Coward!
What?!
Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn!
Yeah! That's thinking.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
Yeah. Maybe he'll call.
Where?!
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Yeah.
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Not yet.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Never before this.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No way.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Yes.
No.
Lie down on the bed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright.
I'll go then.
No.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
See my breasts? See?
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
What?
No.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
Same here.
Frank? Can you stand up?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Falling.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong.
That's good.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
Yes.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Just get outta my bed.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
Why are you here? HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No. Not really. But also because I really want you to be alright.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
You look beautiful to me.
No. Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
Baby wants to fuck.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
What?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Nothing.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
What kinda beer do you like?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
Good, let's drink up.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Alright.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Maybe so.
Not really, why? You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know. He moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's go.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Frank!!!
No.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.
Okay.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
The Duke? What did you do?
Go find one.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
What did you do, Connor?
Aye.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Got it.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
What?
Chest pocket. Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
What happened?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What? What, that guy?
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
Well, I didn't but...
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Fuck!
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Aye.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
Shut it. It's Ma.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
He got beat up by a girl.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Italian.
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
A bit.
Me, too.
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, we're good man.
Yes, we are.
Yes.
Then what the fuck?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
Three.
No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Rocco!
Where's my cat?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
You... oh god, why?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
You killed my... my...
My, my...
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
Male or female, bitch?!!
Really want to know?
The fat man.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
The Sicilians.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Eight.
Shit! Shit!
No way they could have seen it.
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
What are you serious?
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
You sure you killed them?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, what'ya do?
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
What the fuck do you mean?
I mean he ain't here.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now. We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Y-Yes my son.
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.
Thank you, Father, thank you. Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
Have you no fear of God?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
He says. This is he.
This is he?
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
Just turn right here.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan! Stop!
You're right. You're right.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door. Check the aisles.
We got it. We got it.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What do you think?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
On your marks... Get set go.
Bob?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
True.
No. We didn't.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
What. What's the matter?
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
On the left.
No kidding.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Yes... It's true.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
That's not correct.
I know.
Where's the rest?
How much?
$383.
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Sure.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Right now.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Bob!
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Did that hurt?
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's going back down.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We're not sure.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
He stole a tractor.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Hold it.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going?
Move.
He looked too shaken-up.
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
No, I don't mind.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
It was stupid.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it. Did you drop it?
No.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Temporarily.
Dies y nueve.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Cuba.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
What do you mean?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
I don't know about that.
The one and only Little Richard.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
No.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
That's your domain.
OK.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
He electrocuted someone?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
I don't want to talk about it.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
He wouldn't move.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
Let's go.
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Let's go!
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Now!
I'm working on it.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think about.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
This is no good.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember? Don't worry about it.
Can't get it. It won't...
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You got that?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
She is a good looking woman.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
What?
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
There was a mistake.
What do you mean?
What?
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Excuse me.
I wasn't sleeping. You OK?
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Jesus...
Including Landy... She had access to the archives.
Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Okay...
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No, I do.
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Because you're afraid!
No. Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
He's dead.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I'm sorry.
How long? How long do I have --
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I should be better by now.
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
No. Not this. This is real. And he's right there...
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
Where are you going?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There's no choice.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It might have.
You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Yes.
Get on it.
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
I want to hear it from you.
I killed him???
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
What do you mean?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
Bourne?
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
What's that?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room. Check it out.
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
Here?
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Who's this?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Me? Four years.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Alright...
So?
Felt promising. It's a start.
Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we locked up?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
He was a modest man.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Impossible. How dare you bring a panicky lie.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Scotland. He intends --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
You fancy him.
Hamish, I... thank...
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
It's up to us, Hamish!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
I will not.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Let her speak.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You are. And I'll come again.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It's battle I want, not talk.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Peace is made is such ways.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
And I will consult with mine.
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Exactly.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
So what did you find.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I don't know. These things take time.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Cute, Evan.
Fix?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you protect me?
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Weirder than this?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.
I see a car.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
I thought you were a December baby.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
You'll see.
Go on. Sit down.
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
What?
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Which is?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Wow... read something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Gee, thanks friend.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Destroy it?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Meant no offense.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Sorry. Never heard of her.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Yes?
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
A champagne cocktail, please.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
Yes, sir.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
That's all right.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Well, so long.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
You needn't be concerned about me.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What are they?
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
Yes?
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I didn't count the days.
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
Oh, Rick!
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Does he always leave so early?
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Be careful.
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Yes?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
-- Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
I love you very much, my dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Not at all.
Any time.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Right.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Here it is.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
We'll be there.
Goodnight.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Good evening, Captain.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
How about New York?
Perhaps.
Mademoiselle.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Find one.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Huh!
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
A wise foreign policy.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Okay.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Thanks. I will.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Huh?
Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What friend?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
Our expenses?
Uh huh.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
There seems to be no secret about that.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
No.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Not right now.
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Just a little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Yes, boss.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
The failures they remember. It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying. Solution, fix rope.
Feels so good to lie here.
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
No water, no work.
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
No.
Wilson, do you believe this? Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are. You missed the shipping lanes.
Moon's too bright.
I'm putting it off.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen.
No!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Die tomorrow or die today.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly.
Shut up.
You are.
Look again, asshole. It's a mirage.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see?
Then we've just got shit.
Shut up. I don't feel like dying today.
There was an unavoidable delay.
No.
As much as anybody.
Want to come in? Get dry for a minute.
Okay. Sure.
Possible. So you did those wings?
Yeah. A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh? You've tried?
Well, I do a little drawing --
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No. that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
You? Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
Must be a story there.
I've got lots of time.
So do I.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Let's take a look.
Cold.
Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
And for you --
For when I travel?
A ring. I wanted a ring.
You did?
You can't go now.
I have to.
You want to.
We're a little emotional here. It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
I can't take him to work.
It's our dog. It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
Yes there is.
No, it was great. Maybe a little overkill --
I burned the Christmas tree.
Don't even start.
Malaysia. They're holding the sweep.
A week, max. Okay? Okay?
Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up. Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
I would have done the same thing.
Is that Jango?
My epitaph.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Not when you have no choice.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Great. Really.
I don't know. I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
I had to come. To be sure you were okay.
You too.
I'm so glad you're alive.
And how was your Christmas?
Terrific. Yours?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish. That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
I most definitely say I am.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
You bet I do. High tide comes right up to this road.
No.
Yeah.
So did I.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us?
Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Can you find her?
Who is this? Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here. We are very defused.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.
It was fifteen minutes late.
You fucked us over.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane. But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
I'm trying to help you here. There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent? Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
We're on.
Right. Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I'm most definitely not dead. And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
You beat 'em to shit, pal! Jesus!
This is Amber. Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Want to see my raft?
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Time I had lots of.
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
Hallelujah.
To life.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers. Wow. Terrific.
What?
That's what it's about.
Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it.
Deep, real deep.
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco. And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Life is waiting.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Dr. Homer Wells.
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm sorry, Homer.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I know.
I doubt it. She's just an...
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Two.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
Really?
I've never seen the ocean, either.
Burma!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Sure... I'll see you around.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Oh, sure!
You think? Maybe I was. I love this place!
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Right.
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want...
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
What do you want me to *do*?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Hi...
Yes, I *have*!
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I know what you've been doing.
He *loved* it! Didn't you?
*Homer* liked it! Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
Is that soon?
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
It's okay--I don't mind.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
It's all very normal.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Actually, I volunteered.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Obviously.
I don't know it.
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Of course.
I don't need your gratitude.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't know. Just promise me one thing.
Right.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
It's just my heart.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
No trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Almost.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
That's it.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
We see you next harvest.
It look nicer then home!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
What view?
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
What's lucky about that?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Isn't it always?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Guess so.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Mob?
Come on...
We're going to give him the money back?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Let's go, Jake?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jake, I mean, come on --
I told you, use less powder.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
And what about Big Al?
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We pay better.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
We'll use the Euc.
That's it.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Minus one.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
No. Just confidence.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em.
I think two million.
Stake you?
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Help me.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
We're not cops.
You interested in a little work?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Don't worry about it.
What?
And some new clothes.
Why?
I don't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
It's more than that.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO -- Deal with that?
Lily... Jesus Christ...
You know why I told you that, Jake? Because I trust you too.
What about what?
What about the money?
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
You better get over to Al's. Now.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm getting a ride.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Breasts.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Good point.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
Jake? Customs?
Do you have a ticket?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
What was it?
This is embarrassing.
I'll find the time.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Keep it up.
What?
Stand up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Then who's the Banker?
The King.
So what do you want?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
I try.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Let's just say he burned me once.
We're here.
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
High five.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
Goodnight.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
You're all scumbags.
A couple I know are getting married.
What's the Blue Book price?
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
How about five hundred.
What?!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
Did she? You were pretty thick at one time.
We all played the field.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
Habib?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care.
Looking forward!
South African women are very sporty.
Who was he?
She.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You mean I won't resist them.
You want me drunk?
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Turn around.
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
What job?
How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't know.
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby. This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Probably.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I'm on at nine.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Why not?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
You will?
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
You were talking in your sleep.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Gambling's not about money.
Really?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion! What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
What?
I want to buy a car.
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
No.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't. Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
Impossible to calculate.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
Near the casino.
In the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You don't like cheats, do you.
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I know that. But you can now.
I don't have any money. switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Robbery's not criminal?
I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
Wait a minute...
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
Yes.
Thank you.
It's all relative. I need the money too.
Do you?
Yes.
Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
No thank you.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Who...
Ross.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I might.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Have you got transport?
Thanks.
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
You've done pretty well.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I'm not going to report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't gamble.
Don't worry.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
It was you, you shit.
Jack.
I was at Beadles.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Give me 365.
We do.
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
You won't. Not without permission.
Five.
I make it six.
Five.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
I said good call.
Ever?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
How?
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Does he win?
He's a good customer.
I can see.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Bruised.
Right, that checks out here.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Yeah.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Talby, can you read me?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Arm yourself, bomb.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Armed.
Thanks.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
And I saw that I was alone.
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Right!
This is fun.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I'll check it.
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell is dead.
Fred.
Wha?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Yeah?
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No?
This.
Guess again.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
Who's Camille?
None of your business.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You know each other?
Leave. Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
No.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
She was there...
Could you give us a moment.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
You're roommates?
Police drone.
What? Where're we going?
No time.
No way.
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
Don't look down.
I didn't. It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so. Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story. Not interested.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
A grand.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Later.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Am I?
I got overhead...
Yeah, me too.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
You didn't...
Every week.
SHHH! Don't do that!
They took my daughter.
I know.
Can you help me get her back?
Look, I'd really like to...
What else can we do?
Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy.
Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky. I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now... It's okay.
Whoever that is.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Who is...
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Logan Cale.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Too early to tell.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Something.
Yeah...
I won't be staying.
I'm not a half bad cook.
You got a lotta nerve.
Me? You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Bent.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
We are not fine.
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention. But I had to see you.
You need to get out more.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
You lost me.
How well do you remember the lab?
Your basic hodge-podge.
Hardly...
You said you could help.
Your help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Somebody's got to.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Open it.
Deeds, not words. I need your help.
We're quoting Mom again.
With your help.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
Can't help you.
Any idea when she'll be back?
None.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Then what? That's it. That's all I got.
Nothing on Hannah?
Here's your money.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
You and me both.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me. I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
What guys do. 'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I'll bet you can. Sit.
Not right now? Okay, when?
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
I have sincere eyes.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You get it when I get her.
You're the best, Maxie.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
What if he's on the level?
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
What's up?
Max--
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes. The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
--a philandering pig.
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
No, I'm serious. That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Say the words, "I understand."
Shut-up...
I was on call.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's sick.
For a change.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Gin.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Right, slow...
Oh, screw it!
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Bye.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What? That's disgusting!
You got in the car, didn't you?
Yeah.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
One more time in English.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Weird...
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Damn straight we are.
Sunday, but...
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
DUDES!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Oh, yeah...?
Sure.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
They're what?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Check.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later.
Go ahead, Jam.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
What?!
I said, I'm sorry!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Yeah.
A bustier?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
What?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
We won?!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
It's not nearly enough, punk.
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Neither do I!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah.
Yeah, you did!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
Donnie.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
A metal craft of any kind.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I'm telling Mom.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Donnie! Give it back!
I didn't say shit.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You know what? I think that you did it.
What did you say?
Our saviour...
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
How much longer is this gonna last?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Hey...
School's cancelled.
Sure.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
What makes you think I'm not?
Why is that?
We never would have had this conversation.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
I'm going home.
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Why?
I don't want to talk about it. So what happened to your neck?
And what?
Well...
You want to kiss me...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
What?
Are you okay?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Maybe she's asleep.
Infant Memory Generators.
The whole movie. Let's go.
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen. Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
No. Frank.
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
That is a terrible nickname.
Do you get to meet Ed?
It feels wonderful.
Know what?
Where it came from?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Grandma Death.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
I know, Dad.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Where are you going?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
Frank.
I think he saved my life.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
No. That's stupid.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
What about your family, Donnie?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Yeah... you know... Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I... I was playing with fire.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
I think now that he might...
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Where is he, Donald?
Thank you.
Goodbye, Donald.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Guess who wrote it?
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't. She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
That's a nice name. OK, let me see it.
Congratulations.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He was a year ahead of us?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed.
Donnie? You're a dick.
That's enough.
You can suck a fuck.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
It is a big deal.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Yep.
How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty...
Go back to China, bitch!
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Raspberry.
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I stole four beers from my dad.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Yeah, you betcha...
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, never have kids.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Airport Ho-Jo!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh-you-beccha.
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
I love you much.
We was robbed.
It's okay.
We all do. Now let's go.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
I just did.
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Bitch!
Here, have some.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Yes, Leslie!
Hi.
NO... It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Then it must be Wednesday.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
So? Be real easy.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Anyone?
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
My dress'll reek.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Yeah.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Oh, all right How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Oh, my! Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Harold!
Close up shop!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything. He should be king!
Take a letter.
Who to?
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right... take out "President"... now read it.
"My dear"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
Take another letter... to my tailor.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
About - thirty-four seconds.
We'll start a fire -- -- and get rid of these microbes.
Take a letter...
None of your business... Take another letter.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
I wanna powder my nose...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
What's the matter with you?
All right -
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.
Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
'At's-a fine.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
She did.
What did you say to her?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more. I'm on the other side.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
Tired! I'd like to stretch this into a week -
$50?
Go ahead.
You don't understand. This is my niece Vera.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
Give me that again!
You worm!
Once more!
You upstart!
That's it! No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!!
THEN IT'S WAR!
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
That's it...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right. I'll fix you right up.
WHAT ?
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador! I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored... But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
For you, I would do anything...
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
I thought everything was working out fine.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
Oh?
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh, yes.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
No, I think a whiskey.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Well, these things take time.
Do you?
And here are my mother and father.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Oh Frederick.
Yes?
I found it.
Did you see it?
What is it?
Like this.
I'll get my bag.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
He fell. He falls.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die. Head's too heavy.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
I want him back!
Right... Right.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Indeed!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
No, more of an acquaintance.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
And what was that, John?
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Yes, I think I can.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Please do.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
What a mess.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
I don't know what I've got.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Yes.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
You've never been?
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Is he... dying then?
Yes.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
Won't be a moment.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Oh, yes.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
No, nothing.
Good morning.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
The hospital?
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Your mother?
Here.
Good morning.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
...Can you cure me?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh no, I couldn't.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Yes, very soon.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Fine.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir. What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
But, Father, it IS!
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down.
Yes.
But surely you know...?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never LOVED anybody!
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special...
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
Goodbye, Aud...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then let go!
The second note to wake the Gods...
Not quite...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
I will go and wake them up!
That I cannot tell you.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no... We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
REALLY?
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes?
You've got to let me go!
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
The important thing is not to panic.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Sh!
You don't love ME.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
I didn't mean to!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
What a stupid idea.
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Well... no...
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Odin!
I don't know! I just did!
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
What?
He was lucky... Sit there.
Come on, move it!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
No.
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
I know!
He wants to KILL us.
I know. I know.
Don't you FEEL it?
What's it all about?
What?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Well, you ARE!
Row! Row! Row!
Sorry.
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
ROW!
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
So?
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Well, come on!
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Oh... er... yes...
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right! Well... CHEERS everybody!
Right. Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
No, don't say anything else!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
But...
How about making friends?
What are you talking about?
I will join my grandfather there.
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
What d'you expect me to do?
Please.
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Well, where is he then?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Same thing, isn't it?
No, it is NOT.
Your lord.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Bastard.
That's it!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
Oh...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You could charge him what you like.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Well... I... I thought...
How can we stops him now?
YOU do it!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Relax!
I'm drowning! Help!
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Helpless...
Easy, Dad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
I hate you! I hate you!
You liar!
Neither am I.
Me too.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Sweetie, we called the company.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.
Say hi to Naomi.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I remember.
I told you that later.
No one.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
You did? You liked me?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
You were not.
I was not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
In the room?
In the world.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Okay, I guess.
Why?
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Well, I didn't want to assume.
It's okay, really.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Yes?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're sure? It's cold.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
It's okay.
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that. Anyway. See Ya.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
I'm fine.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?
No. I --
I know a man who needs a refill.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Yeah? Oh, great!
You should stay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Okay.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Okay.
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Where are you going?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I don't want to talk about this here.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Would you get me another, Joely?
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joel, you're a liar.
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
No.
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
I'm right here.
What?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
And I didn't have an argument.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
I'm Joel.
I know.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I love her.
Me too. There's this poem --
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think, before.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, maybe.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Oh.
Female.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
I think we should go.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
I love you.
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What if?
Joel, come here. Please.
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
A bully? Moi?
Doesn't sound like me.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I probably got the same thing as you.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Hi.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
That's your look for me.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Any messages, Carmen?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Well... I did.
What? What do you mean?
You take it. I don't know.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Go back to sleep.
In a minute.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I'm glad you called.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
We'll speak soon.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Nah, I don't know.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
'kay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
I better do this, Stan.
You found us okay?
Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's a good one all right.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
Go.
Yeah.
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
Where?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
I don't know! I just said that!
Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Shit!
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
You better go.
Hell no.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Welcome, Howard.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Well, thank you, Mary.
How do you mean?
Alexander Pope?
You are such a sweetheart.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
She came to help, Howard.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Oh dear.
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Jesus.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Then check the connections.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Just wanted to let you know.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Patrick, we need to focus.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
You mean she's dead?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
You don't?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
About...
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Like what?
Well.... er...
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What guy?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Why? Why do you have to go?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
But Countess...
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
I heard it.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Justin?
I think I found something...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
On my way.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
What about the accumulator...?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Roger that.
What?
Coffee.
No, thank you.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Hurry.
Run!
Trauma.
We'll make it.
It gets worse.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What happened?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...
Oh God...
Nothing. It's nothing.
A power drain --
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
What's on your mind?
Some things you don't get over.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
The dark inside me.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
From the Other Place...
Starck!
I built it.
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
I'm going in.
Start the countdown.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Justin. I won't let you die.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
Alive?
Frozen.
...how's the client?
Crystallized.
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Justin.
That's what we're here to find out.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
That is not acceptable --
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
It's complicated...
If it worked, yes.
The date.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
I don't know.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You can't, your orders are specific...
It's done.
Watch me.
Son of a bitch!
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
You're lying...!
NOOO!
What is that?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
One-four degrees...
Yes, sir.
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Love to.
Starck, give me a read.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We have a situation here...
We don't have time to fart.
They're gone.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Understood.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Come again, Skipper?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Let's go.
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
But you can breathe it.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
What is it, Starck?
I've got a theory.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I know that.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
He's dead...
Yes.
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ! It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Do you know what it was?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It's cold.
I don't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
1000 meters...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Ship's log.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I'm sorry.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I mean...
Is it safe?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him. It's them. I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
Should?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe you should date him.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way, wide load coming through.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
What about you?
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
Now.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Girl...?!
Dude. That's my sister.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
And if he's not...?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Showtime.
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation... How's the other matter?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
And that's a good thing?
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Never better.
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You always had a way with words. I should be getting back.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
We need to get past them.
What...? Oh.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You were?
I gave him twenty.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
You need a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Not at all.
Hilarious.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Arnold. What's happening?
Of course.
How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
Totally.
It's the first door on your left.
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
There it is!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Manager!!
Sis.
Hey-yo.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
I'll explain everything later.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
See you later.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good.
But they weren't mine.
Okay, Dennis.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
You're fired.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, really?
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know what I look like.
Well...
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Come on...
So are you. Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
You first.
How about both of us at the same time?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
No.
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
Really?
Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
Really.
Chicken!
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I don't go at all.
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
I like sex.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
My brother is gonna shit.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Do you think that guy's cute?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
Should we buy a frame for that?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Believe it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
I know.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Sixteen.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I think they're both virgins.
No.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
What?
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
I want romance.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Really?
That's the name they gave me.
Yes.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I don't know. I guess so.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
How about your phone number?
No problem.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
Yes.
We keep them.
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Oh... yes.
Sure thing.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Excellent.
Oh yeah.
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Naw. I don't mind.
Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Do you really have to go?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Awake? What do you mean?
Not for me.
Righto!
Well, thank you.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
Not where we operate.
Naked.
Dobermans don't talk.
What?
A major!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Really?
Las Vegas.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Damn right!
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
What for?
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
What limes?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Whatever's right.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Jesus.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Plans?
Lucy.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
Me?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Extract of pineal!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
No! I swear I'm not!
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Part of what?
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
You and a lot of other people.
Spare me.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They can't get in here! You said it yourself, they'll get in!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Right.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
With what just happened upstairs --
Gonna stay for a couple?
Anyone.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
Where's that?
Upstairs.
Come on, come on.
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
OPEN THE DOOR!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
You gotta be with me on this.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the head?
Hey!
Easy.
Follow me.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Shit!
Just move!
Fuck you too.
Get in line!
No. You?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
What?
Look.
Just an observation.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Oh yeah?
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
What?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Magic potion. You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Okay then.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
Huh?
He shot you the other time.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
What's going on between you two?
Nothing.
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Keys.
Get outta here.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in. Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
You keep that key handy.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
If he doesn't shut up...
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
I'm sure.
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
HELLLPPP!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Nothing, just lookin'.
She's not very nice, is she?
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
That's fine.
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
Oh...
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Deal.
I'd love to.
I think --
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I said I'm not lying.
I just hit it like you said.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Excuse me, sir?
Who's this?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
Very fine bone structure.
You see: We've got to change that name.
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
You know what I mean.
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
What?
Thank you.
Huh.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
Oh.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
An actress.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
GET OUT!
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Who?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Without me.
Showdown.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I gotta go now.
All square, Doc.
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
...Don't you?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Thank you, Harry.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Thank you.
No.
Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.
See you next weekend, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
...Then go.
Be careful, Francie.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
Always. Always.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Good.
See you next weekend?
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
But, Kurt, I...
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Fifteen.
Address?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you an actor?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
They'll mend.
What about your husband?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
What is this?
Why, you... you little bastard!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Don't touch me.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Yeah, well --
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Harry.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
How'd I look?
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Quietly.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
Yeah.
What?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Came to get a tan.
Kaminski.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Eight stories.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I know.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I'll bet.
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
...Take advantage of me.
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You can't drink.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What a man!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
What's that?
Will you marry me?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, You're crazy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you... ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
That would be okay.
Just a little way.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Who're you?
I live here.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
'Golden Boy.'
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Your big speech?
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You got it.
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Mama, what's...
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Why are these all opened?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Go on...
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Not long.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Sure.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Oh bullshit.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
And what's that?
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says.
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Really? Any problems?
What?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Oh for Christ's...
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Huh?
Sedate her.
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
'Incurable.'
Yes.
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
What kindness?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
The music? Or the fire?
Why?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I am afraid.
You speak.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil? Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
There is something I want. A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
No. I draw the line.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
There, there... shhh...
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
And you look so lovely.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous... Fellow..."
It's been months. It's not like him.
Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
The world is a dizzying place.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
You will. What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
I will be here when you return.
Not as weak as I.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Victor. I love you,
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
I've no choice
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It is
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Now husband and wife.
Open this door for no-one!
It wouldn't dare.
This ice will break yet. How's our guest?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
Do me a favor then... ...keep them to yourself.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
It's a letter to my father.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
They'll hang him all the same.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I owe you that. Done.
Let it go.
Philosophical?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor, explain yourself.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
The strain was evident.
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Madness?
My name is Frankenstein...
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
No, no, they're all dead...
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Tomorrow is another day.
Right! Right!
I was careless.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I guess...
Good night, Brenda.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
You okay?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Artist.
I don't know.
Almost five.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
They're off now.
Okay.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Wet. I don't know.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
Oh, you...
Somebody'll see.
No, they won't...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Thanks.
A short somewhere.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Where's Ned?
I don't believe you...
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Dancer.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
That was the telephone.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Good call.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Ned!
Don't call him.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I call it my shower dream.
Lead the way!
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Whassamatta?
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Those things can be nasty.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Aw.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
I mean...
That's thirty percent.
For two lonely nights.
Sure.
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Have you ever been there before?
I said new, this is an '90.
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
I'm exhausted.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
I have no idea.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Jacob.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
On the dresser.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
That's not fuckin' that... this is fuckin' this. Go sit over there.
Good. Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Yes.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
Forever together.
In other words, no.
Yep.
Kate, Scott?
That happens, you'll get it back.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
No!
Everybody goes home!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
You asked me if I would --
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Okay.
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
Anytime.
Not many.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only. You, get out!
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Gotcha!
One... Two... Three.
He didn't recognize shit.
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
I'm gonna go get the money.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
What?
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What?
No, I didn't.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Or what?
This ain't the time.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
We are... "South of the border down Mexico way."
We are?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
It don't look together.
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. He's a preacher.
Thank you, ensign.
No problem, lieutenant.
Just some of the women.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
Who's... Lieuten --
Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane." See what you can find.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
What'd you find, Kathy?
Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
"Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Oh, really.
Pardon?
No, sir, WHAT?
The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Sir...
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
West?
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks. Lemme do it.
Hey. Ain't your call, man.
Fuck me.
I'll act surprised.
Did you hear?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from --
Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one? The only woman?
Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Sounds familiar.
It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Should probably ask him that.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
You'll think about my offer?
No, ma'am.
Do that.
'Snot me. It's him.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water. Go, GO!
... two... one... MARK!
Flea! O'Neil! Why is there a break in that line?
Sir?
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
Check your watch, Pyro. Seems fast.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil. Go regulation.
Gotta situation here. Where are you? Stuck in traffic?
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part. Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Just like you would be.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes. Especially at night.
Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think someone's gunning for you.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Jordan. You watch your ass.
Sure. I'll join the crowd.
No shortage of suspects.
The Chief? Or maybe even Turrentine? Your C.O.?
It's done with, Royce. Let it go.
What about him.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
Yeah. Me too.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Well, now I feel so much better.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again. Especially at your age.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Thanks, Wick.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Wick. They got your crew, too?
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit.
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me. You?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.
Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me...
That's okay. Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
First big night of liberty and no date? You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
Just askin'
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
You heard me. Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
McCool's that same rank. We're both j.g.'s.
"Dad."
Any brothers? Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry? What's your favorite food? We'll try to get it for you.
Should I be afraid?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
She led us right to you. That's no threat?
No. Yes. I mean, depends on --
That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
I think you're the liar.
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
No.
I'm so glad we agree.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Okay, O'Neil. So you've impressed all the others. Now try me.
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Shut up, sir. I'm concentrating.
Your new roommate.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
North?
MOVE!
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We are so fucked.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
So am I.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
This ain't even workin' wrong!
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm. Let's aim higher.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Go in there. Talk to her.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Nearly four years...
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
You must have quite some harem.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Most people don't.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I was wrong.
How do you know?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Who is he?
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Your old sweetheart?
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
I can't.
It's your choice.
What?
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
I don't think so.
Me too.
I'll try.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Have them sealed off.
And how should we do that, Sir?
They are with me!
You're fast.
That is our job.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
Right. The worm guy. Can someone get those people off the beach?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Follow me.
You're standing on it.
That's right.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Thanks.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Oh.
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Sure.
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
You were right.
Good idea.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just don't.
...Yes sir. Your quarters sir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Where's my bed?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze. Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Open.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
...Damn you! Damn you!
Leadership....
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
"Just!?"
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Like YOU know?
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
THIS much.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
... . Well you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I was staying in character. "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
I had the shot...
Yes. Good was done this .....
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
I played Richard III...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about!
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Shut up.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
The ships are gaining...
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Could they be the miners?
Nobody was WATCHING?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Down there.
What?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Yes you did.
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the upper levels.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's your name, son?
Brandon.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
Up.
What? Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
We're getting major structural damage.
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
It's fractured...
We need another one.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc PINK) -' C -
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... What does that mean?
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We're doing episode 31?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
Not a clue. You?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
You smiled at me.
One minute I'm - Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Let me think. I need time to think.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
I don't think that's a cloud...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
What the hell are you talking about?
Right.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Well forget it! I'm not going. This episode was badly written!
Mark 12.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
You are so full of shit
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I can't... It's on autopilot!...
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Closer? I can try.
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP h37C
I see them! I see them! RD STREET PASADENA 57
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really. I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Catch me later, okay?
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini. Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Wh... Where are we?
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
It's as far as it goes!
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Anything.
Okay, I'll do this... "Caw Caw!"
Tommy, we have these...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy. Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
We've got to get out of here. C'mon, hurry
Practice driving, Tommy.
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole, areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Find them.
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I wish she was beneath me.
Over three hundred miles.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it? Sam Adams never did.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
It is.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
The army can survive without me.
I? You all know my history.
While they're strung out?
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!?
Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun! You know that!
Well... I misunderstood, then.
A lot of years have gone by.
What? What are you talking about?
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William. I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No. I guess.
No, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms. My lord.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
The British! These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene. He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Marquis! Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
We better, Congress invented him.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
No one knows...
To hell with Arnold...
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Unofficially, General Greene.
What's the difference?
What can he do? The British have massive superiority.
George! So good to be back!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
They help me understand why we fight.
How can you say that?
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Chose another. Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
My God, what?
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else? From Virginia?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Some things must never change.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I want you to see our hospital.
I don't want to see your hospital.
We're leaving them?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner. Sir.
It is; we need you George.
Is that the truth? Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
But not more than your comfort.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Africa, of course.
Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Capture them? Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
It's stupid, of course.
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Well, we must be who we must be...
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
And dost thou live to ask it?
Voltaire, of course...
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
That? I hear a mob: unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
He was not black! He was... tan! Weathered!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Calm down, Bear...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
We'll get it later.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.
Harry, let me answer that.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
What about her?
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's... young.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
That's all.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Three.
She can't talk right now.
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Gimme an hour.
In the can. That the money?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
What?
Bear, you're not really gonna -
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Depends. Who's this?
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Ray. Look at me.
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Sovereign.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
That's what I'd do. Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Get him out've here.
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
For a movie?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
One of his best parts.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Just a thought.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi. You're fifty feet in the air!
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
You have it?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Ask your man here.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet. The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Good-looking, too. Like Karen.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Buddy?
Compass.
Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Here's another tip...
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
What if it was?
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
What're you doing here?
Rough day on the set?
...That's what we finally decided.
For any movie.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Right. See how your story ends.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
What do you get out of it?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
That's what the guy said.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Come on in.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Murray's dead.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Harry -
I'm going.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Hello, Martin.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
Thanks.
A passenger liner. Over.
Say again. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
Morning, skipper.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Why not.
What?
What?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger?
Yeah.
No.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Seen a lota movies.
Oh yeah.
A what?
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Why not?
What?
Get up.
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
It looks like it.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Right.
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What is it?
I think you better see this for yourself.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You smashed it!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I bet you did.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell yeah.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
It's my pen name.
Yeah. Thanks.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Nope.
Only way to be.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
What?
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
But, who -- ?
The same day she supposedly went down.
Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
If it was a ship she hit.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
I don't know, are we?
Not our mystery guest again.
No. Someone else. A girl. I'm not sure she was... real.
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
I don't know.
Just lucky I guess.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
We hit land.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Go.
Let the buyer beware.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Looks like it's adrift.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
How's that?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Sorry.
Yeah.
You're up late.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Ho, baby!
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Moving to Sweden.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Maybe.
Drink up then.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
Say what?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Shut up.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
A what?
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Or what?
Better late than never.
What's this?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
No, no. You got leak.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Fifteen, at the most.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
Yeah, I heard about that.
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
No, really I --
Dana! Hi! Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Hello...
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Uh-oh.
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
I...
What do you mean?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
It's not optional!
Jesus...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
No.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
I guess.
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
"Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Yeah, well --
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
Hey Josh.
Are you ready to go?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
How perfect.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
Good.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Why?
Just look at them!
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you sign up yet?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
Hey, look at this...
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You loser!
What does that even mean?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Oh, we totally have to.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
Why do I always have to do it?
You're better at it.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
I dunno...
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Bingo!
Come on, it's too late now...
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Oh yeah...
Not really...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Somewhere downtown.
What, is she black now?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
It's always closed...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Let's go hassle Josh.
"Hassle"?
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
Everybody's too stupid!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Wait...
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
You cunt!
He does that every single day.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Don't worry.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Go ahead...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
How repulsive!
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
When was this?
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I need to talk to you.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
It's fine.
So where's all your stuff?
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I dunno...
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid... So... we finally made it!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Nothing.
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Shhh!
Seymour does.
Who does?
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
It's kind of falling apart.
Where did you get those pants?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
That tape sucked, by the way!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Get a job!
Norman.
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.
Fine, and how are you?
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Hey, where are you going?
Later, "Dude".
What?
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Well why do I care about that?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
God, fuck you!
Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Sure, I guess.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
A dollar seventy-five.
Okay.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
Hey, I was only kidding!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Jesus!
Every guy has a type!
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Shh!
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
C'mon, Seymour, please?
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Are you okay?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Never...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
YAAA!
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
And you like them?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
What?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
So where would we go?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I dunno, I...
What do you want?
I-I-I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
No problem.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
I wish I could see him.
Yeah.
Call me sometime.
Talk to us about it...
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Right, exactly!
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
I have no idea - I just want to...
That slut!
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Yes?
Do you have a check for me?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious. Two are dead now in two nights.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
-careful, Abdullah-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
How; we don't know where they are?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What have they done besides kill Starling? How many have they killed?
In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
Then why do it?
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
-well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
We have hunted since childhood.
Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. Why not, indeed!
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
What?
So that's what a lion looks like.
Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion.
Possibly.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -"there."
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
That's what the books say...
You mean nobody died?
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
We need to talk.
All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard.
Somehow I guessed.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...
Have you ever failed?
Only in life...
It's all right. Stay ready. They know it's there.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
I got big.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
You think they'll come then? Why?
Good luck.
Why?
Because I think they're after you.
The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
This is more difficult-
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? It means "slaughter"...
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Once...
Underneath. Somewhere.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
I don't believe you had a mother.
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Not even close. What happened?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.
Hold your son high.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Everybody has a choice.
I'm not saying you did. In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
No. Not that I can recall.
Certainly.
Thank you.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a building superintendent.
You're also a human being, Frank.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Oscar! You poor kid!
I'll supervise.
Okay, let's take a look.
Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here.
Or we could do that.
Thank you. Poor baby. I think I should put him down now.
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything at my apartment?
Does she know anything about babies?
I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Why do you say things like that? You're so much better than you know.
Let me jingle you right now.
Don't worry. Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
So what? It's a free country. Thanks, Lib.
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Ghostbusters.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right. We should stay.
How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
My pleasure.
I know.
Then why have you come?
The Upper West Side.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
I await the word of Vigo.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them. Please!
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist. I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years? He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They love you, Lib. Keep it up.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
His nickname is "The Hammer."
And we're the ...
That's it. It's on the bottom.
Nine feet -- ten --
Do it! Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who? Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Dana! Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
I hate Jello.
Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out. Ready, Teddy?
We're almost there, Lib. Step on it.
She's new in town.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
Huh? What?
You finished here?
What? Yeah.
Are you all right? You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.
No, I just thought --
Well don't think!
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
And decent.
Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.
It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
Well, thanks a lot.
Nice going, honey. It was brand new.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
Uuuuuuugh!!
What's the matter, dear?
It is a star! That's great. You're very good.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No. They're just coming to me.
Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely. I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic!
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I am Zuul.
I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Barrett. Dana Barrett.
Some people like the attention. Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
No? What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks. What's in there?
What?
Nothing. Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I told you, I ...
I know. It happened by itself.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it. Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay, okay. But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay. Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing. You're good.
Can't you tell me now?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion. One of their gods.
I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
I want you inside me.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper. But I want Dana. Dana, speak to me ...
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Really! Is it gone?
Talk to my accountant.
He's a big one. You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Back off, man! I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
What is it?
Keep it anyway. I have another one at home.
Thank you.
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA? What's he want?
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Great! How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see. And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
In a storage facility.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The magic word is "please."
Why do you want to see it?
Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree!
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes. I don't like this.
Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one?
Two wavy lines?
Sorry. This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you? Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off!
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that. You might hurt someone.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
I'm always serious.
Wow!
Yeah, I can smell it.
What?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me. It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
All right, Peter. Good night.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Oh, shit!
Who?
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
No! Them! Shoot them! Cross the beams.
But it's my favorite state.
We'd better adjust our streams.
God, it's ugly!
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Neutronize. System shut.
The storage facility blew. This one ... ... shut off the protection grid.
Looked at with your eyes.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do we do now?
I don't know. Talk to it.
What do I say?
Anything! Just make contact.
To go into business for ourselves.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest! You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Maybe. But no one ever advertised before.
Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
Fourteen hundred.
It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor. Get down here,
Sit tight. I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild.
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
I don't know. I'm just guessing.
I can't take much more of this. The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Forget the trapping! Just blast him!
What? What popped in there?
Look!
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
No. But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Right. And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Right. We'll believe anything.
LATER, MAN!!
What do you mean "choose?" We don't understand.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon? And stay there?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I'm sure, I don't know.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I want that bastard dead!
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
That's difficult to say, general.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Gladly Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.
Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Caesar, I did my best. The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.
You don't know how wrong you are.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Narcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.
Only from a distance.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Why do you play at being drunk?
Yours will do!
But you do exist. Narcissus: hero of the battle of the Danube.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
They fear me.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear. And, of course, less dented.
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
On my honor as your daddy...
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Well, we can try...
What deal?
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
The battle is over. The war is over. You've won!
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do...
Chain him.
-- to fight? We'll see...
Then, you'll die... Just, know this: because you asked I asked: I'm sorry but...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
Don't be ridiculous.
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Was I?
Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
Yes.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No -- why should I?
I don't know.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
No.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes.
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I'm glad.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Okay.
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I do.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry.
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Oh.
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
What?
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Let me go.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
If you want.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Oh.
I don't know.
No.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't understand.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But Elaine --
Goodbye.
What?
Will you kiss me!
I don't know.
But you might.
I might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.
When?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Excuse me. Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Plastics.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
Because I don't like you.
Could I make one phone call first?
Get out!
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Well I'll hand it to you.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Right.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
What?
I'll be there in an hour.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
Sir?
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
That's right.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
No.
Let's go.
Right.
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What for?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Please.
What do you drink?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
No.
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I'm very neurotic.
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
My husband will be back quite late.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
Benjamin?
Yes?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Yes, I have --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
I've got to go.
Yes.
Thank you for taking me home.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Waiter!
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then. If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
Yes.
What?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Benjamin.
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
What?
A hanger.
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
Well?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Oh.
Don't you?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Go ahead then.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
I got up.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What?
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
There's no risk?
I walk out.
You walk right out the door.
He's asleep.
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Thank you.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
No.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Are you shocked?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.
Was he a law student at the time?
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Art?
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
There's nothing to tell.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
You're goddamn right I am.
Now don't start this.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Of course you did.
Of course I wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
But it's not.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Where is Elaine?
I'll find her.
I don't think so.
Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Nothing else.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Oh, no.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Meet someone?
Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
No wait. Wait.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Not if you don't want to.
I do.
But I don't want you to make up something.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
You don't?
Goodnight.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.
We haven't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Different.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
How long have we known each other now?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Great.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Yes.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
No, I don't.
Why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
I'd like to discuss this.
Dad -- can you listen --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are? Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Time's getting short.
Not now.
Yes, sir.
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Need any help?
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Why?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
Why?
I don't like your tone.
No --
With the pearls --
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
How?
I have an idea working in my head...
You might find a bullet through that head...
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation. You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Too bad.
Aren't you?
What?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Money.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Yes --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight.
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
Certainly.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And then --?
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
You are beautiful!
No.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
No?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's a silly joke.
Oh --
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
I --
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
Why later?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train. He leaves.
No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Why?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Don't.
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
Bless you --
Not at all, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron!
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- Well -- well --
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
Good!
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
As you will.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
No, doctor.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You are ill.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
But Doctor --
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
What, Doctor?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Everything?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
No -- I must find it -- Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
No.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- you would!
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
You dance splendidly.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Really?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- what -- what --
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
Do you like me better?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover --
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs.
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
Moreover...
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I got ten marks for that.
Me.
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing?
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Perhaps.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
...weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
No -- now.
Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
Yes.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
Well?
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
A thousand marks --
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
Well, he's a gentleman!
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're sweet.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Exactly.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Of course you took the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
What?
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
Yes --
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
Next week.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
What a session this has been.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
Oh!
Take them back, Suzette.
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
I wish to be alone.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Certainly, sir.
Again?
Please.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Me?
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
You are late. Hurry.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
Well -- gentlemen.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
Pretty as a picture.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You expect me to buy this?
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
What's that, Lilly?
You'll never shit right again.
You want a drink?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
I will. So long, Bobo.
Roy? He's always crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
I like you, too.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Fine.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn. It's his kidneys.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
We're not really interested, Henry.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
These machines -- They're in here.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You brought a case? Good.
What? He's going to be all right!
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
What is?
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
Lead on.
No?
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Only one tooth?
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
You always did.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
No. And you have to be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
You do?
No. That was the point.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
That's right.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
NO!
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
We'll work something out, Joe.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
I am in school.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Taking you for granite?
Are you sure?
Let's find out.
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here?
I want to know everything about you.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Oh, don't be stupid.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Working the what?
Oh, come on, Roy.
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Sure.
Open your door.
What? What for?
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
) What?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Thank you.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
What?
Not many.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Happy to see you looking so good.
It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
I like a woman who takes control.
That don't match either of the victim's.
No blood on the knife.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Girl scouts.
It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
The cemetery...
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Charming.
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Blake. How do you feel about Wisconsin?
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
Doesn't look good.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make?
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.
Oh. Sorry. I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit?!
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No. Wait for the police.
And miss the big game? No way.
You sure?
Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's missing?
Yeah. Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Forget it.
My life is a living hell.
To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I know.
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.
It's an option.
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
I was trying to get away from someone.
Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly? She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What? Where is she?
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
That would work.
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
I borrowed it.
Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.
I came to see you.
I can see that. Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy? You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Alright. I'll come out. Just be quiet.
I'm okay.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Who?!
Michael Meyers!
Looks great. It does.
You okay? You seem a little off.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Doesn't make it bad advice.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Bye Will.
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine. I just need to lie down...
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.
You're right. It does sound strange.
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
Never.
Yeah.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Oh, right. Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Can't you?
I did alright.
He gave me a fuckin' A? Wow.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You're unbelievable.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Very insightful.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Pig. What the hell happened this time?
Why? You interested?
No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there? Where's my mother?
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed. This is 1995.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
We can light our own tree at home.
Guess so ...
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
What if it's Kara?
The voice man! He's here!
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things. Bad things.
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
No one's coming to get you. Not while I'm around.
Promise?
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John. They were just kids.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
A man came by the house. A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
You knew, didn't you, John? You knew.
Who are you?
I've come to help your family.
Found this morning. In a field outside Haddonfield. Stabbed.
It's ... Michael ... ... Michael Myers!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
Here. Let me try.
Not just Kyle. All of you. His entire family. Here. Look at this.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
Retiring.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It's a sign. He's come home.
I'm here now, Jamie. You're going to live. You have to.
An old friend.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home. Checked it out myself.
Good. I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'll meet you over there.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Amazing, isn't it? I even taught him to drive.
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy. Take me.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here. You heard her, didn't you? It was Jamie.
Please -- just tell me the truth. Has Michael Myers come home?
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Only me -- -- and Dr. Wynn.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do. I would rather the women didn't.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
No.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Um.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.
Must have changed that law.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that. And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
You're lucky, boy. My house is gonna be filled with people.
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before. This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home! Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel. It's been beautiful.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
I guess. You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
You know me, boy.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
You told me.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh. I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me. I counted.
Really?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
It helped more than you know. Down deep, people were deeply affected.
He's a man. Tell him you're a man.
I dunno.
You're so low! Look at that beautiful red meat. You haven't touched it.
I dunno.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy. You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Me?
You.
Okay. Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so. It could have been.
If what?
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God-- And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Pass the fucking catsup.
You actually sold insurance!
Get used to it. Back door, Paul.
I've considered that.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
That can be arranged.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Things. Oh--you silly people and your things. Things, things, things.
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
For Africa.
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Out! Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Thank God!
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Dr. Woodly. I should make a little list.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency. I think it was birth.
Where's Mom?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I'll see.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
Ah! And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing. He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha! He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"Dad?" Dad. The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
The story gets hairier. Should I stop?
Go on.
Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days. It isn't there any more.
Sir?
He seems to think they are. He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Go ahead. No, no, no, no.
Sir?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Yes sir. If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Scat!
Damn.
Mom?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Who was it?
It's Mom.
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Of course it is. Is it loaded?
No.
Open the bolt!
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart! Load that gun!
Dad--
I don't want to fight you.
Yeah. But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter. How old are you?
Eighteen-- and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman. I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
The pelt is black. It's a kind of man.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Disease?
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead-- or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was. It never lasts long.
Thank God!
Have some.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Please--
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again. You used to eat it up.
I had a trip. We'll honeymoon here. Go out and play.
Buy yourself breakfast. There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
Ram it up your ass!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Which one?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise. Right now!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
No.
What then?
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yes.
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD Goodbye.
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse. He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Action! Interaction! Give and take! Challenge and response!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want. You become furious when people won't make you dead.
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
No.
Don't!
Stop!
Ah! The lady is armed.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is. Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Out!
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident. March! Move! You, too!
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You startled me.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be. We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Dead! Such a final word. Dead! Did you hear that?
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
She's fine. Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go? An emergency!
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the hall.
And her fianc!
I came back.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
She's crying because she's so happy.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You've been bitten by bats?
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root. Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Hundreds.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
You were wrong, you quack!
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer. Is that the same thing?
What brought you back?
What an hallucination! Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
Oooooo. That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
I'm high as a kite.
Glands. You're supposed to be happy when you die. Call me comical again.
You're a clown. You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I love you! Have a cigar!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical. Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
You hope.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No quarter asked. No quarter given.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open. Find out.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
And the hell with it. It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
You're too modest.
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You'd be killing a friend. Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.
No!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
If you want to be found that way.
What is this thing that kills me?
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
No.
Have it your way. We'd both be better off dead now.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
Thank you. You can leave now. We'll begin.
I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law. Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
I dunno.
What will you do, Colonel?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Yes.
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
You bet I'll worry about it. I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all. That's all. Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling. Why didn't you say so?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time. It drives me nuts!
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them. I'm bugging out of here.
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything. Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
I'll kill myself.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married! You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
Still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
Who have you been talking to?
What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly? You know who this is?
Shivers and sweats and groans. His teeth chatter. What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
He can hardly talk.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
Oh?
I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's fine!
Keeps fairies away!
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
No!
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Doing what?
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I know.
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I see.
Women are always late. You'll find out.
Beautiful! I've never seen that coat.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one. Shall we go?
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
For Harold. When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How nice.
What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see the cake?
How long has this been going on?
A week. We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale? You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Take plenty of cigars.
We made the date three months ago.
Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
It is?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
That's the XKE.
The what?
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Meaning?
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat. How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
Thanks.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Goodbye.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Is that a fact?
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
Which we do. But we can stop doing that.
Penelope! We're late!
It's good. Let him go.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
No.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You'll be fine.
Well, I want to...
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
What?
What do you mean?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers. Where's the guy who runs this place?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
How many weeks?
Just one.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back.
That's all you got, three girls?
Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Sam?
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so. What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go. Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I am.
Huh?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
You don't drink?
Ulcers.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah. I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
What rate?
You know what I'm talking about.
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was. He was with Ratan.
What does that mean? What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is Kristen safe?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
I can stop if you want.
No, please go on.
More or less.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Yeah. Well, mostly.
I thought I was fucked up.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Where does he live.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
On your own land?
But what?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
You are.
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
Who made it?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
Get out!
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Like what?
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
What?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
What is going on?
You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
Rucker.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
Ratan!
Let's go.
What?
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
What we got is just these here. What you see.
It's a short film.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman... ...right here.
I'm just trying to find... Who owns this store?
I don't know nothing, man.
No.
That's all right.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Not exactly...
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Oh.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Huh?
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You working in San Diego now?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
No.
Thanks.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
How long have you been driving?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Your tree.
All right, then, and we'll be off. Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Out!
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
Not very.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
You're welcome. Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Well then, I must be off. We shall have to meet again.
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
No. I thought not.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Oh.
Oh, look! The birds.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Well then.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
My door is always open.
All right.
Promise?
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Well...
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
But this is public property.
Exactly.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
What is that he's working on?
Yes.
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
No more revolts.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
But I don't play anything.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right. It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
What was that?
Okay.
I like you, Harold. Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Pray? No. I communicate.
With God?
With Life.
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they have.
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that. I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Maude.
Yes.
Here.
I took them out.
Why?
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
I'm getting married.
To whom?
To a girl. Here.
What?
A sunflower?
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
Can't complain.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. My uncle.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
And a lot of time.
What about the draft?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
What else do you like?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
No. I'd have liked to.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Thank you, Uncle.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
You think so, sir?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
ZAT!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Harold!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Yes.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
But wait...
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Time to play.
Julia.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, I do. I do.
Yes!
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
God, that's terrible.
What?
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Because I'm going to get my father!
Kyle, you don't have...
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
Finish what?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
You were ALL human!
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Oh, excuse me...
Yeah.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
The Cenobites.
See what??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Is he serious??
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
We don't take hints.
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Oh, right --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
See? I don't like that --
-- Hound of resurrection?
Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it -- ?
It doesn't say --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
In private, if you don't mind...
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
From where??!!
No. It's not.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I do. How many escapes? This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Who wards off demons.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Me?? C'mon --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Oh, stop that -- Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
You're doing fine.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Got tired of me?
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Manning says I'm too soft on you -- The candy. Give him the candy.
I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
We're on the move.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me? Her.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
His what??!!
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
Yup.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
My job.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back? Still angry?
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Yes?
Goodbye.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
Well good n-
Good night.
Alone?
How big can it be?
Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
Out? Out out?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
You're going alone?
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
Marco...
...Polo.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Strong.
A brute.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
What -- ?
That you feel that way about me.
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Sure.
It'll go in.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
No. That wasn't the deal.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
It's important.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
I don't remember.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Kirsty?
No.
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
You want it?
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured...
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I came for the wedding.
Oh. Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Ssh!
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
One more. Maybe two --
Keep your voice down.
You're hurting.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
No. I'm not.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
In here.
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
Let me see.
I'm going to throw up.
No, you're not.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Are you O.K.?
I'm here.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe...
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
O.K.
Kirsty.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
Only I'll turn it off --
No. I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please...
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
Oh?
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
That's right.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
Yeah, why don't I?
Maybe I will.
Am I?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I won't be a moment.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Try me.
Steve.
Daddy?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said: I found a room.
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Surprise.
Kirsty.
Sure.
I've forgotten.
Steve?
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
What?
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Sure.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Of course.
Finished?
He's gone.
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
So lie down.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I thought we'd lost you.
I'm coming! Sleep well.
It's late.
Not that late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right. No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?
We walk.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go. I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
It's a fetish of mine.
What happened to you?
What things?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I won't let anybody take you.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend.
That's right. Kevin. She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister. She lives in Australia.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Well what's the point in that?
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
But now I kind of like it.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
Suck my ass.
Terrific.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?
None. Christ!
You're not even coming?
Laura. Her dad died.
Ooh. Drag.
Haven't seen it.
Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh. Right. But I'd forgotten about that. I wasn't biting the idea.
Not really.
No way.
Yes way. It's really...
What?
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing? Okay, 20%.
No. We need the gig.
What do you think? Dick likes it.
No, you can't.
Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed...
Do not get ahead of yourself.
NO--!
It's the new --
No. The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well. Nevermind.
Nothing.
No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nothing. I just prefer the other one.
Bullshit.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
That's what I said.
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks! About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
Why?
Nobody.
Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
He's not worth it!
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh. That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five. So. Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
What's his name?
Good. Great. Yeah... Wow. Rob Gordon. Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Great. Gotta go. See you then.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay. Really.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Okay.
The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it?
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I want a tape.
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now!
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no. Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian. Let's get a drink.
Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...
Well stay for tonight, then.
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Are you coming home?
Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
My house?
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
But don't you remember?
I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it?
Not really.
I think you know that.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
No.
What, what?
No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
Rob. Don't be childish.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Fine. One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better? Better than what?
Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet.
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
It's me.
I figured it was. Where are you?
Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
You still together? Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Pigsty.
Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died. My dad, my dad.
No, no. When are you going home?
In a minute. When I get it together.
I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Yes, of course.
Uh... No.
Mmnn.
You're also an idiot.
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
C'mon.
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
It'll have to be sex, then.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
It was like sex. What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
To make you feel better.
Oh, great...
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
Hi. What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work.
Oh. Well. We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Just local, of course.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Barry? Barry knows about this?
Yeah. His band is playing a set.
I know. I don't get it.
Not really.
Right.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No. Probably not.
Right. Okay, then. Shall we go?
Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?
This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Hey. It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
You're kidding. A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Enough of what?
Good.
Yup. Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
The Conformist.
Exactly! Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Yes. You?
Oh, right. Alright.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Good.
That way. You?
That way.
And so it is. I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
Right.
Hi, Rob. It's your mother.
Everything all right?
Great. Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
So so. Up and down.
What do you mean? Where did she go?
How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen. What are you going to do Rob?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say? Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say. I'd like to hear her side of it.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
I must have nothing. Their my husband's.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Years. This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Fine.
Sure. Ten cents.
Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now?
Well we don't.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Fuck off.
I'm Vince.
Whatever.
What's the name of your label?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Find the father. That should clear things up.
Yeah.
He'd want to know about all this.
Sure.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Fine.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
Huh?
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
No.
I don't follow you.
Carl Smith.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
You owe me. Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's not mine.
Basil the II.
Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Does Carl Smith?
I've been to Church Hill.
I doubt that. Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You'll be safe here. He won't kill in a church.
Why not?
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
Where?
Dupont Circle.
At the moment? Carl Smith.
And you?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton. But you don't really care, do you?
He was innocent.
You?
No.
Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
You are being foolish.
Are you?
No one knows you're here?
No. I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
Our cars were seen together in Felton. They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I wish I could.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
They do it each year.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
There's a catch. You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
A little dusty.
Follow me.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Yes.
At least.
That's impossible.
A factor of age.
I hope I never get that old.
You won't.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
Yes.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Perhaps. There is something more. An inheritance.
Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
It's all the same. Half lives that never go away.
What is it you want?
All of it finished.
Will I see you again?
Be careful. Don't stay any longer than you have to.
I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't stand it!
I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
No!
I'll destroy you. I've destroyed everything I've ever touched! Oh God...
Not power. Not control.
You have lived forever.
I'm just curious.
You're never "just curious". You've met my neice, Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Call your mother. You never call her.
What do you want from me?
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
I want Taupin.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What were you doing in Felton?
Research. If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Don't be stupid, lady. Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
It's that important?
Yeah.
Not who. What. Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
Why?
He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-Luceat ei-
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Stop!
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist.
You're not from these parts.
I am from Spain. And I would like a moment of your time.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Aye.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Pheasant.
It was time for our paths to cross.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Not even a single lifetime.
What?
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
No!
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy. Accept it.
This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You'd have to die first. Aqui.
Then they were right. I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Oh my God. Oh my God I'm lost.
We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
Again. Try again.
Go to hell.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
All living things pay dues, Conor. They must be respected for that.
I'll be back when I can.
I have no future husband.
I don't understand. Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
What are you saying? I'm standing here as real as you.
Live? In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Me father has taken back my hand.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Do what you must.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Far away.
Kiss me.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Won't get it. We are a sacrifice. A diversion.
Not likely.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private. You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Equals?
If you wish to play games, Major.
We have no understanding.
It never changes, Major.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
I had no choice.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right. There is no Richard Taupin.
Not yet. Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon. Y'never know.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
No. I want this to be all ours.
I don't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him. He always does. Eventually.
He knows I'm here. How?
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.
Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
You were never a kid.
You're insane.
No, seriously. We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
You're wrong.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age. And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
As you wish.
This isn't done. Get up.
What's the point! You have me, finish it!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
And if I refuse?
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
Should I care?
Yes.
Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
That's none of your business.
You're wrong.
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
For the moment.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
He's mistaken.
All I need is time.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
Oh yes, more than enough.
His only kid.
Sure take after him. Never seen a father and son look more alike.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Hildy!
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
What's the idea of locking this?
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
Excuse me, I just want to --
The poem?... The poem was great!
What?
No. Roy. Roy V.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Exactly!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
No. It's strong. But I like it that way.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
But --
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Did you give her the money?
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
Yes!
Then who are you?
Where are we going?
No. My mother.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
How?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
So long.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Get out!
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!
No, you don't!
Do you want to get us scooped?
Get out of here, you!
Your luck's not with you now!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
The power of the press, huh!
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Done what?
I haven't any hard feelings.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Sweeney.
Dead?
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Thanks...
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
No kidding?
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Thank you.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
What do you mean?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Okay, Walter.
All right, Walter.
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
I'm finished.
Finished!
What did you do with her?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Flip a coin.
All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Thanks.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Now don't argue, Hildy. How about it, Judge?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
You -- you!!
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
I'm busy, Duffy.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
They can't do that to me!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I think it is.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Let me up.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike --- Mollie, I got it!
All right -- all right!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay. Up you go, Mollie.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Just coffee. And you, sir?
That's all right.
Good coffee, isn't it?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
What do you mean -- through?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
If there was any way out...
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
An attempt to ruin us!
Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
What is it?
I did. Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
A sight for sore eyes!
Throw him out, Frank.
I never saw him before!
I was just going to!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
All right, Judge.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt.
Where's the money?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
That's good.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Mother!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
How'd you get here, Earl?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
They're not human!
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Quiet, Mollie!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Ssh!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Forty dollars.
Who do you think!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
Yes, yes!
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
Hello, Mollie.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
But Grandpa, you said...
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Very well, Grandpa.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Apparently so.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Say them.
I only know one.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
...and six...
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
I'm starting my own collection.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
That's not the point.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
The sodding water table.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I swear I don't know. Here's your Christmas present.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Kiss me Hardy.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Propaganda. We've been had.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And absent bridegrooms!
And the bride.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
What's that?
You joined up.
Oh, that.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
You taste it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
No, I won't.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
How are we going to cope?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Grace!
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We did the decent thing.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Look after yourself, Grace.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Baby! Stop!
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Couple more miles up this road.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Come on.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Well, yeah, kind of.
OK.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
That's not something to joke about.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
You know... a couple of queers.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho.
Fucking great.
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah, I'll do something.
Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... ...Goober?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Holy crap, thanks!
Hey, wait take this.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about? A great American.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
But if you did.
I don't.
But suppose for a second you did.
She's pretty cute.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
OK, Boss.
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Hell yeah.
How much further?
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Thanks.
No problem.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Tasted pretty good.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Yeah, showtime for what?
That food... ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What?
What!
Fine! I'll go straight!
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
It won't work.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
That kid is one horny retard.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Can I get some stamps off ya? Did you fix the toilet yet?
I hear ya.
He should be back in a couple hours.
How's he get around out here?
Oh.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken. Anybody want some?
That seems likely.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
When you were outside with Bill.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Shhhhhh.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there... ...help, we're in here!
Help, help us.
Sleeping.
Rise and shine.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I resign.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Tell me about it.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
You got to be fucking joking.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
I can't believe...
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Recover any bodies?
Not yet.
That's the understatement of the year.
Yep, I suppose it is.
You find something, Georgie?
Yep, I found something.
Keys.
Open up the trunk.
Yes, sir.
Oh, right.
What do they call you, sweety?
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I was just kidding.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Firefly.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Huh?
You said it, not me.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
What! God damn, how many?
Who's your Daddy!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Well, go get her.
George Willis... ...any leads?
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
I ain't got a warrant.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call Wydell.
Right.
Yes, sir.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I pray to God there is.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
What.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
That must be him.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Excuse me for a second.
We found one.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And?
And think about what you've done.
It's going famously, son, famously!
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great. God, I've wanted you forever.
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Like father, like son.
French?
Oui.
Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Oui. Perfect!
Not at all.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Is everything fine?
Oui. Now you've got me talking French.
Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Oui.
That would be good.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You are sweet.
Shh.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit. Hi, honey.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Fine.
Not in front of the boy.
Very well.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
No!
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
I don't know.
Oui.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
No.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Ouch. Yeah?
You still in the market for a real boy?
Always. Ow.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Oh?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I think I'm going to.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
Lila, I want to help you.
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Ready!
With pleasure.
Oh, Rosie.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
As do I.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Where?
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
No biggie.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.
I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example?
Nathan!
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
Why certainly!
Terrific. Can't wait!
I don't think so. Why?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Flares?
Absolutely.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
I love you so much.
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I think he's feral.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
It's perfect!
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I have to think! I have to think!
You are an animal.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Good. Making progress.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
I guess.
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Absolutely!
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...
Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Ugnh.
Oook. Oook.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Lila?
Yahoo!
Tomorrow, the acid test.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Extra dessert?
Even better.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
here, here.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
No, why?
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
What do you guys sell?
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
No.
Check!
You look different... More relaxed.
Right.
It's open... What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I've never been to Louisville.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Do we need words?
To win.
For whom and for what?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
How?
You tell me.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
That's the way it's done.
Good, good.
You ever played billiards before?
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Cash.
How much do I owe you?
Twelve thousand.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What did he say?
Sit down.
Cut.
Deal.
Two.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
You being cute?
Character.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
What's that supposed to mean?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
For me.
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Kiss off.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I been thinking.
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
Where?
Over there by the bar.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How much?
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
I said we're leavin'.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
You name it, we shoot it.
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Whaddya mean?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Eddie...
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Hello, Eddie's girl... I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh yeah? Where?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Yeah. Just like that.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Glad to meet you.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
How much?
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
What time?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
By all means.
Okay?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Ten dollars.
Hi.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Okay, friend.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Try me.
Shoot.
Okay.
Call it.
Heads.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yes.
What?
How long have you been waiting?
Since four.
What bus?
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Can I buy you another drink?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What do you do on the other days?
I drink.
Hey!
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr...?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
No.
Fifth of scotch?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Why?
Come here.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
You want to go with me?
You got it all in your head?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Raw.
I've got something in my bag.
Oh, it's not bad.
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
No, stick around. Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean?
Give it back to me.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Me. It's Eddie.
I got beat up. They... They broke my thumbs.
No. You?
What's it so hot in here for?
A loser?
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You need the words?
Yes, I'm glad.
Two. Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
I feel pretty.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
First time for everything.
Nothin'. Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
For how long?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Sure. Let's go home.
Come here. Come on, now.
No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
He went off someplace.
Just for luck.
Well, what's the matter?
I'm a little tired.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
California. Oakland.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
That's right.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Hundred dollars?
You miss? Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Thousand dollars a game.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
No.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
Yes.
Do you want to go on?
It comes back. Flashes. My name.
It was warm. I was outside. The ocean?
What about... now?
With them?
Yes.
We move. Place to place.
Dark and large. With vines -- no, not vines. Not alive.
My wife.
Yes.
What?
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
You want to kill them.
You're not them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I know it. What do you want, Robert?
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I want to talk. I just learned again.
I'll go. We'll both go. Far away.
Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.
That sounds charming. Did you meet any interesting people today?
They are... sinister. They want to kill me.
That sounds charming. What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Stay alive.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Virginia...?
What?
Please.
Only got one kind.
That's fine.
You got that right.
I'm am architect. I'm working on a site back in --
You built things.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
Yes.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
There's Cassius ...
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Sure ... fine.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
First lemme look at your necks.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was so real, Dad.
I was so scared.
Better now, son?
That's Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Where's your car?
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
Good night.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Why, yes. Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
No.
Can you tell me about that?
Yes.
I'd believe him.
Why?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
Yes. I can even read star maps.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I don't see anything.
No, but it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
The State Police.
All their lines were busy.
Hide the car.
I know a way.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here --
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I'm not. They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone. We've got to get help.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
I know. But you have a full day of school tomorrow -- You, too.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I...
The back door was open.
What?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
This afternoon. It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I'll pack us a lunch. Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
What's his family background?
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
All right. I'll be right back.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Cool.
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
David, don't...
I take it you've heard.
A toast to the end of the world.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Did it work?
You bet it did.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
More than likely.
Then get them out of there.
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
What happened?
Just do it!
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Checkmate.
So think already.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You still got the Olds?
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
That's okay. You're driving.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
College nickname.
You try Martin?
She didn't take my name when we were married.
It's perfect the line is busy?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
He wasn't the President then.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Oh shit, we're late.
We'll meet you there.
Great.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
You as well.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
She should be shortly.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
ETA with target; four minutes.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Better than we thought.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Then find them.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Roger.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
How long would their shields be down?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
What?
Be careful.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
You know me...
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
Sorry for what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I didn't even see them fire!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
We're already over Mach 2!
So push it!
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
Just take it, dick head. Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
We're leaving.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
I said call them back.
Yes.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from? Where is your home?
Here... now.
And before here?
Many worlds...
What do you want us to do?
Die.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
You are on your own?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
The dog!? You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All your life.
All my life!
Yes. My treat.
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What is it?
Do you believe, Marcus?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
It looks like a converted church.
Where?
Dad was onto something here!
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Arghhh! Oh!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
That was our assessment as well.
Where did this come from?
Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe.
You could be more right than you know.
Yes?
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
Yes?
I knew it was you --
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
What?
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
How do you know?
Where is it? I want it.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
I came to get you! What do you think?
And the head. You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Good point.
Right.
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
Yeah?
Well, uh...
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Don't worry. He won't.
How did you she was a Nazi?
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Try and burn through the ropes.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What???
And the chair.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
Oh.
I'm out, Dad!
...the solution presents itself.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
What?
Stop! Stop!
Brody's this way.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Good.
Relax.
I was the next man.
Ships that pass in the night...
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
When?
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
More or less. Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
It happens to me all the time.
This could be close.
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
Junior...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man. The penitent...
Penitent. Penitent...
The penitent man is humble...
"J".
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
What did you find, Dad?
Me?... Illumination.
Junior?! Dad...
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir! Haaa!
Who are you?
A long time to wait.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
No camels!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where's my father?
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
No.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Just a routine inspection tour.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
You think so?
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Finally!
You should have been there...
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
There are no stories anymore.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
Nee chin lie how ma?
I don't like to show off.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
You're betrayed Shiva.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Siam.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too...
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
What?!
First of all -- don't panic!
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
PET IT??!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
Keep stroking it!
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I know the feeling...
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Oh really?
Maybe...
What does the writing say?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Just try and control yourself.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
No -- real food.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
Dr. Jones?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
Willie!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
No... the heart's still beating!
Quiet!
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Maybe... someday. Not today.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes.
So now they believe me.
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
Go!
What above the curves?!
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Not quite.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
What for?
I'm going to puke in it...
Willie, come on!
I know you did!
Who's you?
Al ???!!!
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Don't do that.
Why not.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I see...
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Shut up!
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Don't do it. Don't aim at the head.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
With a man in my head...
Yeah.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Outrun them.
This is a Fiesta!
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Then what are you stopping for?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah. Al wants to talk to you!
Why?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Find You?
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
Where are we going?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
The man.
I can't remember..
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Don't know.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Nothing!
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?
Just get there.
What is it?
...Just beautiful.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Good Idea!
Little late for that.
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
Where are you going? Wait!
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
A girl.
Follow it.
You're out of shape.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
Wait.
Where are you staying?
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
It worked.
I made it work.
Yeah. I did it.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What are you looking at?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Is something glinting?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Why not?!
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Doesn't.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. By the window.
Who, me?
The drinks...Stay on them.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Is that all?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
Shit! You're in love.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You get time off to sleep.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
It wasn't like that.
Why don't you get out of my face.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
That's not funny.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
Don't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
A hard left. A hard left.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
No. You can't trust her.
Probably.
I don't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Not sure at all.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
Well...?
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
While he makes the run.
Where?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
I can't handle that thing.
Don't worry, I can.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
...Shit! It's just money.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
And don't let her know, either.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
What exactly?
I don't know.
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
Looks like you can have all you want.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Oh no!
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
They can?
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
It'll remind me of you.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
Do what? What'd you do?
Don't give her your name.
Oh, I can't.
Good.
Dieter?
I insist.
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
What a nerve!
Rene?
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
Me.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Then how did you know?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
**?!!
Newer, more powerful design.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
He work for us?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
We met on the beach.
Join us.
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
It's just money.
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
We insist.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
And how do you service foreigners.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
I think I've heard of you.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
I will?
What?
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I don't know Who.
The little man in my... ...head...
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
A little voice in my head.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Sir?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Sir?
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
Yessir...very good sir.
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said something first.
I didn't say anything.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Yes?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
What way?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Yes, of course.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...I...don't know.
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
Just Okay...
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
That depends...
Why'd you run off?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
Got to trust someone.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And you?
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Then where's the chip.
He plays it all the time.
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Get us one.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Hong Kong.
What?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I asked him.
Oh.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've been there?
I know the territory.
You coming along?
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Nothing we can do.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Can't you do something?
It was my choice.
Why did you, then?
For you.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
I love you too.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Escape.
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
You're gonna laugh.
Her?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
We just don't stop.
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
I told you, I work for him.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Piece of mind.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
Why are you on to him?
I don't know.
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Thanks.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It is?
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
Yes.
The other working.
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Poor bastard.
What does he know?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
What about Al...
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
For reading.
Okay.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
Where?
In the backyard.
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
How long?
Three hours.
You got a deal.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
What do you mean, what's it do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Alright, alright.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
How about you?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
Lunch?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
I'm afraid you are.
No, I'm not...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay.
Catch ya' later.
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
How are you, Jim?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Catch you later.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Try the car.
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...
I'm doing an interview.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
That's for food.
Yes... Jeffrey.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Yes.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Hello? Yeah...
..."ignition propensity?" ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M." It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I have to take a shower.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey...
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
I'll call you then.
Yeah.
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
No shit.
What's this?
What do you mean?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
Good.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
What?
I'm with Don on this.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Oh, lots.
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Everything interests me.
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.
That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please.
Black, black...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Like what? Your sign?
Far as you go where?
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Fuck you, too!
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
Good. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
They should be.
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
You okay?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's okay.
Tempura...
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Yes.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
Jeff...
I'll call them, Lowell.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I heard.
Did you have a good day?
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
I don't know what to do.
You mean... since this morning?
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's not the point.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What?
Hello, can you hear me now?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
No, you can. Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
A delivery device for nicotine.
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Seven...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
He --
Here. Got pictures.
Howard!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
After you, Doll.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I had no idea until after, but --
I just want to make sure that you both --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Who do you want me to kill?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
No...
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
Sustained.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
No frown lines. New watch?
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
I should be in therapy.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Oh. I thought maybe -- Gee!
I already made my move, Kenneth.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Yes.
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Huh?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Ruth Rabino.
No.
You like kids.
It's about time.
I said yes.
I think Ming is older than Tong. What is this?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
I'll be right back.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
What does your lawyer think?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Absolutely.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Marylin! Listen to me.
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Have you tried the duck?
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
No. Don't stop.
Okay Miles.
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
No, we're not!
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
I want... I want to...
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know.
I have a watch.
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
I bet.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
May I come in?
I don't believe you have "things."
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
What kind of "stuff?"
Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's marriage.
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
No buts. Now. Out.
I fell in love Miles.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
You do? You do love me?
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
It's not something I wanted either.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
I thought so.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
Please!
You used his credit card.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Wow.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
We do have a man for you.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Right.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Well, that's about to change big time.
I guess.
Yes?
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
When you have a moment.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
She's here now.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
Now Rex.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
But then... But then...
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Nothing?
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
What are they?
Berry spoons.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Do you have it?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
-- the coin?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's "Patty."
Three is not Farrow.
Who's Rex's guy?
Muriel Rumsey.
It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I knowbut
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not. Yes?
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America.
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Nothing.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No.
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him. Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
It'll do no good. He despises me.
Oh, come now
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I don't know.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Yes. Peter Warne.
Why? Do you know him?
Oh, nono.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, Dad
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Lower the boats!
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Sock her!
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Yes, of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
They're practically all the same, sir.
Amateurs!
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
But the lady says
What happened to your money?
Thanks.
. . . turn."
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
No.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Ohthe papers
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
You win!
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, noI Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
No, thank you. Thank you so much.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
What are you talking about?
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Beat it!
You have your nerve! Here, boy!
You're on a budget from now on.
Shut up!
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is colossal.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
The pleasure is all mine.
What is it? Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Heretake mine.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I'll find it myself.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night. Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
KingKing Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
That's Father at work, What'll I do? Peter, what'll I do?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Well, you were!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
After that "The Three Musketeers." I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I refuse to resign!
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
What's the matter?
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Sorry. It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Well, take them off.
What!
Oh, Peter
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
What?
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Try me.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitch-hiking.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
Hayin my teeth.
Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Carrots.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
Mind your own business.
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never! I'm going in and ask him
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come onget in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on!
What happened?
A black eye.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?
Yeah, swell.
Nope.
Why not?
Me?
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
I'm out! I'm out!
Whome? Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Well, I am.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
Not interested.
Won't I ever see you again?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Sorry, Miss.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, he'll be back.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Get out!
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
What's that?
Yes?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
Just your imagination.
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Thanks.
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Yes.
Don't accept any more.
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out!
Don't "Joe" me.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
What!
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah.
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Okay, pete.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
When you sober upcome in and see me.
Thanks, Joe.
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
A trumpet?
I dunno.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Mush. Mush.
Collect?
Collect.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Mebbe.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
I don't trust him.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it? Here's the woman, ma.
Oh!!
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Zeke. Git!
Yes, Ma.
Hey, you!
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Say, Buddy
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why?
Five G'sor I crab the works.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?
Whyno
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Sure. Anything you say.
Not one word. That's an order.
Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
No!... Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This is incredible.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.
You, Numa?
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Shaw. Clay Shaw.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.
Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Yeah.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Dave?
I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.
I got no place to sleep. I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.
What do you mean?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
What was so appealing about Houston?
No particular reason. Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I don't know. Were you? Who you scared of, Dave?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No.
But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others. There were admirals.
There were admirals.
What?
That's our case!
Well, I am saying it. Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper. What is it?
A rhinoceros. Can I stay up another hour?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No. I had guns all my life. I used to go turtle shooting.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Four to six.
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans! It's outrageous!
No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
I know.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
David Ferrie.
No. I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Naturally. Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Liz, I'm really sorry. The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
What?
A man just called. He asked her everything!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'm leaving. I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving! I won't stand it anymore.
Is it such a chore? I don't understand you.
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.
Well... yeah.
Boss, the President's been shot. In Dallas. Five minutes ago.
No word yet. But they think it's in the head.
Yeah, Guy Banister. Ex-FBI man. He died couple years ago.
Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Take a look across the street.
Between six and seven seconds.
How many men?
No.
Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
Who?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Are they? Why would they?
Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.
No, it can't!
Yes.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
It never did.
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
You have other information?
Was he there often?
And Oswald?
Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
The assassination, Jack?
You're so naive, mister.
You just need some sleep, Lou. It won't look so bad when...
I just don't want to do it. What else?
Splendid, love to see them.
Germany.
How many men are working with you on this?
That's it.
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
I need some information from you then. How old are you?
Six.
And how tall are you?
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Uh huh.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Thanks.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
I won't forget.
You were there for me.
Who?
You.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Go ahead.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
In his inside coat pocket.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
She knows it's my case?
Sure.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Arrest me.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
What's in it?
Beauty products.
That's my diet shit.
Take your time.
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
You're serious?
In cash.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I am, as a matter of fact.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Yeah.
Sure.
It looks nice.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Really?
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Bigger?
Yeah.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
I don't care.
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
I see.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You're avoiding the question.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
The day you got me out of jail?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
More or less.
Which one?
What if I've figured a way?
Do you think they bought it?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I'm sure.
I told him I might.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
You'll get over that.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
Do you live together?
Not every day?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
You planted that shit on me.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
We can look into that.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
If I'm working, I can help you.
You never asked me if I did or not.
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
You two meet?
Not really.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
I never have. It's not my money.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Uh-huh.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
What did you do after that?
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Great... ...Wanda!
Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
Dreaming.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Got some o.j.?
Yeah.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
They asked.
And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
They told me.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I told them.
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
Who?
What'd you care?
I need to talk to you alone.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Man, I don't like that part.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
No thanks.
The roller disco one.
Fourteen.
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Were you a disco girl?
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Must of made quite an impression.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Yeah.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Does that bother you?
You live with him.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
...and just take it from him.
All right already.
Are you sweating?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
This one.
You sure?
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Sure. We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
I dunno.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
The moon -- I dunno
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
So we on the same page then?
I follow.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Sure.
What's your relationship?
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
I told you, man. She my fine little surfer gal.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
I shot her.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Pull the car over.
It's in there.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
What?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.
Max Cherry.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
How am I supposed to know that?
Hold on a minute. Where you going?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Watcha gonna see?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Have fun.
They don't have your winning personality.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have it with you?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
I know that.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Livingston, huh?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
I need your name and address.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House or apartment?
House.
Now I need you to count your money.
Yes.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Is that what I think it is?
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Git your ass in here.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
That I gotta see.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
She will.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yes.
You better be, motherfucker.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
I was gonna tell you...
No problem.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
He's around.
Give me his home number.
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home? This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
No! Oh God.
No, thanks.
It's fun.
Della?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
No, don't. But thanks.
How do you know?
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Me, too.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
LET GO!
I could have told you that.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Just my luck.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe? What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
Don't go.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I am.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
But the paper ...
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
What else did he say, Jake?
He told me he was going to Hell.
A couple of weeks, I think.
No. Not really ...
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
... I've seen them, too.
Shit!
An explosion, just like Paul's.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
Sarah.
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
What?
I know.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Likewise.
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
No. I see them.
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I need your insight, your intuition.
Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
What's your name?
Jacob Singer.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Save me!
Your back? Did you fall?
Who did?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
Where to?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
I must have been out of my head.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What's in here?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
Why you left.
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I just want to look ...
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
I enjoy crushing into you.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
They're like demons, Jez.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
They weren't human!
Come on. What were they, Jake?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Here. I'll do it.
Am I home?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I want to know. You tell me!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
It might be for me.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
What's gotten into you?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Please.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh? Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
Goddamn you!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know who I am.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
Who then?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
For what? For seeking the truth?
Please come quietly.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
We're not going to hurt you.
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.
I work in a bakery.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Count 'em on one hand.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What's wrong?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything. Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.
On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Punk?
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
Pause play.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Yes it does.
Oh, come on!
Alright, asshole.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have time to argue!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Could you show a little compassion?!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
We don't have a choice!
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
What?
I don't know. Nothing.
We made it?
Done?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Rizzo did.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Get out of here!
What?!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
And you said high school was boring.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Where'd you get the gun?
I think I broke my arm.
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
They're back here.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We could convert fission transistors.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Hey, easy now.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
You're a teacher.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
My job.
Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
What?
Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Roger that. Time to kick some ass!
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
No you don't!
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
I guessed.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey!!
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
And what happend to ...?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
You?
Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction.
Oh sure, all the time.
Eat me.
Okay, good tip.
You'll be fine.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
I think so, why?
I know you.
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
She broke my fucking nose!
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
Oh I like her a lot.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Well, do something!
Shut up, Thorgan!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
NO!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
GO, GO, GO!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
Small brains make your balls itch?
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
You prefer an apple?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Jesus! Can't you knock? Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
I'm just saying.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You need to get laid!
Are there any other shuttles?
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Oh shit! There he is!
Sory...
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Who are you apologizing to?
Good point.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Oh, alright.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
No! He's coming with us!
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Ssh.
I just know.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
What?!!
I gotta go back.
But?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
See you then . . . doctor.
Obviously so.
Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
30? How long was I out?
But...I...400 years?
That's right, now if you could...
Get him out of there!
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You wanna die?
Are we locked down?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
4You're not going anywhere.
You're crazy!
Three...two...one...
Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Old Earth?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
It's okay.
My boat's neat, dad!
I want him out of the ocean.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Sure, Dad.
Here -- Take him home.
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
It's my charter. My party.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I almost had 'im.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Where...?
The bilge pumps. There --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
No! No! No! Swing around! After him!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Have you ever had one do this?
No!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Full throttle! To port!
He's taken him!
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Like you're from N'Yawk.
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Feed the dogs.
Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
I think they make you look sexy.
Older, sillier.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
What'll I tell the kids?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Do I need any more authority?
I didn't agree to that!
Sure he is.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I'm going home.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Why?
Just sign it, Larry.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.
Swell.
Let's all have a drink.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Rogue?
Our friend, the shark.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What? What?!
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
What do we do?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
They must've hit something.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Be careful, for chrissake.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
No... You think we can get back with those?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I can't imagine why.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Set?
Twenty years.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Is anyone having this...?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
Well... is everything all right?
I've got all these signs here...
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
Transplants?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Let me see your hands...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Down here, Hooper!
Fasten the pole.
What do you see?
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
And I'll drink to yours.
The shaft is giving.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I don't have it.
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Cool.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole. So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
I know.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Charisma?
Or something.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
Well, I do.
Were we together?
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
What?
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...
Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yeah. That was me.
Why?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
What, you mean as friends?
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Mine too.
Okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
What is your job title, exactly?
Excuse me?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
I know enough.
Oh, go fly a kite.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Yeah.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I wrote that.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
You're kidding!
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
We definitely want it to have junk.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Hey, I like this.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Uh, thanks.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Why?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Cute?
Consider it your musical education.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
Come on, I have something for you.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
I actually know this one.
You do?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I don't know.
What?
No?
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Vanessa, right?
Sure.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh really?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
This is the baby. Your baby.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Elbow.
Wow! It's magical.
Nothing.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, she does.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Yeah, like people in love.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Tore up from the floor up?
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...
Thundercats are go!
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
It was magnificent, man!
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Share the love, Tits!
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
They're yellow.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
Can you see it?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What are you referring to?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Don't mock me.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Thank you.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
...Yeah, sure.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
So you don't do any of those things.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
How'd you meet Early?
You can?
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.
Took 'em all.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Yeah.
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
...That's not true.
What?
That's not true!
Early, you are so sweet.
Almost.
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
...I don't know.
Well Adele... it was for... ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Early! Stop!!
Walter Livesy.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
Brian.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Who?
Henry Lucas.
...Then some.
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
Yeah.
You wanna hear mine?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Nah... how much money have you got?
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
...Ha.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.
Thank god!
A... I gotta go.
The party?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I do.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Why?
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I still think we should have met them first.
Lighten up...
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
I heard that.
Carrie.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Look again!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I'm finished.
Why, what did he do?
Then try again,
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Not yet.
Nervous?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
No, thanks, I can manage.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Shut your mouth.
Everybody just shut up!
...You're hurting me...
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Who are you?
His Parole Officer.
Where would we find him?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
17.
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Yes.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Yes!
You're clean.
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, that's the best.
What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
How?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
To what? Virgins?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
What do you want?
Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
What for? That guys a dick.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Why?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
The cartoon?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yeah me too nigga.
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah. She's only 13.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Right.
Good luck?
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Yeah.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Fifteen for me.
Yeah probably.
You are?
Why not? You stink.
Hold up man.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where is he?
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I had a female vagina last night.
Na.
You sure?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Is it cold?
You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
Yeah.
You were?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
She won't? Why not?
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yes.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I like you too.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
But I'm scared Telly.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing?
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Do you care about me?
Of course I do.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No...
Here. Swallow.
Yeah.
What do I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why?
Because, you know why. You know.
Because your a virgin?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
Of course I do.
What?
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
I guess so.
15.
One.
Were you protected?
No.
What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
But I only had sex with Telly.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Am I getting warm?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You still mad at him?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Mine?
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah is dissdee?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Making love is like.
Sweet.
It's like...
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
You think so?
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
No.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
That's right.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
OK.
Yes.
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.
What are you saying?
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
You are! I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
No.
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
What?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me. You got that?
That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
What do you want?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!
Get off me!
What?
Sit down!
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
Local?
No. She just moved here last month from Portland.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You think he's dirty?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Anything?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
It's a voice modulator.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Who is this?
Just a second. Hello?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.
You'll find her.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
I know what I said! She looks just like...
Just like who?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
You sonofabitch!
Emotional? I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I've figured out the message.
The game's over. You lost.
It's me you want. Not her.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies.
Very good. How did you know?
The pipes.
You don't understand.
Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Never mind. He died two years ago.
1985. Hans Korshaud.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.
The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Fuck off!
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
Come here.
He was watching you.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Not really. It's pretty boring.
Of course.
How do you know that? Did he say something?
No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Okay.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Nothing.
Thanks, David.
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today.
But you promised.
Who's Kathy?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
Bingo.
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
No Frank. No prints.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
And this Jeremy--
--Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want that area blanketed.
This ain't no photo.
Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
About a quarter to one.
What does that mean?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
We've already met. Haven't we... Doctor.
That's alright. We'll take it from here.
"Is". Did you tell him about the institute?
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
That's got to be it.
Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I signed the confession. What about the car?
It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car.
Then I'll transpose.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Is it serious?
I want to be the best I can.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
No.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.
Thank you. I'm at 639-7393.
We'll call you back.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you earlier about a book.
What are they, please?
"Carefully". "Carefully". "Carefully".
It's alright.
Yes.
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing. I just came in for a steam.
No you didn't.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key. The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now. I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
I don't think I could.
It wasn't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
That's not fair!
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Why?
Because I work with them.
You're not?
No -- I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
How could you? Unless you were there.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
No. But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No. You were talking about chess.
Alright. What about me?
I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It's alright. It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.
And you?
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What? By attacking me?
Does anyone?
Then show me who you are.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Call room service.
What do you want on it?
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
If I have to. I'm going to take a shower.
The line was busy. I'll try again.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it?
Exactly. It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
Where's the note?
Can I come in?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
You don't understand.
Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
It's not that easy.
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
Frank told me.
No he didn't.
He didn't tell you either.
Of course not.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah. I'll be there later.
I got lucky.
I'm not nervous.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Me too.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Well, you're beautiful.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
I can't.
About what?
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I know it.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn.
You must move away from the Center.
All the passages are guarded.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
I knew you would come.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
Of course it was.
You can't reach her! Through the door. Quickly!
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
But there is another entrance to this place.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You won't have to.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Yes.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.
Saddles.
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I don't think that.
Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
Even by you?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
You will not, then?
I cannot.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
What business?
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
My <u>friend</u>.
I have need of friends.
What else is left for a man without friends.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I know you.
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
I'm all right.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
We must try to get horses.
A flicker of talent.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
At the gallop!
Naturally.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Would you settle for a boar?
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Me. May I eat with you tonight?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I'm glad. I'm very glad.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
No.
A small house.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
And mine goes with you.
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
You can have half.
Smart lad. Bring me my spices!
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
I don't think it's working.
Would you desert your friends?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
You had better manners as a pig.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Food for crows.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Oh, my poor stomach.
Hush!
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He is the King.
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
Then he will die!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Yes.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her.
Many have perished in that maze.
Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is too late. He has drunk.
Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
I killed him when he was born. This place is my punishment.
It is no trickery.
Those are reflections. <u>This</u> is my face!
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
No.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You will come with me.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good... But what's special in him?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Well, I don't need them...
Good.
130... 140...
How can you say it?
Oh really? But can you miss the car?
Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
Whoever.
Perfect.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
Yes, yes...
What?
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Yes.
No.
For musicals? That's part of the job!
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Too heavy.
I never rent my gear.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, stop, please!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK. I love you anyway.
Mathilda?!
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
I think.
...Later.
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Yes.
Three times, then two times.
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yeah, what?
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Mathilda, listen!
No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby. I don't know any Danielle.
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Fine...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh? That's smart!
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
...No... he's my lover...
Huh? Why?
Ten dollars... A month.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Messina.
Emilio? Due grappe! ...Why the hell did you come here?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
Yes... Twice.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
No...
Salute.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Where?
For a walk. I don't know.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I'll make it.
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children. They're really special.
How serious is it?
What?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
I won't let you die.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
You need a ride, Preacher?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
Pardon?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You have?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
What?
The new store?
Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
Yes.
Anything?
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish it?
Then why?
There's no reason.
Show me.
I will -- I promise.
You like to take walks?
No. But I want to take a walk with you.
Please tell me.
I've changed my mind.
You can't change your mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
Yes.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
It'll make it.
He's plastered.
That's okay -- really it is.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Did you have a dream?
Where?
Pacifica, California.
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.
Good.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I see.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts? About what?
About my love for her.
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.
Red flag, man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague? Why so evasive? He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
Jumped where?
Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn car!
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Yeah!
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You tell stories?
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Making the grand total?
What was that?
Perhaps there's another route?
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Umm, no. It's just that --
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
You're amazing.
It has to be a full character's name.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Write from your heart. That's why the classics are great.
Yes.
Where?
California.
Tomorrow.
Walking where?
California.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I told you.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city. That's good.
She knew you loved her.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
Why know?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
So I've been informed.
She never ate a slice.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You're amazing.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
What, come on?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Which hospital? Did you take me back?
Steph.
Do you have a car, Steph?
I need your help.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
You should. Children are a blessing from God. I have four.
Forty-seven years.
Yes.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
What do you mean?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What? Who are you?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
It's yours.
This isn't right.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Water?
Hello.
Are you working?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
No -- S.E.R.A.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I guess I do too.
You what?
I sometimes fade out.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
You were going to get my door.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.
To death?
Yes, that's right.
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Thank you. What time is it?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Yes.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What do you mean?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
What?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sorry.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Well... OK...
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Then come. I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
When?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
What do you mean?
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just ignore it?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
No... we already talked about that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Yeah... I'd like that.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Yes.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Please, Yuri.
I've been all right.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
It's me, Yuri.
No.
Yuri... are you...
Sera... please go.
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
Get up.
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.
Who?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
How?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
No.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Yes.
Yes.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Who's askin'?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Yes, I am.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Was she carrying a weapon?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
What?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
See?
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I think so...
How about --
I don't know.
Spill.
No!
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she as pretty as you?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
No.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
How'd it go at the trial?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really? Thanks.
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
What?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Yes, he is.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Thank you. I love you, too.
So?
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
No way --
Margot!
Not yet.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Did she do that to you, too?
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Aside from that.
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
But maybe it is --
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
So?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
What?!
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I'm quitting.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
So Friday at eight?
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
What happened?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
Absolutely!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
What?
I got bangs!
Really --
Where's Warner?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
I do.
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? See you tomorrow!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Maybe she found him like that.
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
Your what?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I guess it'll have to...
So are you!
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me?! I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
No.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Uh -- sure.
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Thank you.
See?
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Really?
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Yes.
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Three months.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Chuck.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Why do you say that?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Cunnilingus?
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Yeah, luckily.
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Then we smash 'em?
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Purely a precaution...
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am afraid of nothing.
Then why hide behind a mask? You are ashamed!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
What do you want from me?
At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
And then?
Yes?
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I see...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
I don't expect you'd understand.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.
Or looked so beautiful...
Yes. I feel that, too. Weakness is what is ugly.
I didn't know... I --
What? Speakee loud! No hear velly good.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Course not. I no flum here. I come flum Cathay.
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away. To the East, beyond the lising sun...
East of Mercia?
Dlagon not like that. Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's terrible.
An' how you do it? How you rift cuss?
Oh no... Don't you understand?
No more listening! Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Gump, is it?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
To be sure.
Dance, Jack! The night's but begun.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now? Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
And if I cannot?
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
What!
The flower. Bluebells. To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You have me word, lad. To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I fear she's lost.
It looks... er, delicious... Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Please don't misunderstand. I am grateful for your hospitality and --
He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Big question that, lad. Why what?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Don't you know?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry.
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear? Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye. Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
You do the praying. I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Screwball! You dolt! I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Careful, lad.
The colt's still too small.
Aye! That too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Aye. And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Whatever for?
Jenny Greenteeth said: "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Sounds like the bird we want. All right lads, follow yon raven!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Good plan that.
Blackheart?
Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest. Mayhap I can cut them free.
Jack, don't!
What know you of fields of war?
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Certainly understandable.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
There's the way, mates.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
Stay on your guard, Jack. The bug is enchanted surely.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north. We continue in that direction.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Nay. This time we strike first!
Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends.
I know the rogue, Jack. Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
We do both. Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already.
Easily spoken...
Never mind. Just do it! Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
There must be some way to get it up there.
That's it!
Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye. We're good as inside.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nonsense! Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
The wound is mortal.
Nay. You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Can you save her?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Sunlight, you say?
Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
What weapon?
Sunlight.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Patience, lad.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Don't get too far!
Hurry up!
Never show mercy!
I could have struck off his head just now!
Sapphire!
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him. Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where?
By the pond. She was teasing me.
Go on... go on...
I'll try.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Hush up, Screwball. Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
Very thrifty. Even got your arrow back.
They've fired the moat!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
If you like.
Never.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Or perchance...
Oh, fie. What about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
All right. I'll show you something sacred.
Stop complaining.
A gentleman would offer water.
Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
I detest serpents.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What shall we do?
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Don't leave me now. I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'm not its master.
The napkin will keep. I'd rather not be alone.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Shhh!
I am a princess. You have no right to order me about.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet. True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one? It would thrill me so.
Are you honest?
Jack!
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I've no fear of failure. Your implications are most unbecoming.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.
Who?
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters. It was a trap, and you were the bait!
My own father...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.
He did run?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Its powers are strong.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Tis the truth.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?
What if I answer yes? Will my wish come true?
Jack... Forgive me...
Only what's right...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, Jack...
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No! Don't let go... you mustn't! I love you!
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Seemed like weeks and weeks. Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
You're teasing still.
And I love you, my husband.
Ouch! Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching? Where?
Everywhere! Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts.
Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Why then, there thou hast. We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir! A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay. Tempting as your invitation be. Tell me one thing more.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Princess? I know of no princess.
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You'll visit again?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I pray God grants it me.
Sorry.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No fear of that now.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Fie! Don't speak of charms. I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
You... you... you mortal you!
Please...
You beware, Jack! You and your porridge-pot heart!
True north... Straight up that pass, through the net.
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Of course they're alive. All nature is living.
Up ahead!
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line?
It's done... we'll never catch him.
No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
May God protect you.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You do know where it is?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Nay. Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
You've been inside?
In a dream.
What are you doing?
I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
He was there and then he wasn't!
I thought I might stop by.
I wanna be with you today.
Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
We can work.
Since seventh grade.
Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"?
He's here. Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere. He's not there.
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are you?
What color?
Red.
I love red! That's my favorite color!
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
Why?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Is that legal?
Nope.
Monday.
What's that?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
You're a good girl.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him I said "hi".
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
No. That's okay.
Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
Turn over.
I can use your mom's.
I'm okay.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel.
Does everything have to have a point?
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
I'm not gay.
You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just friends.
Okay. I guess.
Are you afraid of heights?
What?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Not if what he left me was real.
He asked where you were! He wants you with him.
I don't wanna go.
Floating to Catalina.
What?
He's got a standing invitation.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Will he talk to me?
No.
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
We've known each other since grade school.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
Months.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.
How's your wife?
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy.
All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
That's too long.
How old are you?
Forty.
We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
I hate this job.
What are you talking about? You love your job.
From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it.
For everything.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Good. I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
Well, it's the least I can do.
Yes, it is.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Oh...okay.
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Not a shower.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
We're getting out of the ground today.
It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.
He escaped. He's going back in.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I don't know.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
I know what the deal is. Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
You don't know what the deal is. There is no fucking deal.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
No I'm not!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
I'll get your bag.
You have everything?
You don't have a choice.
Mom...please.
I almost saw Catalina.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
Don't touch me! You can't touch me!
Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude.
No you don't.
Why?
It bugs me.
You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you. I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
No.
Try it. It feels good.
Hi, Mom.
I know. Why?
I like how it feels not to feel.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
That's not true.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
What do you know about me?
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
That's so weird...
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
She seemed upset.
What's wrong with your back?
No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
Yes.
You lied to me!
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Here.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I can die trying.
I haven't been touched in years.
Left you this place.
At least your father tried, George.
I know there's an explanation.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
I want you to find someone for me.
I don't let him. He just loves to.
Three.
Oh. Sorry.
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You let him pierce his nose?
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He doesn't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days. I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Money?
Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Where will you live?
The garage.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend. For the summer.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Forget it, really. I'll survive.
I want him with me.
No, you don't. Trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No. I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
What?
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I was here six years. And I only hated two.
Which?
The first and the last.
Sam's favorite.
I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.
Oh...with his ear infection!
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight. It's like foresight without a future.
You're not well.
My stupid back.
He won't use my shower. I don't get it.
Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
You're a good mother.
I think so.
This was my very first slow dance.
I smiled at him.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse.
No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
Going on?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
What did I say?
You've never said that before.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
I need to know.
You need to know what? Do I still love you?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
What did he say?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
You got the money?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
I could use the money.
Who?
I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
The payoff.
A man he respects.
Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
I'll make you something.
Should I?
It would worry me.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Sooner than the Fall.
Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
What?
You can't go because of Sam?
I know.
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
I'll be in the bedroom.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I feel in love with George again.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Take it off.
Either do you.
Hey.
You got a dog?
It's not ours. It's George's.
Why?
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Okay.
I didn't go in your room.
I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out!
Can you stay for dinner?
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
Why?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
I just thought it would be nice.
Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Yes, it is.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Not for me, it ain't.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But you can't.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Sharp.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She's alright, isn't she?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Why not?
She got married last month.
Married?
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, Claude.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Sure, boss.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Here!
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink? Two bourbons.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Good old Monroe.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.
Nothing.
No, tell me what's so funny.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
What'd you say?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
What ain't there?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Winston. His name's Winston.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
He does it all by himself.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
What about you, Radio?
So?
You know what I'm saying.
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
You still got that map?
Yeah.
I said you're soft.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Let me take a look at that map.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You drew this?!
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I'm stuck!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
Say what?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
I can't eat it with mustard.
What am I gonna eat?
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Him?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Crawfords.
Whatever.
Let me see that.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Make 'em throw strikes.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
That was five years ago.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Goodnight, Ray.
Don't touch that car.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Why the hell not?
You didn't get ketchup?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
So?
They're touching.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
You killed Santa Claus?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
What were they, bootleggers?
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Rayford!
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
He must still be in there.
It'll be too late.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Something like that, yes.
She give you that scar, too?
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.
Anybody else need anything read?
Satchmo.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Understood.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
You shouldn't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
He's sick?
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Absolutely not.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
What do you think about... Earth?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
It's our time, brother.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Noon...
Sure, why not?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Uh. No it won't?
Urr... uggg... errr...
I'm calling you out, brother...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
Show him Central Park.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Angels don't get any older, son.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
She's so nice.
Yeah, you do...
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
No.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I can't screw. I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Oh. Sorry.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Put it in your mouth.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Son, just do your best.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Coulda been much worse.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Beast.
I know, your wickedness.
It's Stanley, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
No.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
'Bout time...
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Should we wake him up?
Yeah. You do it.
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
Peppermint... alright.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
That way.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
See ya, fellas.
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I was DeNiro!
All right...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Andrew.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
Really?
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Why are you laughing?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
You have a dog? What kind?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
My perfume?
Good. I was concerned.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
What?
What was that?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Yes...
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
From my dad's side of the family.
I love you.
I love you.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Yeah. The deep South.
I don't know.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
See something you like, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Your turn.
Anything to eat?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
From? From? From?
Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!!
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
It'll be all right...
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
We're ready.
Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
Your own work?
And I did it myself right on there.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Not in my time...
Just wondered... what happens?
Well... you can't have them all.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Of course.
Anybody we know?
At Carousel tonight?
It has nothing to do with you.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Why did you do that???!!!
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Please... No.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I thought I had to do something.
And?
I changed my mind.
And now?
Curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
Not about that.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed. Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6?
Six. I go red next year.
K.
You're sure you don't want to try?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Here I am. Shall I come in?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Maybe... sure...
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
Then it's still no.
You know.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
All right.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't..
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
That's tomorrow.
I wish I could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
That's nice.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
No. Not that either.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
We'll convince them.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
It's the only way.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
And yours.
We'll be all right... We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
Then the answer's yes...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
One in a million, I suppose
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't. We're going back.
To what?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
And Sanctuary?
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Beloved wife...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Yes...
Are you sure?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
No.
All this. All of it.
What people?
I don't know... but it does.
What's that?
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
At least it's over...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
Do you want to see Doc?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
Have any other people ever passed through?
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
Not yet.
All right.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Alive?
More... many more.
And all alive you say?
Oh, yes... I think...
I'm sorry.
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me.
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Listen.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
What?
You okay?... What's wrong?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
What is?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Right... This just glided along.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
As best we can.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Or something.
Or not so recently?
Yeah.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Over there.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Okay, baby.
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
I used to.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Yeah.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...
How'd it happen, Alice?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Yeah. Call him.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Yes.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Alice, I...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
What night is that?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Do ya good.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No.
Yes.
His physical condition.
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
No.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
He didn't come home.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
A headache?
I... I didn't say anything...
FUCKIN' "A".
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Tone deaf.
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
No, nothing.
Maybe.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yeah?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
I guess so.
All right.
Two detectives are coming out.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
What?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
Why would anyone do something like this?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Just a minute.
But...
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
No... of course not.
They're gonna cook him.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
The heart, I guess.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
All right!
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
I can see that.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
What'd I tell ya.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
It'll be ready.
You're my man, Pete.
Okay.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
You know who it is.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
You're doin, okay? That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Yeah.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
We just killed a couple of people...
What?
Yeah?...
Yeah.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
Sure.
Sorry... I...
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.
Sure. Sure I do.
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Come on... get in.
I do like you, Sheila.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
I was?
Yeah.
Come on.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Oh, read it!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Thank you.
Yes.
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Oh, I see.
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister. No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Look here
Oh, really?
Yes.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Yes!
Do you think they're cannibals?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
No kidding?
Yes.
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.
Uh-huh. Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Sounds like a stall to me.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Horns?
Horns? What kind of horns?
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Certainly not!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
I'll say.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
Gold. You were going to
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
Well - I'm
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
How do you do?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
In time you will meet them all.
We follow many.
Oh, good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, it must have taken
Centuries.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Who?
You're startled?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
I surprise you? Now that's news.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Well, then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along?
Shall we have another?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Yes, charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Suppose she should leave it?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
It's weird. Chang, how old are you?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors? That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
No porters here!!
No.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
Pardon me
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, dear.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Yes.
What is it, my son?
Sondra Bizet.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Yes.
Hello? Colonel?
Come on! Quick! This way.
You?
Yes, Bob.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Yes.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It looks like it. Smell those fumes?
Dead?
See that spot?
Yes.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
Well - I mean
Uh-huh.
Porters?
Let me go, Bob!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Enough! Never mind the girl! Well, why don't you go?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad!
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
Why not?
She came here in 1888!
Yes.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
What if he refuses?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
We'd be eternally grateful if you
My name's Sondra.
hope you'll forgive me for
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
A man whose life was empty!
Yes, I know.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I wonder.
Bump?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
You see, it's not a dream.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Struggling, why?
I'd love it!
Why?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
It's Fenner.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Yes. Barney!
Please don't go.
I'm sorry. I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you! You will come today?
Perhaps.
Thank you.
Hesitated, sir.
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.
The hell were you thinking?
It's not even a fucking door.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
You got smeared.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
I gotta be honest about something.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
They don't?
For instance... It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
It'll make sense later?
No. But You'll get used to it. Welcome to the Men in Black.
You do?
Yes, air. But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
I'd go with number three.
What? I thought you just--
Oh yeah? The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Don't worry about it.
Yup. Sure is.
Kay...
What? Who the hell are you?
INS, Washington. Special services.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
You heard me. You two, especially.
I understand. Hey, it works for the Hasids, right? No one recognizes them.
Right.
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
This is a college? I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
She didn't even know you. .
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha. No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
Why?
Um-- Kay?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A what?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Hold it.
Gee. You really think?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
What?
Where to?
I think that's what's happening...
That's the Loch Ness Monster. And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Get back in the car!
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
I dunno, man. Maybe we should.
What if he's telling the truth?
You know something? I actually never think of that. I gotta get some coffee.
I know what you're saying. And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
I know you don't trust him. You don't trust anybody--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
For how long?
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Right. Oh, and here.
Actually, it is a shotgun. Hold onto it--
in case I need it?
In case I need it.
Kay!?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
There wasn't time, sport!
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Me, too. I feel a long day coming on.
Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Actually, you may have.
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
What is it?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
So... how did they get here?
What do we do? Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
Are you sure you don't?
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Maybe you need a closer look.
You figured what?
I understand. I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Yes. Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
You're not taking me in!
What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?
We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
Nothing.
Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Nope. Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that? Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
The what?
Seriously. I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Wait-- listen--
Fine. Good.
So whattya say, kid? You in or out?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.
What the hell is going on?
What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell. I hope not.
Dee? What are you doing here?
What do we have? Are we showing anything?
They went right to the President.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
Just a guess. But I think found a nest.
Can you see?
What?
Is it now?
They're inside.
Who?
Agatha...
Can you see the balloon man?
What?
Forget that guy --
Do it. Right here. On the ground.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Wait.
Anderton, leave.
Please --
What is it?
You were right. I'm not being set up.
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Why?
The other two will die without me.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
I am going back. I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She grew up.
She's still alive?
Oh, Jesus...
What --
RUN!
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Found? Where?
Somewhere.
Because I found out about her...
About who?
Anne Lively...
And replace them with new ones.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Why?
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
Oh, yes.
Baltimore. Eastside. Solomon P. Eddie M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
How do I find the --
Here --
I can't even stand up --
Yes, sir. I'm Gideon. The music relaxes the prisoners.
Kill type?
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
... Graveyard shift.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Try again.
Just tell me about the intended victim. This Anne Lively...
Lara --
Don't worry, Lamar.
The nation votes this week...
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Hang on, Lamar --
Don't apologize, John.
Yes, sir.
Tuck in your shirt.
So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not. He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
In the middle of the night?
This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house. We'll talk --
I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
Beauty? The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
No doubt.
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
You're kidding, that's today?
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
I show a cop on horseback.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40's.
Run the subscription list...
No maglev system.
The mall?
Georgetown.
Now look at him...
Did he close the front door?
What?
Did Marks close the front door?!
Sir?
Go back to work. All of you.
We're in motion on something.
Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
That was easy.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Take your time.
They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.
You mind if I tag along?
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
Yes.
But it didn't fall. You caught it.
To Hineman?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Really? You've never been inside?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question. You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You gonna tell on me?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
She said...
Do I know you? Who are you?
Okay. Fine. Where the hell is that?
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
She's a precog?
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So?
So now I need you to hack into her.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
What a big boy. How old are you?
I love you, too! I love you daddy. Love ya, dad.
All right, I'll try...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
What the hell.
No. He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Sean --
I feel bad about that. I need you to forgive me.
I forgive you.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son. I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Hold your breath, Dad...
Some -- somebody's father?
His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.
NO!
No.
The precogs were wrong.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Who said I would?
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Tell me!
You're not gonna kill me...
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
The what?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
And how would I know that?
I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the precogs...
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?
I believe in that system...
Do you? Really?
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
The safest place of all.
Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.
-- and then walk out.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing. I didn't kill him.
Then how did he --
No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you were retiring?
Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.
I don't know who that is.
He also said Crow was a fake.
Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Not. Now.
I'll be right there.
My God...
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Thank you. This is Burgess.
Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
None of your damn business.
What?
Wait, just a second...
Not quite.
This murder is happening at two different times.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Yes.
What?
Uh-huh. Okay. You got some images I can work with?
Right here.
Good. What I can do is set you up down in the --
Get the hell outta here. You sick bastard.
Nice to meet you. Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that. I'm taking control of the team.
What?!
Yes, I know.
They're everywhere.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
Two?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
No. He can't...
I don't know, why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
None. This was arranged.
Who?
The man across the street. I've seen him before...
How can you even tell? You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I'll reschedule. I've been working too much anyway.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure. Raincheck.
I forgot my glasses.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream. Sorry.
Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
He's not here now, is he?
Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
Yes.
It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?
To what? Trap him?
To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Shhh! They're sleeping.
Tell me how all this works.
What does he want with a precog?
Good luck.
You're Bobby, right?
Yeah.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
We have snifters
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
It's on West Broadway.
See you later.
Manhattan.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
No.
We're in Fashion.
So you're models?
Somebody's getting comfortable.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
I know.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
He's not doing it.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
I want spaghettis.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I don't know.
Mommy's not home?
No.
What time is it there?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Oh, please.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
No coke tonight. Right?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Yeah? You sure?
Go.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
With what?
Max offered to stake me.
How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.
What'd you say?
I want you to take her with you.
There's no touching.
But what about them?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.
I don't get it.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
Draw.
What's your record at?
5-5-1.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
You driving her?
Yeah.
She'll be out in a minute.
Get away from her.
Excuse --
Yeah. Where is he?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Shit.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yeah.
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
You vouch for him?
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
What is it?
You want --
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
Take a few days --
What drill?
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Bobby.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Nah.
Traveling light. I like that.
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Depends what night.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah?
Understand me?
Yeah.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I'm on the phone.
It's important.
So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
I be off in a minute. Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Can you check?
He's not here.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
Thanks.
What about boxing?
What about it?
What are you saying?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
It's not losing record.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Yeah. I know the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
Bye.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Fuck them.
Shhh...
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there?
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
To keep?
Pretty nice.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
No. Look. There.
You sure?
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Well, I don't want to walk.
Fuck...
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you...
Don't even start.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
What did I 'get?'
Yeah. What vibe?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
You would think.
So we're working?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck this.
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
She was jonesing for me.
He wants to see us now.
Where?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
We're not getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
C'mon, man...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm your soldier.
The what?
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Easy...
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Kinda. Yeah.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
S'up.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Cool.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Ugh...
How much is what?
The videos.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes. Would you care for another one?
Yes.
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
'Strapped?'
It means you got a gun?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here...
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Word.
Soho Grand, right?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
You'll love it.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Different.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Four fernet.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Thanks.
You rode?
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
And where do we bring it?
What?
What about my keys?
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Goodbye.
We're square.
Yes, sir.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
Scotland.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I am.
A rose by any other name would --
Who's up for a night on the town.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Where I come from. Boston.
Man's rep travels.
How 'bout that?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I like you, country.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Lemme write it down for you.
Yes, sir.
Why?
When?
Just now.
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
Solid, daddy.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
I'm working on it.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
Nnnnnnn!
Bet you are.
I'll take your goddam bet.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
The bitch was there.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
There's two guns on you.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
Now.
That really you, Red?
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
What do you do with your time?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
What the hell for, man?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Who are you?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Tell Him that.
I don't know how.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Come, sit with us.
No, Brother Minister.
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
She ate.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Delicious.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Just an idle question.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
How old are you, Betty?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
I know.
At a gas station. Will you marry me?
Yes.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes. Did you eat?
I love you.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
Because you're in trouble.
How do you know?
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
The talk is everywhere!
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
We need you too!
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Shhh!
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
What did I tell you about assuming?
Is my family here yet?
Down front as always.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
I don't think we know for certain.
That's right.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Then we don't know that God was white.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Let me do it then.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
What?
"His greatest greatness."
Say what you're saying.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
I say a lot of things.
And like a fool I believe it.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
With him?
If she got eyes, she do.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
I do know I love you.
Murder.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Did you hear me?!
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
500.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Please make way, please --
How long has this been going on?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
And don't come back.
...That isn't a whore?
C'mere.
You hear me, girl?
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Fine as May wine.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Eat lead, coppers.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
I ain't doing bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Tell him about Baldy.
You the man!
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
What can you do?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
He's bright.
They talked about me like
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
I'm not... easy.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
[I have a friend there.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
So where do we begin?
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I have connections.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Deal.
Where?
[Si.]
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[What is his name?]
[Daniel.]
[Daniel what?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Who are you?]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Ordered by who?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I want you.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[What do you mean?]
[Her life for your life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[Correct!]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[Lucky how?]
[And I had my men ready.]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Yes.
Show me, please.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
How does it affect you?
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
What do you mean, I'm here?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Nothing wrong.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Pinta...
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Who's Emilio?
Creasy...
The United States.
I know. But which state?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
I'm a bargain.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
That's right.
No.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Oh...
I'm not crying.
I go to school, don't I?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
No.
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Where?
Everywhere!
My ankle.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Yes.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
You feel sorry for the husband?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
Don't worry. You will.
Yes.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
No.
Did you used to?
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
You were never late before, I was worried.
I dropped her at home.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Your father has business.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Frank. Frankie.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Then be trained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Be a swimmer.
Dyslexic?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
You're American.
So are you.
Never.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
No.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Because... I was already dead.
Planned what?
Then don't come.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Do you know what she told me last night?
For an American she understands this country very well.
She understands men.
[Yes.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[No. Why?]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
I'm trying, mom.
When?
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'...
Don't forget your towel.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Hmm?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
What? Who?
Creasy.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
That's ridiculous.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
What?
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Where?
Down there. That little one there.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
You want me to ride down with you?
What for?
It's early.
It must be one o'clock.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Where you going?
We just talked.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
She wasn't so bad.
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You told me.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What happen?
She gave me the evil eye.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
I know it pains.
Marty.
Your son Marty?
Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm thirty-four.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Thank you.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
No...
Please...
Marty...
Nothing.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Goodnight.
No, I'm not kidding.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Where you going now?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
I'll see you around.
I'll see you.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Sure. This girl said...
You gotta good heart.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Marty...
Ma! Leave me alone!
Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
Sure.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Ang'...
...and they sit down right next to me...
You want a beer, Ang'?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
What nurses?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Sure.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
Right.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas.
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure, sure.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Okay.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
You talked to Walt?
He's parted his moorings.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
They give you copies to burn.
Never this close.
How you, Radar?
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No. Or why you should.
Pour one for Painless.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Look at that right eye.
Epidural hematoma?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Not enough to be a pro.
There's only one way.
Or her figger.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
What the hell's going on here?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Wisconsin.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
I got some.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
We been had.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
What's that?
The chest-cutter.
Yeah, that's right. You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy. You're a witness.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
People will talk.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
It's supper time. But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Don't stop now! Please...
I can't... couldn't.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
What?
You betcher ass, General.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
I found a doner.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight? I guess I owe you an apology.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't get it.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
They're coming.
He can move in here with us.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That's right. We work well together.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
Hang in there.
No trouble at all. Hawkeye.
How did you get called that?
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Same here.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Maria...
You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship. Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Second pint.
Duke...
I didn't have much choice.
You really say the cutest things.
Yeah!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Thanks.
Glad to help.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
No, never in the slightest.
Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
That. It's out of the act.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
If you mean... She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
We don't want any more than that. Right now.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, sir?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Yes, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
I can try, sir.
Damn.
And another one, but it's from the south. There.
What's that, Henry?
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Good morning.
Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Now?
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Boys, we're home free.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Who?
John Doe. The one in there.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Oh. Yeah.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Uh-huh . . .
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
No.
About me?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yeah, that's the one.
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
You didn't?
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Yes, sir.
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
A hundred dollars!
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Yes, sir.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters.
The Websters!
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
Oh!
We'll get a handwriting expert to What!
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
Sorry.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I wish he had a family, though.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh.
Right here. Sit down.
Yes. What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh!
Take it easy, John Doe.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
That's
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Has he been here?
No.
Have you seen him?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Where's Connell?
He's watching the other door.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
What do you do when you work?
I used to pitch.
Baseball?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Where'd you play?
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Shut up!
Beany!
What?
Look!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Both of 'em?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
. . . Tubby?
Naw.
The heelots!
Who?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A what?
A gag. A gag!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Sure, you are.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeh.
John Doe Club?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
You betcha.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
I want it as soon as possible.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Huh? Get what?
How?
No, I didn't.
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
Did you write itor didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but
Thanks.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Flowers.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
She isn't?
Did you want to see her about something important?
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
What do you mean, too bad?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
How?
Yeah.
Hold him. Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I didn't see anything.
No, sir.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
SWAT wants to go in.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Not that we know of.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
Yeah, okay.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I'll take half of your action.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Of course.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Clarence Teal.
What happened, Mike.
You don't want to know.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
You can't help me, man.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
They want Walter dead!
Huh?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Is that where you're family lives?
I need to get something straight first.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You're gettin' the car.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Automatic.
You got it.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Is there a problem?
I what?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
Earl.
I have to go face to face.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Being faxed over now.
Yep.
For now that's all.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Spread it out.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
If you say so.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
Try to remember that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I'm not sure.
We could fill it with water.
Not the ones I'm at.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
I don't gamble.
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
No, no, no... She's from Hoboken.
Every couple of months, huh?
Do you really?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
It'll come. Try again.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
Why?
To save lives.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Okay, stop.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I do.
Fine.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Yeah, first and second.
The jockey!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
We won.
How much you wanna bet?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
Damnit!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
Pull up alongside.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
That's a chance I gotta take.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Stay put.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Let me show you something, Ray.
My name's Scott Roper.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Greg.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
Can I come in?
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
Ronnie...
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie...
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
Just now.
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
And you think he'll...
Use your imagination.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Scottie...
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
I've been thinking.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Yeah.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
Prude.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Define concern.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I'll provide you with transportation.
I want to be put on this case.
Roper...
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you want?
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes.
They have nothing to do with this --
-- Two million people lost in the digital night. What do they seek?
Yes, I believe he has --
-- You've made your point! You've got control of the system.
True.
You're in there. Everybody dies, you go with them --
-- But don't you remember? I'm already dead.
Okay...
It's all been transferred.
To live forever.
No, she said she had a son. In a dream she once called life.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Why --
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
This is how you pick up women --
-- No.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
No...
Yes.
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
That's the grace of this world. Nothing's impossible.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
From the dream.
True. But why?
Then what?
Not my problem.
So wrong --
Yes.
You are not a God.
In here I am.
In a computer program.
The new world.
It's not real.
Not real?
Yes...
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Dream?!
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me? Of course not. That's why you're here.
Yes.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
And down here --
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
-- He will.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
At least a day.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
New York.
I'm South Dakota.
The weather.
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
There is no --
Take care? Where the hell are you going --
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
-- He won't.
-- Yes.
Go!
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Christoph changed the maze.
What?
The truth.
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
A hotel?
It's not used for anything.
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Good question.
Listen to yourself. Digitization. You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
-- Who did he digitize?!
The truth.
Not his style.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Where?
Times Square.
Insurance.
Insurance?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
Tanner.
No.
No.
Then how do you know about --
-- You told me.
What are you talking about?
Who are you?!
-- The inside?
Night City.
That's not possible. No one can do that.
Corporation can.
Yes.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
For what?
Realize?
You weren't real.
Yes.
Way you kiss me.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you. A copy.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
There was no other choice.
This. No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
Try me.
There?
My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.
Just like that?
Just like that --
Activated.
Program name?
Resurrection.
Describe program function.
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.

Speed?
Wait a second... What time is it?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
What?!
Zordon... he's gone.
They're called squirbs.
It will not harm you.
Now tell me... what do you see?
Stylin'!
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
I've never been this sore in my life.
There should be a way to open it.
I've got it! We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.
What does that mean?!
Everybody hold on tight. We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
About twenty seconds in your time.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
We can take these guys!
Release the power with the power.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Ryan's Comet!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the swallow. Be the swallow...
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
... A falcon?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Did I say anything?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED. NOW GET OFF ME!
Quack like a'duck!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
GO IVAN!!
What do you mean "basically"?
How'd you know?
Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
How dare you?! Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
GO POWER RANGERS!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
Strength in numbers!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
And I ain't no nigger either!
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
But I've never served a day.
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Charlie Luciano.
The goddamned bastards.
Tell me about it.
Poor, yeah.
But not you.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Boo-Boo.
Not another word.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Whatever you say, Boss.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
You scare me, Charlie.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should I be?
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
If we have to.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
He was around...
Which is why he doesn't need us.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Long as Charlie says.
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
That's it.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
I'm already late.
For what?
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.
London?
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
It always is.
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
No. We ain't even...
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Might as well put the time to use.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
I told you twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Who?
Tommy Reina.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
They don't give a shit about us!
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Didn't know you felt that way.
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not if they all die at once.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Not stupid. Fat.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
I must know more of you, my son.
Not a lot ta know.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
I'll take care of the Boss.
I don't fuck my partners.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
You disrespect our tradition.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
I turned him down flat.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Okay. I'm listening.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
The Big Picture.
And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Come on. Be polite.
Jesus.
Hell. It's been four days!
Fuck 'em.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Luciano is dead?
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Now that's a hard number.
Just wanted ta say hello.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
This is nice. I mean it.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
What?
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Five CC's.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Sad commentary, huh?
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Bend over?
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Less.
Why?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Tell me what?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Monkeybone...!?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
I need a new PR guy.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
He called me "Doc."
Who?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
I'd better go report this...
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
When'd you get in?
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
<u>What</u> union?
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened? Did you lose your keys?
Have a nice day.
And you don't deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You don't like where I live?
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
Dating anyone?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
What pictures?
You know ... ... whoops!
Mother!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Behind the books.
But I was dusting.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I'm sorry.
Mm hmm.
I can make my own decisions.
Well, bye. And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
It's Marika. Is Paula there?
She's at work. I'm her mother.
Oh. I thought today was Saturday.
Oh. You need a cappuccino.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
What happened?
Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward.
He's an organic farmer.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
What do you think? I left it on the curb?
And where is she?
Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ...
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from?
Moscow.
Ohhh. Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day.
This way?
Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It's still day.
Forty-five all total.
Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen. What's this?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell. Thanks very much. Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
Never.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Yes, sir. All right, boys--let's go.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Blow a bugle!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up-- --*five more minutes*!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
What's this, Diz?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Huh?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
What! Who?
You know--little worms--ambition.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly. Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Who?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Yes. Mostly "Puss." Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
"There's more light here," he says--
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
My friends?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Waiter!
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
I apologize.
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Susan? Nah!
Right now--everything I own--!
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
Take me home, Diz.
He's a house-afire!
That infernal phone!
Yes, yes--phone, phone-- A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this-- Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Great saints!
Taylor, my dear.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Nonsense.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All right, why?
Yes, Jim.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Horace Mill--!
Henry Hill.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
*You won't?*
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Oh--Jim!
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Aw--
The--head?
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Is *what* getting me down?
Oh, a *boy*!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Himself!
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Look! There it is!
What? Who?
You have? Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
For a question!
I yield.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Here--where are you running off to?
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Gosh! Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Mr. President--
No, Jeff--please--!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but-- --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Now, now, now! It's all right, Governor.
What?
Hello, Ma. Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
We'd better see.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
You're a liar!
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
No!
J-Jefferson Smith.
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
No. What had you better--?
You *couldn't*?
Punch?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
And with your help--
A *day*!
Tonight.
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
What?
The Steering Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
We're over in the House.
Pardon?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Thanks very much.
And a *lot* of paper!
I did--and--and I got right up.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Yes, yes--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No complaints.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Have I?
Saunders. That's better. Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Terrible, thank you.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
I know. It's--Violet.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh. Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
In Terry Canyon?
You--don't know it, do you?
No--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Great.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Not another bill?
Oh--*Saunders*!
Don't mention it--
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
Saunders--
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
What you *have* to do is fight!
But--I've done everything I--
Hurray!
Where do we go from here?
To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Goodnight, Senator--
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Yes, sir--
How's that, buddy?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What! Who?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
What's the matter?
Let's get away from here.
That's dynamite, Joe!
I know that.
Susan!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Nice *compliment*!
What do you mean?
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Do you?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
No--I--I'll take a walk--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order! Will Senator Smith yield to--?
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
Who are you?
Some people like it.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes, I
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Sometimes twice.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes he whistles.
And sings.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, you own it.
Always.
Uh-huh.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
Next, please.
No.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.
Why not?
Would you like to go for a walk?
No!
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
I enjoy it.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, let's.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
Nothing
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
You have?
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Sure!
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
It had better be good.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I'll get my hat.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Thank you.
All right.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
Yes, here we are again. Good night.
Mary - I - excuse me
Yes, of course.
Oh, hello darling.
Nothing.
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Yeah, then what?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Huh?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
We're not going out tonight.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
Sure.
With pay! She is out the door.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Last night he proposed to me.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yes.
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Right.
Hurry up!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
Boy, was he burning.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Come on - let's go!
John
Close that door. Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes, sir.
Me sir?
Yes.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Let me go!
Better wire him right away, John.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
This is outrageous!
What was that you said he was?
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
But your honor
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Hang up.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
You can't?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
What?
That tuba player!
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
Mandrake Falls. M-A-N
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it. And, Charlie
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Okay.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
All right.
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Who - me? No.
You're going to New York with us.
When?
No, thank you.
No?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
I've got one for Cobb
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Are those stories true?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
I'm Chairman.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
We own an opera house, don't we?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Me?!
Naturally.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Ja.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh. That.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I play the tuba.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Take the stand!
Thank you, Your Honor.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
I don't know.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Oh. Oh!
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I did what!
What two policemen?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
But she's on the telephone
Get out. The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What, sir?
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Yes, sir.
No! What do you want!!
Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
Really? You think so?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Uh-huh. What are they?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
What happened?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Could you come with me please?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Were you supposed to have a session?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
Ernest, what do you think?
I think he's got a point.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Right now?
Are we?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
My approach?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Good, then go.
Mr. Follett.
Stop now.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
No?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
I never said that.
Go to hell.
I didn't hear you.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
But you did come to me.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Nope.
I've had my moments.
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
A little.
She seems very unhappy.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Oh?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
What are they?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
It was Henry Follett.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, I don't know...
You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Doc. Ainge...
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
You're on your own today, honey.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
Lily.
Doc.
He told you.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Sure.
Got a license? But no car?
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Got to.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Did you straighten her out?
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better. Let's go, Vanessa.
Mumford... like the town?
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Mother... go away!
Oh... not a real doctor.
That's right, the fake kind.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What?
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll work it out.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Maybe you'll catch it.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Something's bothering her.
What?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
No.
Really? What would it take?
Sorry... I'm done.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Be specific.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Where?
Life.
Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Disgusting.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And he's where?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
That's one way to put it.
Yeah?
Of course.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
Transference!
Transference.
Hello.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You probably got the idea.
You're not the only one...
But...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Anything... just ask.
What is your name?
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
It's called pro bono.
Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.
Have women found you attractive?
What do you want me to see?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
Uh-huh.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
No again?
How are you?
Nah... scotch.
Far out. Single malt? Can I pick it?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I've got three big ones.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Unbelievable... ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
This --
Yeah. Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
You don't think I'm insane?
And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret?
Really?
Definitely.
It's not?
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
It matters to me.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
That'd be Lily.
How'd you do it? The new you.
All new people start with that...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
Psych major?
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
See you Thursday... regular time.
I'm honored.
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
What'd I do?
Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
What?
When?
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Well, okay then.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
Excuse me?
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
In the desert? What for?
None of the above, thank you.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
I've had worse.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Why do you like to fight so much?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Do you know where I can steal some?
What friend? You're my only friend.
You shall see.
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh yes, always.
Intestines.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Correct, And that's when --
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
What did you do to him!?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
I would never!
Fifty percent.
Twenty.
Forty.
What are you doing here?
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Broad?!
No?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well... I know my brother.
You swear?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
Want to know?
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
I know my treasure.
Oh that's comforting.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Trust me.
Are you sure?
We're about to be shown the way.
The things that get you excited.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Who was talking about what?
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
No, we are not.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
It's everybody's problem!
FINE.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I think you were jealous
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got what?
I have no choice.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Yes?
I think you found something.
I was mistaken.
You lied to me!
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Picked his pocket, actually.
Way to go, Evy.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Still...
Did you ever see him eat?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
What's it look like!?
Yes,... I see.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Awfully.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Got it.
You have got to be joking?
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Of course.
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What --?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
Really?
The Disco Boys.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
When was that?
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
I'm the Bowler.
He was cute though.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Me, too.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
I dunno.
Hello?
Sure.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
Have you considered my offer?
What about Captain Amazing?
Should I kill them?
Why bother?
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Captain who?
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
You're dead.
So are you!
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Terrific.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Why not?
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
You're a spy.
What?
I saw him walk you home.
Who?
Roy.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight.
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Yeah.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Sure.
That was easy.
Why?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
It is?
Who wouldn't?
What's your real name?
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
Yeah.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
You don't seem very angry right now.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Bye.
Monica!
Yes.
Yes.
I just know.
Good or evil, what's the difference?
And you are a fool.
And a skunk stinks!
When are you going to take off that mask?
When I am sure I am among friends.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
LOOK!
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Good point.
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But there's still only six of us.
SO WHAT?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
With what?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
So why don't you just tell her!
I can't.
Why not?
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Who's chicken?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Wait!... Look!
Shhh.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.
Ow.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Oh hi, Mom.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
It is?
I always knew that you were special.
You did?
Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Definitely.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or Batman --
Or both.
Sorry.
Be a Mohican.
Shut up.
The who?
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
The bazookas?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But how do we get in?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's suicide.
Great timing!
With or without him, we gotta go!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Right.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I did, sir.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Please...
May I come to the map?
No, thank you.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Are you serious?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
About 5,000 troops.
Cavalry?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
You realize what is at stake?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know, sire.
And where is Joseph?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Bertrand, sire.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Yes, sire?
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
No, sir, none at all.
You may go, Captain Charles.
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
Have you been back recently?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
No, they're living in Nice now.
That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah-hh, no.
I thought not. I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Four o'clock.
My God, what a fire!
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Our troops have no part in this. It has been started by the Russians!
Oh?
What is that?
Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?
I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?
I have met her. What is your business with me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Does your mother know you have come?
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I see.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
I'll have the fire built up.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, I am, sir.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
That's a very nice name. Where are you from?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Oh, yes... of course.
Junot?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You must not act impetuously.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
When is she supposed to return?
Only as a last resort. What are the Councils doing now?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
I thought I was. I was confused.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Yes.
No.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Of course.
Were you in love with any of them?
No.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
I will never forgive you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
I don't understand you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
You are my old friend.
Open the door. It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
What are you doing in there?
I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
Yes.
But you will not... be safe...
Not be safe? What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment.
Why did you give it to him?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
Nothing. That's all I can say.
That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
That's all I can say.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course. What do you want?
I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Yes, he has.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Let me have it.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Send him in.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up.
That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Naw, it ain't like that.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Well, let me in.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Good.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I don't know!
Suga!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Yup.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
No we didn't. We came to buy a CD.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Can I look for myself?
Ain't the rest room this way? I gotta pee.
I'll do it.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
I'm gone.
Not me.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
Black magic.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
What about the dog?
Cheeco.
I said shut up! Now who sent you?
Nobody!
If you say another word, it's over. I'm not playing!
You. Hi, Uncle Willie.
Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.

To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
I don't know.
What you mean, you don't know? Just wait here.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning. They're assholes.
It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys.
I just wanted to give you this.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
Yes I did. Excuse me.
Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation.
It's locked.
Make sure.
So what? Let's make'em wait.
Okay.

Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Yeah, it was. How you get up here?

Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Don't worry about it, man. Get the phone.

Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I didn't even pass it.

R-U-S-H Intensely.
You could sell your Beamer.
Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I know.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I'm not letting nothing go. They killed my board.
Let it go!
Butterflies, my ass. I'm about to go home.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
This is a knock.
Ya'll live around here?
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Okay, later, bro. Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.

Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes.
I got fired too.

Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
Nothing.
What?! This look like a 7-11 or something? Get the fuck outta here!
Alright, no problem. We gone.
Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shut up! Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Yeah.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on!
I don't know the number.
Keep pushing.
What?
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I don't know.
Huh?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
I'll take you later.
When? After you get all drunk and loaded?
Nothing. What you want?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.
'Take your car?'
Yeah, and hurry up.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact. Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Elroy.
Suga. Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Okay. Bye, Craig.
What you doing to my nephew?
Ah, baby...I thought this was you. Craig, what are you doing to me?
Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl.
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
For what? We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
It's an important speech.
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
That's my girl.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Business.
San Diego.
'S okay. What do you think?
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Aw, too bad.
What?
The grave. Somebody close?
Oh, yeah?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I...
Yes?
Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
Ah.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
No.
Who did?
And your husband works for somebody else.
What the hell are you saying?
Indeed.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Believe me, I don't blame you. This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Same to you.
What?
Yes.
I'd like to know what...
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
You wouldn't...
Good.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
The gun...
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You...
Then I have time for a drink.
Me?
Tell me why I miss him.
He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.
You fucked up.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
No, please...
That's right. That gives you...
Let me talk to her again.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No, that's,..that's fine
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Okay...
I think you're right.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
We made it.
On TV.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
No way.
How did you see us kiss?
Nods.
Let' s do it.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
To be a hero?
I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
No, kisses to...
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
Please. Something is going to happen...
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
That's right.
Kill the Governor.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Don't think I won't.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Thank you.
You're going to go see her.
What!?
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
Thanks for the tip.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
I don't think so.
I think this is worth a dollar.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Gimme a dollar.
Fuck you!
What?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Could I see it?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Laughs.
It goes in that little hole.
I've done much better ones than this.
You have, huh?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
That's good. That's good, sweetie pie.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Yeah.
It doesn't look like it.
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
It's time. It's time now.
Nah. Hates his wife.
What about them?
Where?
Right there.
Young love.
Come with me, honey.
I kill her anyway.
Only you.
You're wasting time.
'Daddy has to go now.
Do it!
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Just put her on.
No.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He carried on some; kicked.
No.
What do you figure he done with it?
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
What'd I say? What? What? What? What?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
I'll bet.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Dad, you're bleeding...
You understand?
Not even her?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
And I won't never tell about the money.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
I been mindin' Pearl.
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
No.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't!
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mother, I only --
Sshhh! He's in there.
Mr. Powell! Willa has run away!
I'll be switched!...
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Bluebeard!
Twenty-five wives!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Come on!
Tricked us!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
Fiddlesticks!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
There's something else.
What?
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
It's a shame!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Mister Powell!
Satan.
Ah.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The devil wins sometimes!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Blue men.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
'Cause you're too little.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sshhh...
Hm?
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
John! Don't!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
You what?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John, where are we g --
Hush.
That's Daddy!
Ssh...
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it! Ruby!
Dead.
Dead.
Up river.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
He ain't my Dad.
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Huh?
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
It -- she --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
The summer is young yet, little lad. Pearl?
I'll tell.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
Yonder.
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
Come to me, boy!
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
All right.
Where's the money hid.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahh!
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
I was praying.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Harry, what --
Get up.
I -- no, I --
I'm through, Harry.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Answer me!
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
Where's she at?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
None of your business, Madam.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What you been up to?
I been out with men.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
What?
The man! The man!
No, nothing.
I sure as hell hope so.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Who was scary?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina?
Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.
Slept like a rock.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Uh-oh...
Okay, okay. I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Used to. Not anymore.
No.
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Great.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Well what you reading it for?
Hi.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
The killer.
You do?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
My dream.
How you plan to do that?
What!?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Okay. Hi, dad.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
He's dangerous.
You don't know he did it.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
You know he's dead though, right?
Nan, I --
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! Hey! We got a fire!
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
She lived there.
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
'Anything funny' like what?
Krueger.
Krueger?
How you know that?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
School.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after. See you.
I won't.
Get into bed.
I will.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Mother, for petesakes.
Great
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Right.
Nancy?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Okay.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Put that damned thing down!
Nancy!
S'curity.
Dead and gone.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
We should get her out of here...
He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
You were screaming like crazy.
The door was locked from your side.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
No.
He's nuts about you.
Yeah, nuts.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Of course. What's that?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
Naturally, Comrade.
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
What are you serving?
An omelet.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
You should. I'll show you.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
Positively not!
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Or we can't go back to Russia!
That's another thing... it's spring.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises...
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
What is it?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
No, no.
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
With two f's, if you please.
That's right.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
But, Comrades...
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
The former Duchess!
Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I am, Gaston.
Yes, General Savitzky?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Yes.
Count d'Algout...
That's perfect!
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
While you eat, you look at the view.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But you can't...
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.
Razinin.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I'll send you a muff.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A cow?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Look for yourselves.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Monsieur.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Even the swallows are back.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Au revoir.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Business.
What business?
Private.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
At what intervals does he whistle?
What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
No.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Suppress it.
I'll try.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Yes, very strange.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go? You might be an interesting subject of study.
I will do my best.
Yes.
Good evening, comrade. This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Thank you. Thank you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
You repeat yourself.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's twelve o'clock.
It's false sentimentality.
No, that was restful. Again.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
The telephone is ringing.
Oh, let it ring.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
You know I want to...
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
Then you should go back to your table.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I have never heard one.
No.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
What, darling?
Thursday.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
All right.
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Who cried that one?
It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Please.
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Did you win?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Oh, yes.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Huh?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
That bad? Old or young?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
How do you do?
No thanks, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Yes.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello.
What?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
I must ask you to leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
In that case I can only say good-by.
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
Why?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
Yes, it does.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
No.
Yes... leaving immediately.
I will do my best.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
The future of the common people.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
My jewels?!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Never. I never said that about Jews!
You don't need to check the tape. I know what I said.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
He's nervous, sir. He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms. He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino.
Then what about this Washington Post crap? Woodwind and Fernstein?
Son of a bitch.
What?
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Uh huh ...
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Yes ... I got the money.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I'll bet he would.
Is it?
To protect his people.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time.
You do it.
Why me?
'Cause he hates you. It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
How so?
You think this is just about politics?
I figured that out.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Yeah?
No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
He wants money.
Pay him.
No, sir.
Why not?
I thought the gloves were off.
Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
... go on.
I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
There's no secrets here, Al.
'Night, Al.
For what?!
Cox! Fire him.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Can we get around this, Al?
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
That's right ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Sir?
That fruitcake! What about him?
I did?
We were working on China.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Silence!
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
He'll need a pretext. He'll never figure one out for himself.
How is this national security?
Sir?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.
No!
What? That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
You never told him?
Sir?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.
Run 'em over.
What?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry. It's killing us with the rednecks.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
Right. They don't trust! They don't trust America!
We could leverage Helms.
How?
When I met with him, he said ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Townsend gave us 300 grand. Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
No ...
Why me?
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?
I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit.
What ... ?
Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
Harold ... can I get you anything?
And so shall I. Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
Yes ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
No.
Edgar, think twice. He works in the kitchen.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
How about you? Are you going to win?
You should ask Bobby.
Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.
I never met the man.
I know you've been very careful not to. That's why I'm concerned.
We took his system out.
Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Injections. Even this noble sport's been fixed. Seen the guys?
They're around.
The White House.
You're fucking me.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank. We're gonna plug a leak.
Who we working for?
A guy named Gordon Liddy. Thinks he's Martin Borman. You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
We'll see about that.
Her name's Sandy ...
Presidents don't threaten. They don't have to. Good day, gentlemen.
I beg your pardon --
But they all got it back again, didn't they? We should have lunch sometime.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Idiotic? Yes, I suppose it was.
Yeah ...
Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
What a waste of time. My writings mean absolutely nothing.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we. Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
You don't think he was a hero?
Did you cry when he died?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know. He made me see the stars ...
Looks can be deceiving ...
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
I was the lesser of two evils.
The real war is in us. History is a symptom of our disease.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
Free, if you're the president.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
It broke my heart when Harold died.
That was a long time ago.
... but it was all we had.
Mr. Nixon.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Use his women.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
Hello ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Maybe I am.
And we got the "big mo"! We're back!
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Sir?
That's right.
POWs. And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate. Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
I know ...
It's hard to lose ...
What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Amen to that.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that. Us.
I want a divorce.
My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
No, I'm not! I'm finished.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
I'll never run again. I promise.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they? New Hampshire ...
I don't want them to love me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This. Above all.
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Anything.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
You personally?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
When?
Tomorrow.
You. What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew. You're hiding.
Hiding what?
Thank you.
Thank you? Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
No. They're not yours. They are you. You should burn them.
Hi, Happy. Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
To what?
What?
The "crises"?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Whatcha mean by that?
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Some say you are, Rocky.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard it?
How's that?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Yes I do.
Nineteen zero and nine.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
No ID in her room?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Try "old" on for size.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Uh-huh.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Well what would you call him.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
He's real all right.
Oh yes.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
He won't neither. He never has.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
That's the boy.
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Mm.
I don't know...
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Well I don't either!
No sir.
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Hyah!
That's very nice.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
What do you think.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
No.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
To your husband.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
What're you goin' to do?
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Well -- how come?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Llewelyn --
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Promise?
Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Uh-huh.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
You should be used to that.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
I shall return.
Hey.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did you tell him?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know something better.
What's that.
I know where it's going to be.
And where is that.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Screwgie.
In the truck. I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
All right...
No me mate.
You from around here?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
You know who it is.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
All right.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what're you goin' up there for.
No. Do you?
Yes.
Nobody. Accounting.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
I see.
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
With anything?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Generally around dark. At dark.
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Sir?
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
Yes I do.
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Everything.
How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
All right. Heads then.
Sir?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
...Where you want me to put it?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
Okay.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
No sir, it's unusual.
What room?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
It's all right.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
November the 28th, last year.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Yes?
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The what?
The option.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
That's got two double beds.
I got beers in my room.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
To kill your wife.
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I don't know.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Nam?
Yes sir. Two tours.
What outfit.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...I meant your food.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
...plenty
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Oww! My arm, careful!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasn't a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
You think a woman did that?!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Yeah?
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You're lying!
We think we know where Betty is.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Tell him what you told me.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
No, I didn't have to.
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess... How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
This is really awkward...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
What?
The LeSabre!
Maroon. I stole it.
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Well, you are.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
We were engaged.
No, Del.
You never gave us a chance...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
What happened when you were twelve?
Didn't I?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Ad lib?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
David, please --
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
I have... did it sound that bad?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
George...
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
What?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
They're new to us...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
That is a skill!
I came for love...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Uh-huh.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
I'd slap his face.
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Los Angeles, California.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Really?
No. Loma Vista.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
I'll go to the Hospital.
Worse.
You made out alright.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
I married a car salesman.
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fianc is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I was talking about what you could wear!
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
ON TELEVISION!! Cut the shit, will you!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
...okay.
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, almost never.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't think so. Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Good.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Of what?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
No...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Like what?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
...and put them in your mouth.
Beer, please.
Wesley... Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
You told me how to do it!
That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
What 'look'?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
No.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
What doesn't?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
...yeah, I got it. Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You made your point... I was wrong.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
"Injuns?"
She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.
Hmm?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
...yeah.
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
No! Let me try this!
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
Better.
Oh fuck...
Sure.
Would you say she was ambitious?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
David Ravell.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
"A Reason to Love."
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Waitaminute -

Where's Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Not that I'm aware.
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Everett, my beard itches.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

Now Penny, stop that!
We ain't gettin' married with his ring! You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
No weddin'.
That's right, honey.
That's good, honey.

That's not my ring.
Not your...
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You said -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
It was in his bureau.
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
That don't make no sense!
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Million point two.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Isn't it, uh...

Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you. C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Neither have you, pard!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Naw. That's over with.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest.
Come over here where I can see you.
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
I don't mean anything by it.
No, sir!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
Yes, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
Yes, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I know.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Zack, don't!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Yeah.
We don't have to talk at all.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Or we could do that yeah.
Then, I'll see you around.
I'm a little late, that's all.
How late?
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
You what?
What?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
Great.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Yeah... Mmmm...
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Everything was different.
But in what ways?
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No way... Would you?
I do.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
No! That's not true!
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
That's it?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Any time, sailor.
It sure was.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
When I'm good and ready.
Are those for me?
No, they're for your mom.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
Twenty-two years ago.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I don't know where that is.
Why?
Because he's my friend, too.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I bet you do!
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
I can't risk it.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Yeah. All week long.
I've seen better.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Shhhh...
Sure.
Yeah.
Naw.
A little.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
No problem, but who's Susan?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But she expects you to marry her?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Not with me. Not with people.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Peace out.
She didn't.
God.
There is not one thing funny here.
Just sending a message. She'll get the point.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Who's the clown now? Huh?! Who's the fucking clown now?!
That's right.
Burning me. It's burning my eye.
I have the gun.
Yes.
Remember that.
Please...
What do you think? Get us into that room.
I can't.
I can't...
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
This is ridiculous...
Two. Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay! Okay.
You got an idea?
Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check something.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
She better.
That's their problem.
You finish. Then we finish.
The kid in here. The other two when we come out.
You know how this gotta end.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
I know.
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen business days. Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
This is insane. I'm outta here.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
So we keep an eye on her. Raoul can totally administrate that part.
What about us? What if she has a gun?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Different tables.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
Yeah. Kidnapping.
Shut up.
I did.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
Shit!
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Huh?
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
You don't look so good.
Huh?
The sentence that started "There are three." What was the rest?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Master closet.
KID! NO ELEVATOR!
Not at all.
A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.
Open it.
I said open the door.
Don't!
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
No cars. Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
No, Edgar Allen.
The furniture guy?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
Open the door.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
478-0150.
The crowd goes wild.
478...
0150.
Don't.
Fuck her too.
People. In the house.
That room!
What?!
PANIC ROOM!
It doesn't work?!
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
What do they want?
I don't know. Rob us. I don't know.
Wait.
What if they get in here?
They can't. They can't get in here. No. They can't.
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility.
Fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Get the fuck out of my house!
Give me a break.
Little bit. Yeah.
Don't though.
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm here. I'm here.
On the floor! Get on the floor!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
"Titanic."
Come on, come on...
Shhh...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom. Do it!
No.
Close it!
I saw something, I saw...
Blue is phones?
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble. He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you...
What?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Not an option.
What if I do?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I'm okay... listen to me... Let's go with Judge, check it out.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Damn straight... Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You know it brother.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
What's up?
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Yeah.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
What's with you?
Get out of the fucking car.
Yeah, it's me.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Damn straight.
No Fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Party needs the bread. Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
No man. PE -- "political education."
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
You got it. Berkeley?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
No sir he didn't.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
You mean...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this. Brother we got momentum!
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
So talk...
Alone...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Wait a second there brother...
Yeah.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
So what's the deal?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
I'm down.
Right on Brother Judge...
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Well, act like it. Come on.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
What you see is what you got. That's' Bobby Seale.
Fuck maybe... be there.
Just the legit shit.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Nothing.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know. But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
What?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I don't know. I really don't.
It's alright. I'm very happy for you.
Good.
Late summer.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Uh... uh... I...
It's a start.
That would be nice.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
Pride will do.
No, he takes after his mother...
You got me beat on both accounts.
The hell I do.
He's not making light.
He's my father.
Oh, right. Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Thank you.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
You couldn't have known.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Lovely.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Who cared for your wounds?
With a lace table cloth?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
As you wish.
Oh?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
That is a separate issue.
I consider them linked.
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
Most certainly. Arrange it.
Perhaps.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Probably.
How can we end this madness?
Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
I understand, sir.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Thank you. How's the spotted one's milk?
The middle colonies?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.
And the Governor?
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Yes.
Not yet. What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
It's already over.
We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
It's safer if we stay together.
Yes, sir. My father taught me.
He tried. It didn't take.
Yes... ... father.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Father?
Pride is his weakness.
We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
What?
Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.
Granted. Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Is it her? Is Anne in there?
She is. Don't go in there.
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
And what do they know?
That's not enough. Tell me.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Yes.
He left us.
I don't care. I hate him.
You don't hate him.
Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Please.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
It's Mister Marion.
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
Thirteen years...
That's a damn long time...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Balderdash!
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Name five hundred.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
That's five, keep going...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
You said bribery twice...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
We saw.
I am, I think.
What are my orders?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Long time.
Not held, just slowed down.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
How many men have we seen die?
Two. Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
I hope so.
Robert. Robert E. Lee.
Thank you.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Yes... you will wait.
Four, five miles.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here.
Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.
I heard about your son. I'm sorry.
For what?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Don't depend on my decency. I'm one of that sort.
About a hundred and twenty. Less than a third.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Worse.
Proud, priggish and competent. A very bad combination in an adversary.
When?
But father, they might come this way.
Put them away.
Thank you. Did you finish the upper field?
Six-pounders. Lots of them.
Quiet.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Bite?
Ayuh.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes--
Is that right, dad?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yaay!
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Of course I will.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yaay!
Yayyy!
Well, I thought it was safe--
For a little while.
To remember.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Yes.
Because you promised.
I know.
I hate that smell.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Huh?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I swear.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Not at all.
Good for you.
Allman Brothers.
What?
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
What's at the end of it?
Sure.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Yes.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I don't know.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Then come on.
Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Is there quicksand?
Ayuh.
You're telling me.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Why? For God's sake, why?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
What did we do, Jud?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
And because the dead walked.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Remember.
You don't understand--
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I just said--
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
I got eggs down here!
Good d--
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm sure.
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together --
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back. Or one better.
I will.
Aye, aye, sir!
She. Goes. Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You can't. I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
We got that part. Anything else?
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No you won't.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Wait as long as you like.
Track you down and --
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That's fair.
All right then.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
What're you suggesting?
That so?
Men! Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
Now. No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
By the powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
No. But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.
Very well.
Elizabeth -- Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.
Thank you, sir.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Now, none of that. Please dig in.
Then why aren't you eating?
Would that I could.
It's a pirate medallion.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Boy overboard!
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Very good.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
You're speaking up for him again?
What?
I know where your heart truly lies.
That would hardly be proper.
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
No. This won't work. I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
It won't. It won't, and so we won't.
What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
More to drink!
To the Black Pearl.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Nor did you, I noticed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
And you've got that, have you?
That he is.
She can hold a bit longer.
We're catching up!
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
I know. That was for the smell.
That we are.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
This must be some important boat.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
Indeed.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Pirate.
No.
Move!
No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never. They took Miss Swann.
How? The key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
Good.
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye! Avast!
My father. William Turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Don't worry. I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
These are the only ones worth having. And we're going to need them --
Depends.
On what?
This way!
I'll lead them away.
Jack!
Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
Yes, I have.
No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
And no lies!
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Still --
Where did he come from?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
No. She hasn't.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Bleak. Very bleak.
A moment.
But --
Please.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Until he's done.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Come with me, Susan. I want to show you something.
No, thank you.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched. Poppy?
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Ain't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You're not rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She says it's not.
She's lying. She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Who cares! We've got to find him! Hurry!
Nebbleman.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives. The instant, understand?
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
That remains to be seen.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Do you think she loves him?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
No, Icky, this is real.
Icarus, please! This is important!
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Consideration?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Considering what?
What I asked you earlier?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Did I? I've been waiting for that for years.
Not that.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Thank you, sir.
Donated to science. Perfect.
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
I like Trix!
I want Trix! Mommy!
So what? So what? For starters, how about littering is a crime.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Aaabout...?
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
A man?
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
What did he want?
Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
That's right. C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
That's the guy?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Opportunity?
No! Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Who isn't?
It's Sim. We're almost there.
Mr. Sim, watch out! O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
Yes. That's it. He's got it. Oh God, he's got it!
So, I guess it worked.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright. You're just in time.
What? No kiss? Not even for old times sake?
Been out for six months now.
Really? What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house.
Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
It already is.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right. You predicted it.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
That's what I thought.
We'll see? What does that mean?
Am I? Look! Right there! That's exactly what I am talking about.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
The nanobot.
Mouse? What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
I don't know.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
I'm a plastic man! A plastic man!
We don't?
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
Why?
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
What waste?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The waste.
What happens?
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
That's right.
Isn't it already too late then?
No, no, I just feel wired!
What? What's wrong?
What about it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Blame the victim.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah. Old times.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
No problem.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's still inside me?
I don't know.
Something else I want to try.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
The head shrinker at the prison.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late. Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Yes.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
The same thing I suppose.
I have to!
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you? How about 'infantile dementia'?
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
I'm real touched. Now get your Sunday's on. We're going for a ride.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy! You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
Oh yeah?
The question is, are you?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.
And you have him?
We lost him.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
You won't. That's why you're whispering.
Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Pipe down, brain lady! And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.
Dexter.
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No? Why not?
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For what?
For the letters, of course.
I'm glad.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Of course I am Stewart.
Now let's get this settled
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Gallagher!
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Yes - isn't it?
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
I poisoned him.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Are you crazy?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Good morning. What does this mean?
Stewart!
Oh, hello Mother!
Why
Mother!
Look! Look! The front page!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
You're the Tribune man?
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
We were classmates.
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Oh yeah?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I certainly will.
I'm afraid.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Yeah?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Come on, get going, get going!
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Araby?
Sure.
Araby, my eye!
No?
No!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
You're my what?
Your valet, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Drunk, sir?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Oh no, sir!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Outside!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Thank you. Where is Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
and those and them.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well!
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
It's the smoke.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I knew you would, pal. A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Right!
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Yeah?
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Good.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Well, at best you might deny it.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
She did?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
And now for that twentieth crack
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Sure.
Hello, Joe.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
With pleasure, Madame!
Get out of here.
All right, Grandma
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Heavens! The man's insane!
I understand, sir.
Now the lady said you may go
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
Yes, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
Yes.
That's all I wanted to know!
Very good, sir.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Thanks.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah?
Sure.
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
Ah.
Yes.
Okay.
What?
Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that.
We're in Pleasantville?
It can't be possible.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
Sure.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I had to say goodbye.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Thanks ... I love you.
I love you too.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
No, no ... Come on in.
Thanks.
I think it looks nice.
Well ... Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Here's my favorite.
She's crying.
She's crying.
No she's not.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
It's alright.
No ...
I don't know.
But I really should get home.
But you can't go out there.
Yeah. It does.
Yeah. Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I was in a bowling-alley.
Sure you are.
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Um ... It's ...
Oh yeah.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Hunh? Oh, right ...
What?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
We were gonna ... You know ...
Why not?
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
What?
I don't believe it.
What's the matter?
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
But it could happen.
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
One of those ... big beds?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Rain.
Real rain?
Yes I did.
Yes I do.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Still doesn't make it right.
Very well ...
The basketball team?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Oh sure it is.
No it isn't.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What do you mean!?
Well, I never had to do it before.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
What?
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What is it?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Yes.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Green.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
The other one?
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
No way.
Get lost!
YOU get lost!
What happened?
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
What's going to happen?
I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible?
Neither do I.
Just take deep breaths.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Hunh.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
I don't think so.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What were you doing in a library?
I got lost. Oh here ... look at this!
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
Jen please ...
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Nothing.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Really? It seems so fattening.
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
... Yeah.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
That's great.
Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Wow.
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
What?
What?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Oh ... Hi.
... Lover's Lane?
Oh ... Right.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.
You don't know?
What?
Out there.
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.
Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here.
Hunh?
They just grow like that?
Rain.
Real rain?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
Sure ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
Marmalade.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.
Nice ... Nice ...
What department store did they go to?
McIntire's.
McGinty's.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ... You know ...
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
COME BACK!!!
... Hi.
Well c'mere, young fella.
What?
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh--well ...
NOW!
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Look ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh no? Let me show you something!
Why?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
I'm going to leave now.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Because you're coming home.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Much less than that. An hour and a half.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
I understand.
What?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Oh ... Okay. ... But I really liked it.
So they can have their hamburgers!
... What's that?
Christmastime.
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Open it.
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
No, that's not it.
Just a little--You know.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
Well here I am.
What's the rush?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
A miracle.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Hey.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Yeah.
Cool.
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Well, I can't talk though --
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Ok, bye-bye.
No, no, no.
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Ok. Thank you.
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Why?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
No.
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't know.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm sorry.
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Tell me why.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
No.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Are you watching a porno movie?
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Sure.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
...just talking to you....
Are your pants off?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
It doesn't matter.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
No.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Where is she?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
...yeah.....
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
No.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
You're going to work now?
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Really? Please?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
I need help.
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No you won't.
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
....this is your mistake....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
No.
They're not open yet?
They don't get opened until eight.
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
I think that'll be fine.
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok.
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Yes I do.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
It's terrible, no.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Are you guys hurt?
Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Sure.
Yeah.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
You like her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn't get along with her very well?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Ok.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you pick it up from the street?
What?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Yes no not really.
...yeah...
Yeah.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
This is Lena.
Hi.
Yeah.
So what do I do then?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
Lena?
Yeah?
It's Barry.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yes.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?
yeah.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
It's so nice.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Yeah.
This is nice.
For what?
For work.....
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
I thought that you were anyway.
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
Ok.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
It's a plastic, yeah.
For what?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok.
Ok, bye, bye.
Bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
Did you do it?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Why?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Sorry.
Hello, how are you?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Yes it is.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Can I ask how much is this?
What do you mean?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
Barry Egan.
And your Social Security number.
What's that for?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
-- and this is confidential?
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
What?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'll say whatever I want --
Yes I did.
That's that.
Thank you.
I think you have a call?
I didn't know you had a sister?
....I have seven.
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
That was weird. I meant good.
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Mhm.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
It's alright.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Yeah.
Like a psychiatrist?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
Fine, thank you.
Ok. You're connected.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi, Lance.
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Let's just leave it there for now.
...I'll tell you later.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What happened?
....I made a call..... ....and, uh....
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Yeah.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
You gotta give me some money.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Please don't do this.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
You have another house somewhere or something?
No.
I'm sorry.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
Well....what do you want, then?
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
What time are you gonna be there?
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I know.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I won't.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
That's it.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
I'm only paying two of you guys.
What's the problem?
Nothing.
Put him through.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Are you coming to eat with us?
Ok.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Ok.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Once or twice.
Then what's he doing here?
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Yes, Abbe?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Why not?
What? What've I done?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
It's not even noon --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Don't be so sure.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
And --?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You always do.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Good day, Marquis.
THEN BUGGER ME!
His rug.
Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- water! --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
A man after my own heart...
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Coulmier, you animal!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
NOW STRIP.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
Then it must've been love --
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
His wife's influence.
His wife's?
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
Well...?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Do you favor its publication?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
He's sworn to obedience.
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
Oh indeed?
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No. It most certainly was not.
What could cause a tincture like this?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
You'd suffer in her stead?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
HER NAME, ABBE.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
Poorly.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Quite.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben?
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
"Well worth the dig!"
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Don't start --
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
There's something else I want from you.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
What's that then?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
Go on, child.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
-- words alone are insufficient.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Of course.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
....shame on you, truly...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
But it's just begun --
Do as I say.
Very much.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Last week would this be?
Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
Am I?
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Mm.
Sure you can, just--
He needs me here.
Sure
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Uh-huh
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
To make pictures.
So I've been told.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I'll remember that.
Do you?
Randolph!
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Uh-hub.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Pops
How much?
It's not really--
How much?
Yes.
One . . . buys things.
Marion--
I am not that woman.
There's nothing to explain
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't t-t-t-tolerate it.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
The drinking.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir?
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir?
Please be quiet.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
I can't remember the lines!
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That's right
Uh-huh
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
You are talking to him.
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Right-
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Like a bug.
But with compassion and insight--
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Jesus
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Why her?
She was . . . innocent
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Craig is one syllable
But it's not a great syllable
I just can't . . see it anymore
Fuck you. You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Kinda.
Hell, I know how it ends. Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Mank!
George...
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Oh God.
Yes.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're lying to me.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Yes
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Get out
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Get out.
Again.
Again.
Again
Again
Again
Pardon?
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
The ad..
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Well it' s all you've got !
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
No, we're jake. But listen-
I don't want to sit
Happy birthday.
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
We done?
Yeah.
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
For what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I'm Ok.
Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Ok, champ.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
And where you goin'?
None of your fuckin' business.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Here's your glove.
Jack! Enough!
Go ahead.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Whadda you care?
Yeah --
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Go 'head.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
You know, like bang her or anything?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What did Tommy say?
C'mon, Joey.
G'wan, do it. Protect yourself, rummy.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
What?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Whadda ya mean?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whatsa matter with you?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
Just give it a nice little tap.
Can you see it?
No.
What does that mean?
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
Come over here.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Come here.
Jake...
Do what I say.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Go 'head. Do it.
Now take your panties off.
Oh, Jake.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Positive.
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
All I did...
Don't ever do that again. You don't do it!
Jake...
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What're you talking about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
With Salvy, eh?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
What?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
OK. Talk.
Why don't you just call him up?
Then what?
I don't know.
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Sure, what else is new?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Are you drunk?
No. Open the door.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
All right, just don't make any noise.
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
What friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Get lost. Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Right, the gym.
Excuse me for living.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
He has it. Thank you.
Goodnight.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
That's what they call a family problem.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me. I've got to run, Jeff.
All right -- you don't believe me.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
I was jaywalking.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
Six ayem.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Not yet.
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Mrs. Thorwald.
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You sure it belongs to his wife?
You figured that out, huh?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your logic is backward.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
With that cast on -- you don't.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Next time, have some good news.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Something wrong?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Jeff --
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Yeah.
Did you get my note?
Who are you?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
No.
Tell her to bring it back!
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Well, I only quote from the best.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight. What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Stella!
She's only perfect.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
I was.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Depends one which one.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And some man will lose his.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
He and his wife splitting up?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
In this heat? They're up now.
Get back there! He'll see you!
Uh-huh.
Huh?
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
And digging in. Look at that flower bed.
Look!
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You can tell that from here?
Got a shovel?
No.
There's probably one in the basement.
Now wait a minute --
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary -- -- probably two-fifty. The piggy bank.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Uh-huh.
Only because it's expected of her.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
I wanted to, Jeff. Oh!
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Tired?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
That's good news.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
For what?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Of course not.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
Without any future?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
Something too frightful to utter.
Now, Lisa --
What is it you're looking for?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping. He's in the room now.
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What are you getting at?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
What about it?
I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Not yet!
Thinking about Thorwald?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful. I wish I could be creative.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I do?
Staying the night here, uninvited.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird. Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
But you're not?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Is he cleaning house?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
How?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Two minutes.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
I heard about it. You're lucky he lived.
They always live.
What's eating you, Judy? You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
What?
You watch too much television.
I'm cute, too.
What?
Chicken?
Who's fighting? This is the test, man. It's a crazy game.
Somebody find him a knife.
How 'bout you? Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Stay there.
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
Glad to meet you.
Okay.
Yeah.
I like you, you know?
Buzz? What are we doing this for?
We got to do something. Don't we?
We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier.
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
Nothing, Crunch. They picked him up like the rest of--
You see any cops?
No--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
No. We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You clean out of your head? Come on!
Hang loose. We got all night.
That maid saw us. She could identify us too.
You still want to go home, Moose?
No.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You make any sandwiches?
Sure-- You know something? I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
And you dropped it?
Yeah! Shh!
That's funny!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Yes.
Shoot, Jimbo.
What would you do, Dad?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Sure--there was a bad accident there. They showed the pictures on T.V.
I was in it.
She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!
Well--
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
I don't want to learn that!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Mom?
You don't?
No. I definitely don't. I did the sa--
Sorry.
What about you, Jim? Got anything to say for yourself?
Sure. Sure.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I think I know my son.
Really, Frank? When was that?
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
He's just loaded, honey.
I was talking to Jim.
What's that pounding?
I don't know. First I thought it was Jim but--
He's home. I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
Open it.
No, honey. No, he's not here.
Stay here. That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
Do you hear from him, son?
Well maybe she better start.
I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
In my mother's drawer.
Head-shrinker?
What's the charge?
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? Ever been booked before?
Hi there.
You remember me?
No. I don't think so--
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
What?
He's a wheel. So's she. It's hard to make friends with them.
I don't want to make friends.
Jim. What's yours?
Plato. It's a nickname.
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
They're still there!
Who knows. Plato?
What?
What's a chickie-run?
I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
No. It's okay.
O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me? What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.
We know.
They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
Judy.
Help me in!
I'm here. Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up. Are you nuts?
No. I'm scared.
Wow! Well now-there-then!
Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Come on!
Man, you're schizoid!
I'm what? What?
Hey! How 'bout that!
Not lately.
When was that?
Plato!
Your father!
Get away from me!
I'm here.
I know. Light a match, will you?
I'm fine.
No. At dawn.
Why?
I just have a feeling. Where are you?
Here.
You sure?
Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do. You want my jacket? It's warm.
What do you think?
My gun?
In your pocket. Give it to me.
I need it.
You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.
They like you. Okay?
Come on!
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me! I don't believe you anymore!
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom. I'm nervous or something--
Goodbye, dear.
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
And you wanted him to make a list!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What's that got to do with it?
Why should you be the only one.
Just tell a little white lie?
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Grandma?
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
No.
I don't know why--!
Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
If he could--
"If he could" what? You mean your father?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?
Any time--day or night. You calmed down enough to go back now?
You serious?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now. I'm warning you.
Yes, ma'am.
Listen--
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Where I saw you. Everything going okay now? You live around here?
Who lives?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah. So where's the high school?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Oh.
A what?
Goodbye! See you!
I'm not so bad.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I'm numb.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What? You still here?" Man!
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why?
I'm getting that way, too.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Sure. Lots of times.
So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where can we go? I can't go back into that zoo.
I'm never going back.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You decide, darling. Remember our budget.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing. What about--
See, we're very modern.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Not exactly. It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know.
Should we explore?
Hi.
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Are you?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already. We don't have to pretend now.
What a relief!
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love you, Jim. I really mean it.
We have to go back!
No! I got to find him.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.
He needed you, maybe. So do I.
They're killing him!
Yes. My best friend.
What's he like?
Okay.
It's all right.
Hi.
He hates me.
What?
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
No.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
No. I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street! I wasn't even near there!
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy. Take it easy.
We were romantic then too--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
No. Why?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
With us old creeps? Come on, we have to eat.
Daddy--
Hi.
What?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'm tired, Judy. I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
We're talking, aren't we?
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
To all those cons...
Searching for a money man...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.
I've been doing good, though.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Toys for... adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Thank you.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
Radio said.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Saw me --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
Smile.
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Yes it was all you --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. Hurry up!
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Beauty and fragrances.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
NICK!
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick --
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're not hearing me here --
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
I love you!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
...maybe I die for Nick...
Canada.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down?
What?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
We? What "we"...
Nick...
Get your own room.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Nick, the ice is --
Get to the bridge! HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
We'll need one.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Part of... with them?
I'm almost done.
He says he wants it now.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
No.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
They all are. Football's on.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Well. I'm going home.
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Who wouldn't.
I'm glad it was me.
Merry Christmas.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
What are you talking about?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
No, you can't --
The hell I can't.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Put him in the truck.
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
Yes!
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Samantha.
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
Hey.
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
I said, who the hell made the map?
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
You do.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
I'm gonna need some money.
Don't tip.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Nnn... nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
NO!
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
What's the code?
You need six.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No, you're not.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
'Tis the season, convict.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Ash?
How'd you know my name.
Take 'em.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Leave the tree.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
I don't know... what you're...
What... Powwow...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I don't steal any --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
He's not Nick Mason...
OPEN IT!!!
GO!!!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We're aware of your position.
What?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Cancer-sucker.
Acid-chewer.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
Hi, Nick.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Not with you.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
Where the hell's Gabriel?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Merlin, I didn't know --
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters... ...in the gelatin...
Oh, man --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Haven't thought about it.
Hell you haven't.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Oh.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hate your old man.
Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home.
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Standing right here, man!

You're hitting for MY cards!
What? No...
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
Now where were we?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Yes.
Fine, now.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Where was she from, Compton?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Was he all pissed off?
How do you know all this?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
What?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
...What bar?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
What?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
What?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
What? Snap out of it!
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
It's a change.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
Take a seat.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Dead as Dillinger.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Who gives a damn?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
What for?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Like hell I am.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Don't ask me that.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink? Why?
He don't tip.
He don't tip? You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it.
He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it?
Nope.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do. How do I look?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
We think we got a rat in the house.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Down to my car.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
I don't like alarms.
I'm okay.
Correct.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
It's not good...
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad. Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You really think we were set up?
I'm cool.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
A few cops.
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
What?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
We don't think this place is safe.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
What are you gonna do about him?
This is what he was doin'.
Yeah, those guys too.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe he did.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Look of things, she doesn't.
And one of 'em is sick.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can stay here if you like.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Go on, there's a good boy.
Yeah.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
He's learning his letters.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
They're stragglin'.
His letters will keep.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I hope so, too.
I suppose it is.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
Thanks.
You should know. She's in your dream.
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
That's fine.
It's too light yet.
Why do you think?
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
What?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
I'm sorry.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Goodbye, Mary.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
To the other side of the street.
Why?
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
Hello, Miss Wells.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
How's that?
A little hot.
A man I used to know.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
Nice.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Lednov.
Swimming.
That's right, Steve.
Can I have my gun back?
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
There's only two of them now.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You better start.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Kind of sore.
You'll live.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
He won't take us. Don't you want us around?
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Then why stay in the hills.
Plenty more. And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Well, say it.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
I don't like to see you go.
Now where's she goin'? --
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
How many ways can a man say no.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Everybody knows --
Who brought you here?
Stop it --
Where is he?
Up the trail.
I don't know -- I don't know.
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Put on another one.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Lookin' around.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
I sure would.
Maybe I could start you out.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Good night, Steve.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
What do they look like?
No.
How about California?
Would they be good to eat?
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Sure.
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
Thanks, Steve.
Steve --
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
If you need me, I'll be --
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
Wife?!
Ha! Right bitch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Never happened!
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Thanks.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Okay.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
No, stay.
You sure?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Yeah.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Open chest!!!
Okay.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Hugh Kane.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Yes...
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Huh?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Shit!
Can you feel that?
No. Try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Let's get a hot dog.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah. Can I borrow five bucks?
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
I think so.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.
But he'll kill her!
That means more screen time for us.
It's okay.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
Oh, right.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Right behind you.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Made you say it!
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We have to destroy him.
I'll go.
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
No, my friends are right here!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, I got an idea.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Got my camera right here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Who?
Saw who?!
Don't touch me!!
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Are these all the subjects?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Professor!
Fine. What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Even in the bathroom?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
What is it, Dwight?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What?
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
And sexy.
Of course. So sexy.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Second best.
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Then let us prepare.
Because she will lie?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
What?
What she said about your mother?
My holy water.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
Don't worry, I got your back.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
What happened?
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??...
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother?
0h, shit!
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
No! It wasn't like gore movies at all! IT WAS REAL!
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Always the dentist.
Is there a killer loose?
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"? WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
She sure can pick 'em!
Thanks, Mom.
Let me see!
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
God, Mom! What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
You scared me.
But, Chip...
This is so silly.
Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Your mom killed my brother!
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Bird books mostly...
Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
That's nice.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
No woman would!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
Don't I get a kiss?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Ooohhhh!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Oh, honey!
What a mess.
Yes, I did.
...People who don't mind their own business.
I certainly did.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
FUCK YOU!
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try... "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
GODDAMN YOU!
COCKSUCKER!
It's not fair!!
Are those pussy-willows?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I didn't do it!
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
I certainly was not!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I do, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
Sorry, Mom. Thanks. Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
No, honey, it's the police. Hello, officers.
Always something isn't it? Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back!
But... I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.
It's the least I could do. I heard shouting.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale.
Ewwww! Thank you, Rosemary.
...Browsing.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes, but I lent it...
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No... I don't have room in my kitchen...
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. A little something I baked.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Bon Appetit!
There is one big problem though.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
Now, here's a babe!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What's he know?
How to send a bill!!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming. Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Sure I do.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
You can't tell.
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
No.
You could go and open the door.
Listen 
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No.
Drink.
No.
Yes.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
What sort of danger?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Hello, Frances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Redi's all right.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I guess most people are.
Thank you.
I ought to know.
What is it?
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
You fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
Yes.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Good.
Goodnight, Mary.
But you do believe me?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
But you have treated me that way.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
The people at the restaurant?
Yes.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Good night.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
But I'm not joking.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Well, that's illuminating.
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
That you love Mary.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
I don't know.
You will die.
Good-bye.
Yes.
Yes.
And you knew he'd be here.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
What's wrong, Mary?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
But why come to me?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Uhhuh.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me what?
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
It might have.
I'd like that.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
Cloven hoof?
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
I don't know.
But you would like to know where she is?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
No. She's no longer under my care.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm afraid not.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
But she was here?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Yes?
She's very beautiful.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy. You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
When?
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Yes?
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Television?
Yes.
No. Why?
Curious.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Nine years.
Nine years?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
Younger.
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
Okay, I will!!
How do you mean?
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Why is that?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Impotent.
You are?
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Of course not.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Ann. Hello.
Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Videotapes.
I can see that. What are they?
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Not really.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
No.
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
Like what?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
To you?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
Yes, I do.
I know.
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?
That's a good question.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Then do it.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Does he go down on you?
Absolutely not.
Yes.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
Do you want me to stop?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
Yes.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.
On tape?
No.
Why not?
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
Her name was Elizabeth.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
How come?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Don't you get lonely?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I'm not planning on it.
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.
Why not?
Because.
I don't care.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Mmmmm...
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
I ate by myself.
Are you having an affair?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I know.
What?
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Yes!
Yes.
He does.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Yeah, I know.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
What visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
Why?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why, so you can go after him?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I wonder why.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And... do whatever it is you do.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
What's wrong with that?
I just thought it might --
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
No!
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I can't believe you did that!!
Why?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You couldn't do it, period.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
I feel like I do.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
You are in serious trouble.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It does not.
Hold on.
Thirty-two dollars.
Well. I can't stay.
No.
Okay.
Bye.
Did you take your clothes off?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
You want me to leave?
I just want to know why you're here.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
What do you get?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Why don't you let me tape you?
Doing what?
Talking.
About what?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
That's all.
Would anybody else see the tape?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
How do we start?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Your first sexual experience.
When I was fourteen.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Very much live.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
He said that my hand felt good.
Then what happened?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
If you wish. You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Hi.
I'd like to make another tape.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
No.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
No.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Right.
Why?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I did.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
You are scum. I'll be there.
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh. Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I want to see you.
When?
Right now.
Cynthia. John.
I don't think my sister would agree.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Why not?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
Hung up.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
You trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
What do you mean?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
Who?
Graham.
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
It'll just be me.
Student?
No. You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
How about for five hundred?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
A bonfire, probably.
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Really. How'd it go?
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
So is my wife, asshole!!
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Goddamit...
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Shut up!!!
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
One moment.
Yes?
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
All right, jesus.
Hi. Want a drink?
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
You knew these people?
He sounded fine.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Do I get a kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
No. Dotty's the last.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Just breathe normally.
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
That's the one.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
So who changes?
Did I say anything?
I don't get it.
OK. I'll think about it.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
No? How come?
Lemme clarify for you.
Huh?

I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Time to check with Flavors.
What's cookin', Bert?
What?
Nothing. Just...memories!
I got it! I got it!!!
Congratulations! It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
You got it!
I got it! I got it!!!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
He needs help.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Home?
After breakfast. You're sounding tense, Janet. Maybe I could give you a little massage?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
So it seems.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Dentonvale has been sold.
SOLD??!!
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself. The real you. The secret you.
Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Everything's free there.
...closed?
Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?
Yes, Betty.
Are you spoken for this evening?
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of fact...
Yes. Macabre, isn't it. The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
In a little masquerade?
President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really. What'll I pin this on?
Faith, Betty. But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.
Yeah, well. Here, Betty. I just came to give you this.
Shove it, Ralph!
You too, Betty!
I don't want to get up there.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.

TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He was adopted you know.
I'd forgotten.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Sure thing.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Of course.
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you.
Who?
Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
I know.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
You're practically naked!
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Vance! Vance Parker.
Don't worry, Janet. Brad'll probably get just what he needs.

Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Me?
It's classical. Almost a textbook case...
Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
You've got a really tight team around you. And everybody needs you!
But what'll I do? What'll I say? What'll I wear?
Of course. He was in great danger of harming himself.
Arrest that man! He's committed to our care.
I never signed the contract. He's not going anywhere.

I don't think he intends to go that far.
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet? Are you happy?
Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.

In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy. Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Surely.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
No.
We're not confused.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
It'll just take a second.
You guys having fun?
Good. That's good.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I love you.
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
And?
Yeah, I'm here.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Gary.
When's that novel of yours coming out? We all want to read it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
I'm good.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Stephanie.
Nice.
In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Oh yeah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great. You both do.
Not so bad yourself.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi. Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
You are not.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Well, in that case...
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
And Lexapro, yes.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
When do we get to drink it?
Now.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Want some?
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Whoa.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
You're blind, dude. Blind.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what? When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
What do you think?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Well, she is cute.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
I will. See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Yep.
What're you drinking?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
With this chick.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Yeah.
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
Thanks, Jack.
You're an asshole.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
Slaughterhouse.
What's happening?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
No.
What?
It's private.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
I say we check it out. You never know.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Keep it elevated.
Yeah.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
What?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
That was quite a day yesterday.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.
Back at you.
Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
Good for you.
See you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I know. I love that.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.
Hey.
She got anything good?
Yeah, I know.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Well, nice to see you now.
You too.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
Okay.
What rehearsal dinner?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
Victoria.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
See you over there, Miles.
Yeah.
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
French or American?
Both.
Good stuff.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Exactement!
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
It tastes old.
Only for pee or poop.
Right.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
It tastes funny.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I heard them Morgan.
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
Hi baby.
You love walks.
I don't feel much.
Good.
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...I will.
...Tell Graham --
I'm here.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
What? Colleen?... Colleen?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
You want him coming in the house next time?
I heard.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That's right.
I got him.
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
What does it matter then?
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Ray Reddy's house.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon.
They already know we're here.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They're right behind the door.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Got it!
From what?
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. We won Graham.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Me too.
Graham.
Don't.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It's old Morgan.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Don't do it.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Oh.
They tell you everything in this book.
That means they're unemployed.
Bimboo?
Dad.
I just asked his name.
They win.
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking. How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Sorry.
The footprints.
What about them?
There are none.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
What was the first thing?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay. So he was tall?
I would say so.
No.
You take care of yourself... Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Why not?
What did you say?
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
It's like War of the Worlds.
They think it might happen all at once.
What book!
They'll find a way in.
No money, eh?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
You're in here for winging a guy?
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
There's nobody coming?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Sounds good.
All right then. Let's go.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I'm sorry.
Have to.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
She was hurt... pretty bad. Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Right.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
Yeah... that must have been it.
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
It's one thing to know it...
I already did that.
This time you're really going? You know where I'll be.
That I do.
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
Ten A.M.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn. So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I'll be long gone.
You got no idea what they were after?
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I had to get up anyway.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Going to Turley, was it?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
It's not going to be easy.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Anybody got any ideas?
Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in.
Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I've got a job.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that?
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
The other guy drew first.
Right!
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
What now?
We wait.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Who is he?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Let's get out of here.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
Really?
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I was afraid of that.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Daddy's dead.
Who did it?
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
Why come to me?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Because they enjoy it.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
I heard that too.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men.
I've given that up.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
I just got to town.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
Luck, I guess.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this. They took the little boy, Cobb.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.
Good-bye, Paden.
I run the place. What can I get you?
Stella.
Paden.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
So-called?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
What do you mean?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I'm ready for that.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
I thought you two would get along.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Of course.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor? Tell the truth. You'll feel better afterwards.
We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
Excuse us.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Please.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
Out of the question. A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
No problem. Do you want to come in?
Why not?
"Forever".
Whatever. I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
If it's on the page...
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own. Theater training.
She was in the theater? When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe. Any woman can go up a dress size.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
What about it?
There isn't one.
No need. She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Thank you. What did you think, Lainey?
Who else? It's always Simone's idea.
I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
You really think so?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- I can explain.
She doesn't want pity.
You're so good to protect her like this.
I'll try. Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
She said you were very beautiful.
Really?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I always?
No.
No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Excuse me? Start?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
She's lying down. She's exhausted.
I can imagine.
When is she coming over?
About now. Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Not quite.
I just read somewhere --
I know. I know. They'll say anything.
Not if I don't let her.
You?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
No... it's life.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Where are you?
Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
Of course. What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
I have to talk to her.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Simone?
Is that a problem?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure. Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
And what may I ask brought this on?
It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Hello, Hal.
It was more in passing.
Body double.
For her?
But she's right there! I must feel her!
You can't.
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No. No. A real wall. You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
I know what you mean.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film. It's very... experimental.
Simone!
I have her, Mr. Taransky. The answer to your prayers. The answer to this.
I have your new leading lady... ... right here in my pants.
Good for you, Hank.
Don't be. It was worth it.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank. A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's why you're so perfect. You have something I don't have.
What's that?
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
I'm already dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I can't believe you people! No wonder she never comes to these things!
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey. It's just --
I know you'll do it, Dad. You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
I missed you. I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Me too.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
You know, I... don't know.
Is she here tonight?
She can't watch herself.
Why?
Okay. But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
How?
I read.
You do? Still? I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Precisely.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay. How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
I noticed.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know. Thank her for me.
Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
Me and Simone. What I did.
An insanity defence.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do. I know it's a fake.
The background is.
She was never in New Mexico. She never left the studio.
-- I bet you have.
Er,... good.
No. Thanks. Absolutely.
Don't you?
This should take care of Mother.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Yes, very.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Is that why she left you?
I don't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
You're in breach.
Taller? What?
Yes.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes, I'd like that.
You could play the lead.
But that's Simone's part.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Perfect. God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
... digitized.
Yes. Yes, it is.
No. I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
The only real truth is in the work.
You know what I'm talking about.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I didn't leave you.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Thanks.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Congratulations.
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Look over there.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
I don't tell her a thing.
Why?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
She died a long time ago.
Words.
What kind of words?
Upset words.
What?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Who me?
I forgot myself.
Yes.
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
What?
Never mind.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Them?
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
I don't know, Cole.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
When?
Soon. One week.
Don't fail me.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was... I was a fake.
You weren't a paper champion.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes.
You believe me, right?
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No, we're not.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
I guess she did.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
Really?
And you know what else?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Oh.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
So who moved it?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Tell you my secrets.
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
Got it.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
I know.
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They used to hang people here.
Like what?
Stop it!
You're a stuttering Stanley!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Stop looking at me.
Who!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
It's our pleasure.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
How'd he know I'd come?
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Chicken blood on the crops.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You're standing in horseshit.
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Two.. maybe three days.
Nope.
See?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck you.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Witch.
Tramp.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Bitch.
Not according to these.
Someone actually... employs you?
I happen to be a professional.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
The band.
Not lately.
The hell with this. I'm coming back up!!!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
No shit.
Not someone -- Mac.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Book of Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Hi Suze.
Harvest moonshining!
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Pardon?
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I'll be fine here.
I don't think so.
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
-- By way of my breasts?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Who? Us?!
The audience!
Who you callin' "boy?"
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Amen.
He's right. You were behind.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Nothing to tell.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
So?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
I said that's enough!
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Mmmm -- so can I...
You never had trouble communicating before.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
It's you. You and your father.
No --
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
No. Not without you --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Never.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like what?
Like your guitar break.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Second verse!
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Why bother?
What'll we do?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Bill, we need to talk!
'Mornin', Jack.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
That's not funny.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
No. What ?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Starla, it ain't --
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
That wasn't a good night, no.
I'm sorry.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
What?
Aspirin.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Sorry.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Do it.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Don't worry, Chief.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Hell, I was game!
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Shut up.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Brought you munchies.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
What can I do you for?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
How many you need?
It's just a work thing.
Sure you do.
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.
You're pretty.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
What other stuff?
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
If...?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Four hundred cases worth. Well?
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Okay.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Shoot.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Like what?
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Uh-oh.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Then let's change the subject. What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
I know. Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Ummm?
Bandit II?
What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week. Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Maybe six months with good behavior. One to five.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Hey...
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.
Yes.
I'm begging.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
But you'll do it?
I'll do it.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
You sure do.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
Another time.
No.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
How'd you know?
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Waynette!
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
See.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
But I still don't think...
Running blocker.
Go.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Let's keep it that way.
Redneck heaven.
Can a pig whistle?
They're jammed!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Clear and rolling.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's your twenty?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Not for long, you ain't.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
What does the old Timex say?
Yeah, guy?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Bandit?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
We'll be waiting. Over.
You okay?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down. Right, Fred?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Let's boogie.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm here.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Go head on, breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom? Excuse me.
Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
He's thirsty.
About one to five years worth.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
What's he...
Yes, ma'am.
How's your twenty?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
Yes, sir.
Chickenshit money.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Of course. Yes.
And who has access to that floor?
Maybe.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
No.
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Uh, yeah.
You're sure?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Ww... uh...
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Pretty much, yep.
Mmm-hmm.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
Thass' right. I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Yeah, why.
...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I'm not doing cocaine.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I been accused of worse. What do we got...?
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Look at the collar on that coat...
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
They what? What? No. No. Why?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
...He does now...
...Almost. What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
I wouldn't go that far.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, I can front this.
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
How are we on time...?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
I'm working on it.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
It's gettin' done Sid.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
You love her?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? You hurtin' pretty bad?
Got hit twice.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
Like a mafucka.
That takes some of the sting out.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
A Fed? Like FBI?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Security's locking down the elevators.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
What's the time frame?
Leave the light off.
It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
No? Who am I, then?
A puppet.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.
Where's his body?
In the lab. With her, probably.
Her? Who are you talking about?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Yes.
That's fantastic.
Why did you agree to come here?
Not her. It.
No, she won't.
Why would you let her to do that?
Whose side are you on?
How quickly?
Yes.
He's dead.
How?
What?
Where's Sartorius?
In his lab. He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.
Who was it?
She was real. Where did she come from?
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
That depends.
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
Shut up.
And professionally?
Dead?
Rheya.
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
Told you what?
To who?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
I don't know.
What is it?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Why?
Just a little strategy session. But in person this time.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Who are you trying to convince?
No.
Human beings can die.
That's right. And we all have to sleep, eventually.
She drank liquid oxygen.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What plan?
Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Maybe she doesn't need any. Should we check?
I won't be making the trip.
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
Maybe you can.
Yes.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
I'll be right back.
To calm your anxiety.
To calm my anxiety.
Yes.
I want you inside me right now.
Book?
Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
Better.
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Rheya. Not here.
You go home.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
You talk like an actor.
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
All right. How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you mean?
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
You still don't believe in God?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
As I said, then it's God, right?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
You don't know?
I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
I think so.
Good. Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I know. I'm putting that in my next report.
Yes. Yes.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
Stop.
That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.
Sartorius.
When? When I'm asleep?
Yes. Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No. I love you.
I love you, too.
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
Not this time.
Do you?
If you're here.
Gibarian. He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is. But he was here...
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.
Rheya --
Don't call me that.
No.
You're lying. I'm not human.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
Then you'll die.
I want every second I can get with you.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
I can't stay here.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Then you won't make it.
I want you here.
You're lying.
You exist here. I keep telling you.
That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I wish you wouldn't.
They do something to me. It's hard to think straight.
I think they help.
I can't --
I don't know anymore. All I see is you.
A sleeping pill. Do you want yours?
I don't know. Something. Anything.
When?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You must have been dreaming.
Shhhh. Just stay with me. Stay with me. Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Why do you say that?
He won't.
We want to talk freely.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
And so what's with Steinhart? Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Hard to find doors in this place.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.
Queens... You know Queens?
My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.
Nice. Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
Beg pardon?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
I got money.
Not too sure about that.
Hey! There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I came on at 8:00.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Yeah, what a woman.
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
They're kind of fuzzy.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
No kidding.
Could be, I guess.
Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
Okay. Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah. It was.
And "is"...?
That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
But "nice".
Very nice.
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
You could do better.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in...
No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire, will you calm down?
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
They called here after you left...
She's okay. Everything's okay...
This is me, Mike. There's nothing else...
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Are you okay?
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I know.
I know.
... Don't explain.
Long enough.
"For"...?
"To"... Forget about you.
Yeah...
It's Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Mike...?
Yeah. It's all over.
So.
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I do.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire. We all do --
And I'm making mine.
Nothing.
The gun? It's in the upstairs closet.
Sure we are, let's go!
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
Too kinky.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling. It is.
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
You got no idea...
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.
Why?
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.
Why?
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
Should I wait up? We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault! I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What're you talking about --
I'm sorry.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
What's the difference?
He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world, huh?
No.
I'm all right.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Even Joey Venza?!
I heard.
It should've been me...
Call a cruiser!
Koontz! I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT. We'll get the locals. Throw it!
No, I need'm now!
You in this with me?
Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy. He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?
No, sir...
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I brought the girl. She's outside.
I'll prove it!
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
Bullshit! Prove it.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
I know where everything is.
Lay back, Mack!! What's this "lay back, Mack?" Where does he get this?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?" You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
We're gonna pass the street.
Shooting.
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Take care, pal.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
Let me see.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy?
No not really.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Oh, sure.
Cause if you get in a bind--
No, no.
I know.
I'm always here, Pete.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
See?
Or was it all a dream?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
I'm parked illegally!
Hm. What a lump.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry!
Harry
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Let me guess. The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I know. I've got one too.
I am not pitiful! I am the bridge to the bermensch!
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Lemme down, bugface!
That's not even close.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right? Got your camera?
Yeah--
Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks.
Can we make it a hundred?
Seventy. But I want blood and gore. You know, sexy stuff.
Gimme that. Pick it up later.
No! Now get outta my face, kid.
Police, help! Po-- mmph.
Fine.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight. Bright colors. Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
A spider. Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Deal. But don't tell anyone. I want to keep a low profile.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I see. So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Just call me Spidey.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Thanks, I already ate.
Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Just about. See, I also have this amazing strength.
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Oh. Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate--
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Yeah. Really gets to you if you let it.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz. You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene. Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
Hurry up, Flash!
I've gotta study.
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
I'm sure you kept warm.
I've got no problems.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever. That was just nasty.
That was then. I'm better since the lobotomy.
I think I'd like that.
So? The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You'd feel what?
Unh-huh. Excuse me. I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Why?
Nah.
So you've found Thorkel?
I know him.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence. "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right? We'll see ya.
Peter-- my condolences.
Any sign of our friend?
Precise equipment such as waldos
That's the understatement of the year.
Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I'll introduce you.
Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Yes. Do you have a date?
No.
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu. Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
You were adorable. The least you could do is use a glass.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Use a fork.
See? You big dullard.
It's fine. Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Power down. I need to talk to you.
Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Let's talk in the hall.
I couldn't care less. What I've done is--
No!
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
You have no right! This is cosmic suicide!
Hi, Professor. What's up?
An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Really, Professor, I--
How much do you know about it?
Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
No, thank you. I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Luck. The right place at the right time.
Really. I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know. Go get some sleep.
I'll try. Thanks.
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
No
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then. Bye.
Like it?
Nah. The big mask was better.
Yup. Oh, here's your check, minus my commission. Solid, solid novelty act.
What?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Loonytunes. And yet...
Just drop me off here.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war. Pull those cables--
No, no! Not there!
They never caught on.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
What's the match gag?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Looks good outside.
Static!
Roger.
Okay. Move on.
Get going on the trap door.
That'll do.
We'll get some more.
I don't know anymore.
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
And maybe a little something else?
A little something what?
Take it.
Why not?
Thanks.
Forget it.
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
How much more do we have to take from him?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Don't wear it out!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
What some brandy?
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's!
What is your number?
105-353.
Abfuehren!
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You're teasing me again!
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
No?
Where'd that come from?
It's beautiful! You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
So what? There's other women!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
You did?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine, too.
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
Why, sure!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
You want to go?
No. I want to draw.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
You have a Lieutenant here...
Yes, sir.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Any objections, men?
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
What radio?
Come on, everybody! Let's go!
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Are we boring you?
Says who?
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You starting that again?
Anybody cover?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Check.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Just what makes you so popular?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Oh.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What about the radio?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
I'll kill you for that!
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Fine -- fine!
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Yes, you do!
No! No!
How many do you want? A thousand?
Not particularly.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
HoS qorDu.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
He is.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Full disruptors.
Thanks for pointing that out.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Twelve years, sir.
Can you project its course?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Commander.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Agreed.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
You get what?
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
We better get you back to the ship La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
The station complement was nineteen.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I hope so, sir.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
On screen.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
You're in the Nexus.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
It's our pleasure.
Please, please.
Oh, of course.
Please, I insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. Something's missing.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Better?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
You could say that.
Yes. Thank you.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
I thought you might.
Aye.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I always do.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
What do you want?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Make it so.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
The Nexus.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
There are no other ships in the system.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Lock phasers and return fire!
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Tractor beam, aye!
Execute!
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
Nothing. As before.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
On screen.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
What is it?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature -- Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
... Fascinating.
It's a little early to celebrate.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why?
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Did your collaborator know?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
No!... I'll do it. Give me your phaser.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Sir...?
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
What's wrong?
They've knocked out the damn automation center. I've got no control over anything!
Just him, sir!
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Goodbye, David.
What? What are you saying?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
Yes. And I know you.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
You would have done the same for me.
Why would you do this...?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
The ship... Out of danger...?
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... A cloaking device?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
About a dozen officers and men.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
Come on!
Go, Sulu!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
No, sir, no response.
Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Any time.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Because you wish it.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
But -- why?
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Of course...!
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What must I do?
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Understood, my lord.
Station!
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Good. This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They know we would die first.
I trust my instincts. Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Yes, my lord!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Wait!... Wait...
Put him on screen! Study him well.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
How is that...?
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
All true.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
You're not going in there -- !
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Uh -- what are they?
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Say thank you.
Thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
From yourself, Admiral.
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Our first order of business is survival.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
I have my orders.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Jim please --
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Maybe...
Mother, go back!
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it? Come on.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I can hardly see --
I saw it -- !
There's an air-lock.
Ssssh!
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You can't!
Uh, no... I should be on the bridge.
Are you running away from me?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I am truly sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Only half of you would get there.
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
Oh, I believe it.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Raise them --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Visual --
Rake her.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
Raise the shields...
I shall avenge you --
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Aye, sir --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
A few shots, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Do it, while we have time.
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
He'll die -- !
Admiral, this is Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
The word is given: warp speed.
Aye...
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Home.
To be sure, Captain.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Yes.
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual! Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Too late --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
Affirmative, Admiral.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
A distinct possibility.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Aye sir --
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?
Best we could do in two hours.
Steady as you go...
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes --
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Take the test again.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Erased...
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
They just don't want us going in there.
At what.
All stop, sir.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Aye, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Distance from Reliant...
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Understood, sir.
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Aye, sir --
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
Visual.
Trying, sir!
Scotty!
Phasers locked...
Try again.
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Aye, Captain.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'll try, Captain.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Course heading, Captain?
Ready, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Never, sir.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I would accept that as an axiom.
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
Fine. Just fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Gillian --
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Please...
A moment alone, please.
What do you mean?
Are you sure? That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
We've done it before.
That's crazy!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Cramps.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Then how.?
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
It is.
We're just -- observing.
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Like what?
The top of what?
Name?
My name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
I am? May I go now?
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, aye.
May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
We are launching everything we have.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
I suppose they told you that...?
The hell they did.
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.
Go ahead.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
It's his way.
Implicitly.
Good. A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Who do you think I am?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
I'm all ears.
You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
So. There we are.
Right.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse. Scotty, get us out of here!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Whales?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
In progress, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
I have.
Explain.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much?
... Simple logic.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Ah... The giants.
Yes?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
Exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
The hell I can't
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
... I see.
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Right. Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Weapons systems?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Steady!!... Now, Mr. Sulu!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Picture, please.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Aye, sir!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Mr. Sulu?
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
On screen!
Yes, sir.
On speakers.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Everyone remember where we parked.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Uhura, you did what was necessary. Keep trying. You'll find him...
Uhura!... Where!
Mercy Hospital.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Put them on screen!
On screen.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
About 60 feet, Admiral.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Two?
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see -- Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Mr. Sulu?
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
How long, Scotty?
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
On my way...!
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
You will be in good hands here.
Do you have the right to murder?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Of course.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Right on. You fly?
Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Old, yes. But interesting. Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Will it?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
For someone so young.
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
This way!
I thought it might begin the healing process.
You're what?
I am better.
I understand.
I don't.
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Really.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
No, I mean...
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Bye.
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
No.
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Is it safe to move her?
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
From the mission...
How about a passive radiation scan?
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
I don't know.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
It is not over.
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Scan for lifesigns.
Recommendations?
Deploy the collector.
Thank-you for reminding me.
Are they...?
Do you have everything you need from command?
Do you know how they were damaged?
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Eject the core.
If it works you mean.
Why not?
On screen.
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
How long 'til they reach us?
Eighteen minutes...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
We're not going anywhere.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Aye, sir.
Go back to your quarters That's an order.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Ask them.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We're trying to get to you, sir...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sir?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir...
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Gorch?
Picard to Crusher...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
We have to find shelter...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Say the greeting again...
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Good question.
What...?
What you're doing to my neck...
Was I doing something to your neck?
If that's true, they're a dying race.
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
Augh?
I never kissed you with a beard before.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Activating injector assembly.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
I look forward to reading your report.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes...
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
That'll be interesting.
I'll be fine. He's a different story.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
At least four hours.
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Bag him.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...
More lies.
I'm your creator now.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Vulcan?
No.
I believe so.
Do it.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
Contact Starfleet Command.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Where?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Let's go.
How serious is the damage?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I have the password right here.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Always am.
Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
She's a very... determined woman. Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
What's still there?
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
I'm on it...
One minute to warp threshold...
Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
We're crossing the threshold!
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Great name. French?
Yes.
You don't sound French.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
There's a few of us left.
Huh.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Something wrong with that?
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Yes, he is.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
I can try.
You're lying.
What makes you say that?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
How did you know about that?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
We?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Or...?
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No. It's a lot further than that.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Why?
Aye, sir.
On screen.
Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Steady as she goes.
Fire!
Onscreen.
Worf... torpedo... now!
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
On screen.
Life signs?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Yes, sir.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Unless you'd like to stay.
No, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
What?
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Agreed. Options?
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Where the hell are they going?
What are you suggesting?
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
Hold that thought.
Riker here.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
Target...
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
The charge is murder.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Fascinating...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
That's the question -
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Can you - ?
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
We've been set up all along.
We're not finished.
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Don't remind me.
No way. You see this?
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Come on...
To be -
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Then let me help!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Retire.
Barely.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
How can I trust --
Take them away.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
For insubordination.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
Shields up, Captain --?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
ALL uniforms?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Onscreen.
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding? Send to Starfleet Command...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to it.
We must do this again soon.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
I like it here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
He's got it.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Krandog aranty.
There's a reward for your death.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Except us.
It IS possible.
Where do we come in?
Energize...
Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aye, sir.
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman - ... so I volunteered.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Right -
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Captain.
Sir?
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You hear that?
Sulu!
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
You have personally -
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's... ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
LET THEM DIE.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
From Enterprise?
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
Why would they give them to us?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
... is to trust him.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
WE SURRENDER.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat Enterprise surrenders --
Who else?
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Faith...?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
An omission. After that -
An error.
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
Confirmed, Captain!
We've been ordered to -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
Visual!
What is it?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
What's left of it.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
A computer canna lie, sir.
I think not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That could take hours!
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
I know precisely where he'll be.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Would they?
This one can.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
I believe I am.
Aye, aye, sir.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
No.
Is that your final answer?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I know.
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
How long is that?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Yes.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
Soon then. Ill save the last dance for you.
To happy endings.
And this makes you "sad"?
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Thank you, Data. Let's see what she can do.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Yes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Divert power and compensate.
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.
Negative.
Sir.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
You do not look like me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Why?
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Yes.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Why is it moving?
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.
And I you.
I don't know.
I know how he thinks.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Make it so.
This isn't about me anymore.
No!
You sick bastard!
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Do you have life support?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Sir?
Weve got him!
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
Number One. You have the bridge.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
What sort of signature?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Who was it?
On screen.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Your new chair, sir.
Acknowledged ... ...I'll talk to Data.
A coup d'etat?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
Counselor?
She's a predator.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Can anything be done for him?
And the Romulans invade.
We can only hope so.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Praetor Shinzon?
No?
I've never met a human woman.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I have dissolved the Senate.
Yes.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
How did you end up on Remus?
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
Were we always explorers?
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
New worlds.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
I know.
In time.
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You're not Reman.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
But you want to.
Please.
Its too late.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
I am.
On my way.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
He's a very unusual android.
Runs in the family.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
We're being hailed.
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
A matter of hours now.
Seven minutes.
You heard me.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
She is here.
They're holding position.
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
None.
But surely...
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I have a purpose.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Silence, Romulan!
Now go. I have some personal business.
I don't want to scare them away.
I don't see anything.
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so...
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
Sure.
I'll take that.
Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
Credit card.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
No.
No.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
About five miles back.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's in a green Mustang?
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Oh shit!!!
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
No, we don't.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
What?
I just retired.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
This is George Fox...
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Okay...
Watch it. They're coming out.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
Don't... don't do this... please...
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Which way do you want to go?
What.
Ah no.
What.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Police...
Good.
Good.
That way.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
Pancakes.
X...
Money.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Smile.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.
This car runs on gas.
Yes. Very good.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Closed?
You'll see.
Jennyhaydn.
I am...
From?
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
Closed.
I know.
My... husband.
I am husband?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
No.
Yes.
Candy.
A drink.
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
This stuff could kill... Be my guest.
Shit!
Horses.
Music.
You didn't even see it.
You better.
My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.
I do not understand.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.
How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
Three nights... two days.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
Is that a baby?
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
Why?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
But I speak English.
You want this ticket?
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
The car will stop?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
No.
Yes.
Go?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Yes?
Please stay.
What?
It's a kiss... Goodbye...
I was afraid.
It was a mistake.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes?
Yes.
I don't understand 'friend.'
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
It's bad.
He will.
Are you my friend?
Yes.
I am your friend.
Why?
I don't know.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
Yes.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
Yes. Sing some more.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
On the radio they say it's good.
Hurry up.
No. Get in.
You can have one.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Come on.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Where did you learn that?
The cook.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
No.
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What for?
I want to gamble.
I know how to gamble now.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
The cook again?
Yes.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
I understand.
I will say that we can be friends.
We can.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I'd like to...
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Yes.
Many, many days and nights...
No, thank you.
Where?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
No.
I will.
Goodbye.
You could have killed us both!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Call the police!!
Hey buddy... let her go...
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
In the cars, too?!
I don't know where he is.
What? No, of course not.
Sure.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
I did.
We're ready.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
You have no conception of this, do you?
Very beautiful country up here...
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
No.
Wait'll you see it.
No, sir. Radar.
It could have been anything.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
I know, but...
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
Yes.
The police think he was high on drugs...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Hop in.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
No.
Judy, that's stupid.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
We can't let you do that.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
Hey, fuck you, man.
A star is born.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.
What're you going to do?
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Forget it's there.
Make me forget it, baby.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I'm already hurting.
Tonight.
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
What? He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Iris is dead. She was murdered.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Tell me.
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this.
No. Mace is in this.
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
What a nightmare.
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
That's right.
Step into my office.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Shutup a second!
Yeah. No, not really.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
W'sup, Max?
I'm on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam.
Is he dead?
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Thanks, buddy. See... things weren't bad enough. They weren't fucking bad enough!
No. Bad idea.
I intend to.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
You bet. Did you like it?
Naawww.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What else you got?
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Well... the guy's fucked up.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.
Who was just here?
Iris, man. Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute. Iris was here?!
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
Your existence.
Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--
Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives.
Define illegal.
Define love.
Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
In LA? Are you crazy?
Get it.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
She's my destiny.
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
No idea.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO!
Black. Jack.
Blackjack? I don't understand--
Wants to share.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Never really thought about it.
So that gives you something.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Yeah. I'm ghosting pretty bad.
No it doesn't.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Jesus, Mace!
Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
No shit. You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
It's in my case. Okay? I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.
It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, isn't it?
You sure?
I can't tell you. You've got to see.
Uh unh. I won't do it.
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah I know. So what do we do?
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
There's a plus side?
How long does it last? Oh.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.
Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
No. It didn't.
Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig didn't work out. Come on.
No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
And do what? Take on his whole posse?
Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
No. Trust me.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah, right. Fucked.
Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Yeah. We did.
See you downtown.
Yeah. See you there.
Just Lenny.
Right. That explains it.
Are you going to make me beg?
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Take the tape to the cops.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Yeah.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
The diner?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
You tell me.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
What?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Winona.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Excuse me?
You know, you ever think about other women?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
What did he look like?
He had an orange hat on.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
What kind?
At the field office.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Just an observer.
Smarter than us.
What?
We have another one.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Please.
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
MyDick.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Then why do I still have a badge?
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Do you think he singled you out?
Go ahead.
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Huh?, sir.
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Thank you, Rangers. Put this man in the unmarked.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
None taken.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Five months. I love it.
Not especially.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
You want to have dinner?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
What's that?
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
We did find these, however.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Oh.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Not the way I can.
I just need to go a little slow.
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Suspect Zero.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
What's going on?
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I...
I've got to take a piss.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Sit back.
No weapon.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
I'll be back.
The little piggie speaks.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yes.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Yeah.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Follow me.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Thomas Mackelway.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Sounds like fun.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
The same.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
I don't...
I talked to him.
350 miles.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him. It's Agent Mackelway.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Take your shirt off.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
It didn't feel that way.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Are you calling Her?
No. Stop, come on.
Shuddup.
Shut up.
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
Oh... a Cavalier.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Not lately.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
You too?
Yeah.
I thought I was going to die.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
How?
What what? What advantages?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything?
Anything.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Oh. You know.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...Four days..?
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
He is so sweet.
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
I'm a comedian.
Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
You want this in black chips.
Sure, that'll be fine.
No...
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Who's your booking agent?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
What do you do, Trent?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I understand.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
It's not going to well?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good. I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
I heard you might be moving back...
You don't call.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
Kinda.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I've decided to get out there. Go ahead. Play it out.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight.
What'd you get?
An eight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
Bud.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Ah, there's the rub...
There's the rub.
I just tested for one...
...yeah, a month ago.
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Him?
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I'll be your winger.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
They turned you down?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
Sure.
You always know the right thing to say.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Make someone bleed.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
So, what? Eleven?
He's trying to be an actor.
...He's derivative...
Damned if I know...
Not well.
Rejected?
I can't believe you.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
You asshole.
She's really special, guys.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
Wow, I guess you were home...
Coffee... Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
S'up Trent?
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Wait.
What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Vegas!
Vegas.
Whu?
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Baby, we're money.
Stop. Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Yes!
I'm telling you!
What?
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Hold on.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She was hot.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
How?
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
This version doesn't have fighting?
No. Doesn't that suck?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
Yeah. You met him once.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
...It looked money.
It's on.
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
What?
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't notice.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
That doesn't matter.
What a surprise.
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
We're not messing with you...
No, baby!
A day.
Tomorrow?
No...
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...Is he brown?
...How novel.
...It's on.
No.
Now?
No.
Is she looking now?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
What was cold about it?
You think?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
True.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
...Yeah.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Shut up, Sue...
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...
...just be smart about it.
Our little baby's growing up...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Six.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll be back with the coffee.
Good. He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Then make them suffer as she suffers. How much shall I pay you.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
You have to answer for Santino.
Good, good. Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
Shut up.
OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least?
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
No, just you and Paulie.
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.
OK, but be careful.
Maybe less...
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
No.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
And with prison record.
This morning.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
Yes.
Now you've had your drink.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country. It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
No.
I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
You wanted me to be your son.
What else do you believe in?
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
How?
Yes.
Good.
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
There is nothing there. Not anymore.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been killed.
How do you know I come from America?
We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
Yes.
Shhhhh.
This was a beauty. Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
And hair. Black and curly, like a doll. And such a mouth.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
No.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike!
Get rid of them...
Okay. One minute.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
We should hear what they have to say.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all.
An accident. No one was hurt.
Mama, no.
I'll worry about Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Thanks Tom.
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Did he give you his politicians?
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes. Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
How do you do.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
Sure.
Just you.
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
No.
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK.
When will I see you again?
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
Goodbye.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Let HER ask.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
Theresa.
What?
One of them fingered the old man.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say? Is he that good?
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
Probably a year...
Maybe.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Be patient.
No. I want things very calm for another six months.
I can arrange security.
Thanks.
The hotel, the casino. The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You think I scam?
You're unlucky.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so. Detective squad?
What are you doing in Mongi?
Sure. Any time.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
We?
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent. What's yours?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Did you speak to my father?
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh, it was.
Yes please!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay. And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Can you mix a martini?
Sure.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Bird!
Your parents met her.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
What?
You're breaking my ribs!
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
What are you talking about?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
What?
So cool.
So tell me.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
I love Marge.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Ciao bello. Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Dickie?
Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
What about Christmas?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Hardly.
Have you done something to your hair?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
I'm sure we've met.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
It's superb.
My fiance.
I'm fine.
Sure.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you -- so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Ha. Did he say why?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
You were going to Venice.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Hello Marge!
Tom.
To the manner born.
And you, sir? Any better?
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
What?
No glasses.
Do you know Tom?
I hope so.
I think we sort of found each other.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Excuse me?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily. Just kidding.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the...?
Right.
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I'll take them both.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
Exactly. 10.30 --
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur.
A ragione. A ragione.
Hmm. C'e questa...
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you.
Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
That's good, isn't it?
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
He says so many fiances.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
I give up.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost.
And don't forget. I have the key.
...Tom is a mystery...
Yes?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice?
Postmortem?
No.
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
No!
31 people.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have!
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
I got money.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
Huh?
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
You want to canvass?
Yes, mam.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.
Really?
I know. I could have picked you up.
Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Kris Kristofferson.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No. I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
What's wrong?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
My God!
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Can I call you?
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Sure.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
With who?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Ouch!
Oh, are you all right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Is he Italian?
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Could you see anything?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
And what happened?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
One-Ball McCall?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
In the jungle. 122nd.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Nah. I suppose not.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
A girl needs protection.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Easy.
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
You want to make it like this?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?
Don't you understand anything?
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Where is home?
Pittsburgh.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He shoots dope too.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I don't know. Just should, though. Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
My work may take me out of New York.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
No.
Yes I am.
There must be something...
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean. As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Yes, Sir.
Why do you ask?
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
I was in the Army too. And I'm good with crowds.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Sure.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop. I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
Take it or leave it.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.
Funny, you don't look hip.
O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Iris?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Real down.
It happens.
Yeah.
I know.
Like do anything, you know.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right. I seen enough to know.
Thanks.
You want to talk about it?
You know how I feel about what you do.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Hey! Now there's some good news.
You think I'm too... ethnic for country music?
Okay. How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years, Bill. We've lived together six years.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening? Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL? Get him back!
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
I'm a field agent.
Tell me what you really do.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Yes. You'll be outside.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del. Goodspeed follows him.
Wait. Where're you going?
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you think?
It's all I could think of.
Wrong.
What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
It's about time.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Partners.
You knew? All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Yes. To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
What's that? Mason?
Hi.
Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
I am, too.
Whatever happens.
Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
Damn...
Delly? In here.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That's my girl! Did you...?
That always used to work.
Dad...
It's possible.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I've seen you before. Your picture...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Me too.
You look... different.
I do?
Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
Well... where can we go?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Why me?
Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.
Through the door. It comes apart.
And why not?
Whoa.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What did... what did I want to be?
Yes. Hic!
Nothing.
Do you have the...
I'm fine. Really.
Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...
Oh...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
What?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
Oh.
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Exactly. And he got good.
No kidding.
Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
Oh. Okay.
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
That's... pretty frightening.
Thanks.
Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Shhhhhh.
Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father!
Exactly. Break it to her gently.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No. But...
But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou. Either one.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
The Bijou?
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
Harry, son. Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
Nine and-a-half years...
Can't wait.
Ah.
Mother. She's beautiful.
Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh. What... what time is it?
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
... Ernie.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You bet.
Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Oh, no, I...
Yes.
Ha!
... what?
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
The film broke...
I know, I know... keep still.
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Vultures...
What.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Zackly.
You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
Pete...
No, sir.
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
I guess I did.
Thanks.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
Call me... Ishmael?
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
Wish I could say the same thing.
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Jesus.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Thirty a month.
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I... I don't believe this.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
I was decorated.
I know. A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
Why not?
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
Exactly.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.
Why not?
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
When was that?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
Some of it might come back to you.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
No.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Cat.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
Of course.
Oh.
Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
Thanks.
The customers? I don't know...
They will. They w-w-will.
Oh.
It's about me.
Oh.
My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
I thought you...
You bet, honey.
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...
Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.
You look familiar, fella. What's your name?
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe.
Yes. Very.
Got any money?
Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
Who?
My girlfriend. If she still is...
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
All right. All right. We'll see.
Yes?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No, not really.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Yes.
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Thank you.
Yes, I did.
Yes?
That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...
All right.
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there? Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
She already has a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Then go.
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Cathy!
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're birds!
Take them.
Yes?
Your brother told me.
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
What's the matter with them?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Alice, I think. Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name, you see.
Yep. Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
It's nothing.
Birds are not bad!
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
Well, you're the lawyer.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
No. Here's fine.
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
When?
I don't know when. We'll see what...
Where will we go?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Get a rope!
I know you can. But I'd like to.
You're doing fine.
I mean. I want to...
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
You don't have to.
No, not exactly.
Oh, thank you.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What good will they do?
What?
Cathy. At the school.
Do I sound foolish to you?
No.
I wish I could be that way.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Did you close the door?
And locked it.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
Not by the thousands.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well... Well... these birds attacked us.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
He's not home.
That's all right.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well, I...
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Sixty... Oh.
I'm awfully sorry.
What?
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
Hey, wait a minute!
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I am. Good day. Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
What made it...
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Only violators and practical jokers.
I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To see a friend of mine. Will you please be careful?
I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
Why...
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Yes.
I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
Famished.
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
His wife changed the channel.
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Why?
I think it could be fun.
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Helping travelers.
Yes.
Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
Yes.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
No, thank you.
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
I think I should, don't you?
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
Mmm?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, no...
...everything I know.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Don't let's take any chances.
We've got to get Cathy.
The bay doesn't.
How long have they been gathering there?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Yes. I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
How about you?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
No... wait. Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
What do you suppose it is?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
Well, all right, but...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
To... To kill them.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
I'm not sure, but...
If you don't even know what you want to do...
With smoke.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But can't you give me any idea?
Good morning.
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Of course I will.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
I'm cold as ice.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
But Richardson?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But you did promise.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
They'll be thinking of that, too.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Not yet.
You'll be a good doctor. I know all about doctors.
Well --
He was a nice horse.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
I want it --
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I wanted to see the white horse --
A doctor?
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine? That'll keep. Sit down.
You will not have it?
Afraid of what?
Why don't you do it then?
Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife?
I've had some experience.
The same. Look here, Gray --
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
We have never been friends.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
I would make you rich.
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
What did you hear?
I know --
Now that is very interesting -- Take a chair, Joseph,
Only Brother.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
How long ago?
Three years.
She would if she could.
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Aye.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
We won't.
Dream on.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I think we should get some support?
What? Call the police?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
Good thing in a situation like this.
The scar.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Nobody.
How can you die if you're already dead?
You're him. Corvis.
I was talking about you.
I know her friends.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
Your father gave them to both of you.
How do you know?
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
No! Why are you haunting me?
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
Yeah, I know.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
Yes I do, I really do.
I don't want to see!
So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Shut up.
You know.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
You killed my daughter.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
But you, you've had them.
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Honey. I just can't.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Watch out!
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I don't believe you.
Please. Come inside.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
He'll be there at 8:30.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
That was my first question.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
I assure you such power exists.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Okay.
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Yes -- I think so.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Well, sure, but--
Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Goodnight.
I'll say goodnight again.
Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I don't believe it.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
You know about the United Nations?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I can judge only by what I see.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
I'm afraid my people haven't. I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Is it real?
Looks real to me.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Come on in.
What about him?
How do you know?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I see you for a minute?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
May I walk out with you?
Yes--?
I want to know what he told you last night.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention-- Bobby has such an active imagination.
What time is it?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons. I have a flashlight in my purse.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
I was.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How long will I live? That no one can say.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
I'd give you a very good price.
That's right.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Well, how do I know who you are?
You don't.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
You better get some fresh air.
Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Yeah.
He's a vampire alright.
He's my brother.
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine! Stay here!
We blew it, Edgar! We lost it!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Zero.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
That's just the way we like it.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
The baddest!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star. Climb on.
Star?...
You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up.
Good idea. Marko. We're hungry.
What?...
You're eating maggots. How do they taste?
Why? They're only noodles.
Get your bike. We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
With him?
Yeah.
No. Stick around.
Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
I will, David!
No, Star. Put it down. Put it down.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I can't do that!
How do you know they're not?
Hit the lights again.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. Let's stake 'em.
What?
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I'll take you there.
Okay, okay.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max? You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.
Good!
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I guess so. She said not to be late.
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
It was a dream, Star.
No, Laddie. It was a <u>memory</u>.
No. Just you.
I like Michael.
You better not like him too much.
For what.
For everything.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
No. I'm up.
Okay.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
We are...
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
Can't. Got plans of my own.
Michael!...
Get out, Mom! Run!
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later. Grandpa's expecting us.
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Soon.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Can we get a T.V.?
Soon as I finish this comic. Okay?
Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong? Tell me.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
In here?
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.
Okay. Have you been eating pizza? You smell like garlic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
C'mere, Nanook.
Must be a circuit breaker.
But, Mom...
There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't --
-- I'm not talking about Max! To hell with Max!
Mom!
What happened? Is everybody all right?!
-- a job.
Do I look that needy?
Hi, Thorn.
I know. It's so 'Eighties.' It's the Cute Decade.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Oh, right. I always gets those two confused.
Boy! <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!! I like garlic, but...
Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.
I hope so.
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Okay, Sam. Thanks.
Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing!
Well, I...
Did you want to talk to me?
Okay. Talk.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Star.
Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
Michael's great. I like Michael.
Okay.
Don't be a baby. That didn't hurt and you know it.
No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
Tonight. At the boardwalk...
Okay.
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
You're not going anywhere... Sam...
Take laddie.
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Okay. I'll flip you for it.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Nowhere.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No. Why?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
No. On the phone.
Don't bother.
Piss off.
You have such a great personality, Michael. You should open your own charm school.
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
What about Mom?
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
I don't know.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
The Marines.
Huh?...
I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
Just listen.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Dogs don't eat each other.
I know.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Maybe.
So what's our problem?
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
Anybody sick?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
I don't know who to trust.
What?
Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Ain't it there?
Don't walk behind me.
Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
No. Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Was dark... find a light...
You lying bastard...
I'm working it! Nothing's happening!
That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Cut him loose?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Childs, you got the torch? You get your ass in here!!
The dogs?
Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
That's good enough.
Probably the next meal.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
He's gone already! Do it!
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
Gee, thanks!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
What clothes?
You been made, MacReady.
What for?
For your health.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Then kill me.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We'll see. Let's try Clark.
Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece.
What do you mean "you think so?"
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Then we'll never make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Come on, Copper.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
All in Norwegian.
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms.
I guess I'm the only one.
I think so.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
Damn you, MacReady!
Thank you.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
In this weather?
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
A couple of hours.
Well, get to it.
A serum test possibly.
When was the last time you used it?
A day or so ago... I guess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
Started with six. There'd be four others left.
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
No.
I'll put this right through your head.
Don't let up, Childs!
Extinguishers.
I am going after them.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Damn if I won't.
One thousand volts. Should be enough.
Little over two hours.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Blair. He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on. Childs, come with me.
And that was enough?
Move it, Palmer.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is...
I ain't going with Sanchez.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
He's dead.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Can you think of any other tests?
Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
Why?
Just keep looking.
Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half...
What are you going to do? Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs. He's over.
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Position, my ass...
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.
What for?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
Right. Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
It's the generator I think! No power.
Well, let's get down there.
He's one of them.
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
What?!
It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
Can't hear you.
The journey is part of my work.
I had an accident.
I figured that. What kind of accident?
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
'Fraid so. Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy.
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
We're not supposed to think about it. But I dream about it sometimes...
Where?
The Hall of Books.
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
What happened?
No...
This is it?
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
How did you know?!
I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I am called Vox... ... Now you are Eloi.
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
I was lucky. The others weren't.
How have you survived so long?
Excuse me?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It frightens you.
Yes...
It was meant to.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes... Thank you.
Yes.
Do you know which way?
This way.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
How are your dreams now?
End...?
This has to end.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
What can I do? Tell me what to do.
I'm going to end it, Alexander. As we discussed...
I'll never forget this.
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Created?
You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
As slaves.
We make them see what we wish.
How?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
They survived above. Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that.
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.
So you take their best...
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
No...
No...
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
I'm a foolish man.
I know.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
And why not?
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Next time then. We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word... ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
Not here... alone. May we? Please?
All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Admiration? My my.
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Hold on... I know I have it...
A moonstone.
Your birth stone. I thought --
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Not here... alone. Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
All right...
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Shhh. Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I want to get into the light, that's all. Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
No, I'm fine. I'm... ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I've seen it.
Let them.
I have something for you...
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
God, and I'm running late --
What?
Nothing.
How romantic...
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
She's gotten into your equations.
Perseverance.
It hurt me, Alex. Very much.
Then why are you here?
I know that --
That's where you're wrong. I will change it.
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room?
You're dying here. Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Good night, Alex.
His home.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Yes...
Thank you.
Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
He's gone to a better place.
What makes you say that?
Then you can speak slowly.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
Why would you do that?
Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well.
I will...
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
Yes.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams? That's incredible.
We share everything.
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
Yes.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
I mean, why do you do it? What purpose does it serve?
You liked it there.
Oh, it was... ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Orion's belt...
You know this?
You lost someone.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
If you only knew...
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
I could...
Please, I beg you. Take him away from here --
Mara...?
No!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Do you have it?!
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Very good. Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
I did...
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
New Yorkers.
He said he traveled for two months.
I took a different route.
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Of course. You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
I suppose so.
We don't know.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back.
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We are what we are.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world.
Dean Fulton...
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
What's it like where you come from?
I am. Are you a climber?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
For our sake, I hope not.
No, sir.
I'm fine.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Depends on what you're seeing.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
Temporarily.
My business?
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
How?
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Sure.
Good.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
[Beat] Thank you.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Why?
Just do it.
You two ok?
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Beat] What?
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
How?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
Yeah.
After I...
What?
Yes.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
William, you're not making sense.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
To the hospital.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Then, where are you going?
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
Ok.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I'm doing fine.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Why?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
[Beat] We will.
I'll die either way.
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
2004.
The future doesn't look different?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
Maybe.
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
Yeah.
You have nothing to fear, William.
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Good.
Don't you go to jail for that?
I wasn't talking about anything.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Beat] How do you know?
The Jacket.
Why?
Is it true?
No.
Where are you going?
Sure.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Good.
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Sure.
Thanks.
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
You remember it?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
What.
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
What?!
You want anything special for dinner?
See ya.
What?
Go fuck yourself.
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
On what?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Aw, God.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
You know what? You're starting to irritate me.
Has anybody asked his wife? She's the one I hope did it.
You girls are in some hot water.
Yes, sir. I know.
Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
How are things goin' out there?
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though. You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
You want to come on in?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Just some young guy. Around twenty years old. Dark hair.
It's him.
Oh, great.
A .38.
Right. Where are they?
My Lord.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay. I'm married, too.
Shut up.
Human nature. I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Thelma? It's me.
Wait...! Um, where ya going?
I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
That's lonely for you, I guess. I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope. I've never robbed a bank.
What?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
You're a little angle, you are.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer. Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
I always knew that.
A regular outlaw.
Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
Louise, honey... Where are you? You sound funny.
Are you in town? This sounds long distance.
Christ, sure... yes!
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Not yet.
Call me back.
Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.
I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you, okay?
Okay.
No, honey. I told him I was buyin' a car. What is it for?
Peaches.
What?
That's the code word. I miss you, peaches.
Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
Can we get another room? Just put it on my credit card.
Who is it?
It's me.
Maybe.
Alright, alright. I'm sorry.
Maybe.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Oh yeah.
Yes.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Front.
Am I in trouble?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
I'll call you right back.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
In case of what?
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Isn't this fun?
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Well, just relax, will ya. You're makin' me nervous.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Get the car.
Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
Get the car!
West. Left.
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
All of it. That he tried to rape me.
Yes.
It means shut up, Thelma.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Hmmm. We gotta get some money.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
I think better when I drive.
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
But you think he fools around.
I don't know. I won't be.
Louise.
What did Darryl say?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
He's a real piece o' work. I wish you could meet him.
Thelma kinda took to him.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Have another drink, Thelma.
Nothing. It got messed up.
Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Don't worry about it. You want anything?
No.
What happened?
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Now you get a grip, Louise! Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Well, I just...
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!
Yes! I believe I am!
Try to.
Litterbug.
They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't! We got away! We were walkin' away!
Why not?!
Let's get it over with.
What.
I... I...
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Yeah.
Before.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Like a Chihuahua?
Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Gosh. It sure is.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
Well, you got it now.
We should have just ignored him.
Nothing. It's not funny.
What? What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
What?! What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Thelma!
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Hit it.
Yes.
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.
Are you alright?
What'd I say again?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Whatever.
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
What do you mean?
Eeuww.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
Me too. I feel awake.
Good.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club Med.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
Pass him!
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
What?
We've gone insane.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
Did you see that guy?! He was right in the middle of the road!
What?!
What?! What d'you think?!
Oh.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You're crazy.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
How do you stay so positive?
What?!
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
Way up ahead!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
All this for us?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
Go?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah. I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
Fuck you.
Hi there! You alright?
We're fine! How are you?
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Yeah... sure did.
Damn. I hate that! I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
So you admit it?
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
You sent that?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's he like?
Never?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Never met him.
What?
Well think about it.
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
People get hurt that way.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Out getting coffee.
Who?
Mary.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Call you back.
'That right?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
You got a brew?
No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Thanks.
Big time.
I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Yep.
Dumbshit.
You said it, mister. I gotta go.
Thanks.
No thanks.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Thanks.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
Here you go. What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
A fucking moron.
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Sure.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Any idea where I might start looking?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You don't buy what?
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Really? Very, very?
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Good good.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
You're a sick man, you know that?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Harvard?
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Fucking sickening.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?
He's no Steve Young.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Healy.
Why?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Oh Jesus...
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
You betcha!
Who's that?
And did everything -- ?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Hm?
On your ear, you've got something.
Oh great, I ran out.
No short game.
Twenty-two.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
That's more like it. Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Toy poodle!
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
Go!
Okay.
You're Woogie?
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
Really.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
It.
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
I think a little of both.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, that's really unneces --
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What do you mean?
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
I wasn't trying --
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
So what's up?
Eh.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Giddy-up.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
What --
Yes.
Tomorrow...
Where the hell are you?
Then you'll call, right?
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Something your father would've come up with.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
What does the letter say?
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Smoke.
Just wanted to see for myself. They're burning their documents.
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
I think it's a bad idea.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes it is.
Yeah.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
Says what, Kenny?
This is from the Highest Authority?
Time is of the essence.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Still heading for Cuba.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
This is about Cuba.
Dean Rusk!
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Yeah.
I, uh...
What about you? Where are you going?
Back to work.
No you weren't.
I was, you bastard.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Not as far as the election goes.
Good.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
No way.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Damn right I'm scared.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
I see.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
James Looks Twice?
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
Who are you?
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh... Ray... Little Weasel.
What journey?
Tell him, Ray.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Seven.
Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Beats the hell outta me.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
I already did.
Good.
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Go ahead.
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
Cooch. You're my hero.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
I gave it back to her.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Thanks, Cooch.
And get rid of the dog.
She's that subtle?
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Cuz I want New York.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
You're steppin' on sign.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
His spiritual mother...
Let's go.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He knows me?
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
He said he doesn't know.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
He saw an owl.
Grandpa traded with me. Goodbye.
A what?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Likewise.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Nothin'. Forget it.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Stop.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
So they took care of Leo.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ray.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're going for The Stronghold.
We're in there. We're in there --
You didn't have another vision...
That's right. Turn around.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
I desecrated it?
Go ahead, Ray.
Never mind.
I read, Cooch.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
No, that was Leavenworth. This -- was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
And on to a bigger one with you?
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I heard of one once.
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
How did you know this was my car?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
That's all!
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
It's classified.
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
On his six.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I was inverted.
Two miles.
Two meters.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would?
And far too aggressive.
It is combat. Every second counts.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Apology acknowledged.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Um. You.
There you go with those moves again.
Too aggressive?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
The what?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What are you talking about?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Harmless!
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What about the plane?
What plane.
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
Anything.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
It's not suffering anymore.
You're horrible
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
About as much as they think about killing me.
What?
Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.
Anything.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
I'm still second best.
You ever fly an F-14?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Why, what's gonna happen?
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Not to me.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
I want it back.
What?
Yesterday.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
Hardly ever.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
I like to play "reality".
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
How does it go?
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
And that's one!
Your watch.
Who's gonna win?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
I was, later.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
How could you?
Well what?
I live here, remember?
Right on the flight line?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Well?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Yes sir!
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
ROGER, COUGAR. Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
YEAH, COUGAR?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What? What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
NO. NO GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Okay, okay.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
Okay.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
I'm not losing it again!
280, 290, 300 knots.
3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Well what?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Got you here.
The list is long, but distinguished.
So's my Johnson.
This is Maverick.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Right.
I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation.
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Let's go. Eject.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
Don't.
Was.
Skipper, you can't do this!
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's because you don't have any women.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
What now?
He won again.
GOT 'EM.
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
GET LOST!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
IT'S MY SHOT.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
LOOK OUT!
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
No. You can be mine!
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Nope.
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
But you continued to fight.
Tell me one thing.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
Some guys never get it back.
Three guesses.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
How's it goin', Coog?
Me?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
The wings..
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
A good man. Good flyer.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
All right.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
No bother.
I called your house.
My wife's house.
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
You may not think so, but you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
You got the job.
What was that? An accident?
Oh, the usual. More money, more freedom, more air.
The Last Resort.
You're getting off to an early start.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.
What happened to them?
Cheap domes. And no air to screen out the rays.
Why not?
Take me to the hotel.
The Last Resort! Quick!
Whatcha doin' to me, man?! I got six kids to feed!
But maybe you can change all that.
I think my grampa might be here.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Who are you?
I'd advise you to hurry.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Definitely.
Get it, please.
Identification?
Thank you.
May I use your pen?
Fuck you.
So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help. Benny here...
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
I know that.
But I thought...
Great! Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
They've got Quaid! They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it.
Yes, sir.
Don't be an idiot.
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
You better get down here.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.
I've been trying to tell you. Someone erased his memory.
Nice to meet you.
Don't you keep up with the news? We're doing alien artifacts now.
Eight years.
I see. Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Not really. I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Hmmm. And how do you like your women?
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
I'm quite serious. You're not here, and neither am I.
At Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
That's right.
No need to be rude. I'll do it.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Where?
There! The woman!
Arrest that woman!
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Relax, you'll live longer.
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Yeah.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
What, aliens?
You tell me.
I don't know.
Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him.
C'mon!
Melina!
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
"RekallRekallRekall." You thinkin' of goin' there?
Well don't.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
No shit...
Don't fuck with your brain, pal. It ain't worth it.
Harry!
How was your trip to Mars?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway.
What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!
Are you crazy?! I don't know anything about Mars.
Up to the right.
I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got Quaid.
Level 2. Galleria.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
What is it?
I've got him. The guy in the turban.
Split up. Find him.
Up!
Come on!
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened. You got it.
Drive! DRIVE!!
Anywhere! Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Mmmm.....
Poor baby. This is getting to be an obsession.
The brunette. The one you told me about.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Nobody.
Nobody?! What's her name?
I don't know.
Tell me!
But I'm always home by morning.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Move to Mars.
Just think about it.
And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.
Lori, move.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
I'm late.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No! Spies or something. And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars? You've never even been to Mars.
Let me finish!
What did they do to you? Tell me!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
They did! But I killed them!
Doug...
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
Implanted.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Bullshit.
Beats me. I just work here.
It's time you found out.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
Yeah. Some of it was fun.
I'm here at Rekall.
Right. That's why you tried to kill me.
Doug, don't!
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Mars.
Right. Mars.
That a problem?
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
As real as any memory in your head.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What's he talking about?
Let me go!
I love you.
Blondes.
I think it's still hungry.
I guess he didn't.
You couldn't get me a message? You never wondered what happened to me?
There's something I have to tell you...
What are you talking about?
I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't even remember me.
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser? You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside.
Inside what?
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Get out!
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you. Come on!
Jump!
I used to model for 'em, why?
Just wondering.
I'm not a hooker! That's my cover.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear? What do you think?
The reactor.
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
People are dying, Quaid!! Stop!! We've got to get air!!
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
It's just up ahead.
Of course not. If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
I gave you?
I'm leaving it here. Come get it and keep moving.
What?
...Who are you?
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to something.
That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Roger that.
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
I don't know... They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
My cannon.
Phone's out. Road's out. We're on our own.
I think I scared it!
I'd go for penetration. The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Burt, can you hear me now?
In a minute.
Damn it! They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Right. We're gonna run. Get ready.
Well, who put you two in charge?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
No good. You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP! THEY'RE COMING! DON'T MOVE!
No. We go straight.
Could we make it to the mountains?
Nope, there! That's one.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet. You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs. I did eggs.
Hell you did. Your turn.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
The new one! That's supposed to be a girl!
Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Forget it, man. It's not worth it.
Damn straight! Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
What the hell is going on? I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah! Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Screw you. For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
The rifle.
Great. Thank you.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Oh shit!
Sons of bitches!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
You got <u>that</u> right!
Yeah. Where's your truck?
Little sons of bitches.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Fuck you, too. Pardon my French.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.
Right. We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
We need another plan.
Jesus. It's slower than hell.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons. No way they could stop it.
Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
We got a plan!
Like hell you are.
Get real. I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one. We can't kill them all.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
Sell the movie rights. We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
No ties.
She just practically asked you for a date. What the hell is wrong?!
She likes <u>both</u> of us. We both helped her out.
You are so full of shit...
She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday.
You bet.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
They're tearing down the houses here! We all gotta get outta here together! Now!
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning. The concrete blocks are in.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
What?
It's...gone...!
Am I sure?! It was right there. There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Could be.
You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off.
I didn't do it! What's going on?
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, geography.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah. One, two, three...
It does.
Why do you all keep asking me?
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We need a decoy.
Good point.
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
He was your snitch.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
True.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I have to talk to your brother.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Let go of my hair.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
So noted.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
I can describe it.
Oh really?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Ah.
No further questions.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Not at all --
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!
Of course.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Right. You're right.
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- a speed manufacturer --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
What other case?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
"Have to"? No...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
-- You found his mugshot?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
-- Yeah?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Roger Baron.
-- What?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. Nice.
...What do you mean?
-- Eddie...
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
-- Roger -- ?
What's Art Esparza?
I followed her from the courthouse.
I've seen this picture before.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
-- Me? Neither.
Neither.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
You're doing a murder case?
It hasn't been that long.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I embroidered.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I lied.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I haven't paid you.
Right.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
EXACTLY!
I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Screw you too, Kitty.
That's right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
...Okay...
"Painted"?
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
"No," what?
It's okay, Eddie.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
No, s-sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Don Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
That's right.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Badgering.
-- in a context.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
Shouldn't one of us...?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
-- What trial?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
That's right.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
-- Roger --
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Yeah, we do some of that.
What is your rank within La Compania?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars... PCP, crack...
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That's right.
Soldado.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
Albert.
What color hair will she have?
Blonde.
Tell me some other things about her.
I want you.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit... We killed a guy for baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Bobby...
Thanks, Bobby. And my little round friends, too.
Out back in our morgue.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yep, it sure is.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Okay, Gordon!!!
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
What?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You are here and there is no place to go...
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
No. Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Say no more.
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
How do you figure?
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
What do you mean?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
It's late, Sam.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
Yes, he is like a clown.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Noooo...
Thanks.
When?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is? You're just too adorable...
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Of course...
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
No, I want to smoke.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
No place, fast. And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Dancing.
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Not you, Donna, not you.
No, you should forget about last night.
Laura, I am your friend.
No.
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Cause I like it.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep... Yes... It is.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Who would do that?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
No... No...
Oh, yes... yes...
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Hey, Jacques...
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
And what a muffin you have.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
Let's go all the way.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Okay.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.
We were supposed to be together.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
James...
When am I going to see you?
Not now.
This afternoon?
Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
I do love you. Let's get lost together.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
Bobby killed a guy.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
You want to see...
See what?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
We throw away the whole head.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.
What?
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Fine.
School?
...school's fine...
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Not really.
Dad...
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
A friend from school.
A special friend?
No.
We're late to get to your mother.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you come home during the day last week?
No.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME. KILL ME.
Oh, Leland.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner. And look at this.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Who am I?
I don't know.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
What did you say?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Ah. How did they treat you?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Gruber...
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
It's a crime.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...I was one of a group of...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Tell us.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand...
We just...
It was good of you to meet...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I... um...
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
I'm sorry...?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four. You're great with these kids.
You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Exception!
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
Is this a bad time.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I... do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
No... no...
Yes. We've all got to let go.
No.
What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked.
It's locked?
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Yes.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Thanks, Franky.
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...?
Uh...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...now who is that...?
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Admittance form is wrong.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Yeah.
You use their witness.
That's right.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Read me what she said.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh. And why is that?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Should I?
That won't start no more fires. We might's well go home.
Yeah. No sense stayin' out here.
Let's go.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, how about that!
Come on out! We're friends!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast. Anything from them yet?
All right - I've seen enough!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
There's nobody left around here now.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics. He knows all about meteors!
Why, sure -- I got it! Do you have a match?
I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
What's he like?
Like...ah...
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Sure...get in!
It's gone now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus. I haven't any family.
I come from a big one. Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses. They'll be stopped -- somehow!
Hours. I've been so scared...!
It was... ...one of them!
What was it like?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe ... Maybe they want to take us alive.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one. You know why?
Yes ... Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
You'll be all right with us.... ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Have you got a pocket compass?
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
We better get word to the authorities and -- Look!
It might give us something.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
No. I thought you had them.
Right.
Looks like the fishing was good.
So is the town, I notice!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
It's always been a good persuader.
It was nearer than that.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help. Over.
Who? Where d'you think they come from!
How would I know...!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Welcome to California!
Sure, sure! Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.
He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.
Can I read it?
Sort of a trial balloon.
So I don't know about horror.
Come on. Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
We'll work something out. I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
I don't know. A couple months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
I don't follow.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
No biggie, really.
I'm sorry. At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
48 hours. Back before you know it.
Chase. Hi...
Chase, you'd better come home.
What? What kind of episode?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
I'll be there in three hours.
Don't speed, Chase. It's not...
No.
Diabetes?
No.
Absolutely.
Is he all right?
These look quite fresh.
Get her back! I've got to go in! Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp. For Dylan's sake.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand. If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
What?
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.
What?
Bye.
Rex? Who's Rex?
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
No. Tonight. It's important!
They were safe and could sleep.
The mean old man with the claws.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.
Not sleepy.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home, that's right.
Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is, sweetie. We'll both go get Rex right now.
Coming for you...
Here.
A story?
Read me some?
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
You didn't jump in.
That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.
Seemed, not was.
It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
Steady...
John. It's Heather. I need help!
You got it. What's happening?
Where's Dylan?! Have you seen him?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
I'm afraid there was an accident. It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.
You're kidding, right?
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Dunno. Just have this feeling today...
They wouldn't let me...
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Captured? How?
Then what is he doing?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
You know damn well it's more than that now! How can we stop him?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
Do you let your child watch your movies?
My child? No...but...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
No time like the present. The car will bring you.
Now?
Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Coffee'd be nice.
Me too.
Not yet.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Yep.
Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You miss him.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
I can take it.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew. That's why he came.
We were idealists.
Phil, he's not looking inside. He's just striking out at the world.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight! Hey! Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
Good. Let's go sailing.
I didn't know sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everybody down! ON THE DOUBLE!!
Yes sir.
North, north-east. And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Thank you.
You came back, Tod. You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.
Yes sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Okay.
All right. I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Yeah.
Rick March. Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
To take a piss.
What?
Believe what?
Her name. Bregitta. It's poetry.
Yeah. How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
I know.
Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else.
What?
Anonymous.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Me either.
I feel like... we can do anything.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
Because it looks good.
He does.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
It was a bad dream...
Shut up, Phil.
Like this!
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
I guess.
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
I know enough.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know? Bein' here together an all...
We all have problems.
I'm pissin' fire man.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Yes.
Passport?
Look, I just better go.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I can't watch this.
Fine.
Good.
Forget it.
It doesn't matter. Really. I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. Who wants to know?
Come on man, what'd they look like?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
How do you know? They might.
Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world'.
My dad.
It works?
Who?
I couldn't.
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
Yes sir.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
All stop on the engine.
It was my fault. I slipped.
Face what?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
Sir...?
Close the door. Sit down.
He killed the dolphin.
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
It's his father sir. He's suffocating him. We've all seen it...
I don't know.
You should tell him. That's something he can take with him.
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
That is unfortunate. We'll have to take him with us.
Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?
No.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas.
I know.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Take good care of my son.
He's a big boy.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me. Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
No. Look, it's me okay? Can't it just be about me? For once?
It's okay. I'll be in, in a minute. Look, what do you want?
You do?
Yes. I do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
I'm sorry, Skip. It's this damned book. Lawford gave it to me.
We're short one long boat too. Come on.
A padlock.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
They'll know about it in the morning.
She's Cuban.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
We'll think of something.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go! Lemme go!!
Why'd you jump?
Because I felt like it. What do you care?
I couldn't do it.
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Trust me donut. I know.
What? Come on...
I figured it out.
Okay donut. Whatever you say.
I don't have to listen to this.
You will if you wanna eat. Right George?
If it were only that simple, my young friend. Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Read on, young John. Read on. College boards are coming.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
It seems we're short on singers.
Outer.
Barometer's dropping. The first blow'll come from the south. Might get interesting.
What's that?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
No. Bring him on deck with the others.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
What?
No, Phil. It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
About anything.
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil. Not like this.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Come on man. Let's just talk about it.
No.
Then keep your mouth shut.
Excellent. Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
You already have. Now go on. Do it.
What?
Up you go. Right now.
I'm sorry...
Sorry won't cut it.
I don't know...
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall". With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
May I ask you something?
It wasn't hard.
I used to helm a school ship. A long time ago.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'. She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No. I didn't.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
Everybody knows why she went over Tod. You jibed the boat.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
This be it?
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
How old are you?
Twenty.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Fuck me.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
Sorry to hear it.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
No.
You an indian?
No.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Ready for another?
Why not?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
Have now.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
Forty bucks...
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Used to.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Thanks.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Set one up.
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Muchas gracias.
Whattaya do there?
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Come here.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
In many capacities.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Hasta siempre.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em... Now tell me...
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
This 'bout the fifth time?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You won't of missed much.
See ya downstairs.
What I made you do, mama?
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
And?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
No, he picked me up.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
What's that?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
So?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
Yeah, maybe...
You up for that?
I guess.
We got through two states already.
What kinda trash talk is that?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
What's that, honey?
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
It's just another case, Sailor.
What's that, peanut?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
You certain?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Who do?
You do.
Where?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I'm goin'.
Who knows, baby?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
We'll find out in a hurry.
Uh huh.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Under a hundred.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
They have, sugar.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
What's that?
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
One bad car accident...
SAILOR!!!
You think she's gonna make it?
I'm afraid she is, baby.
No radio or TV...
Fan works.
Now what?
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Sailor?
Yeah?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
The only one.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Come sit by me.
I'll come along.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Love you, too.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What?
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What makes sense, is all.
SAILOR!!!!
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Six.
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
Yes.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You need to explain it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Santos...
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
In the head.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back.
What?
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
Shhhhhh... Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
No.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So?
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Thanks...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
So I hear.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
He's right, you look horrible.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
You're welcome.
How are you, Crabtree?
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's a transvestite.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
Isn't she?
I thought you were tinkering.
I just mean...
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He finished it Winter Break.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Not Curtis.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Where would we go?
Shit.
Tripp, where the hell...
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Maybe... I don't know.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Which is?
Competence.
What's to tell?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
So sensitive.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Ye-es?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently. Coming!
Find the jacket.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Such as.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Call it a hunch.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
That was MacCaulay.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
He was never able to reproduce them.
In a sense.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
No. But I don't think that matters.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that.
I peeked.
Excuse me?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
It's mine.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit.
You did.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Do you think that's why I've been having these... ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And your wife left you.
Is that in my chart?
Her dog, yes.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Relax, Vernon...
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
No, really...
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Shoot.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
With Emily?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Yea?
...You carry firearms.
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really? That's remarkable.
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
You're right.
I'll miss my bus.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
So I'm told.
Really?
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
Yea, James.
What are we going to do with...
I've got tenure.
Miss Sloviak's.
Can I ask you something about her?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Is he all right?
What's he saying?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
You're welcome.
I put you on the floor.
Oh.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Sure.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd he say?
Yes.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?
Blocked.
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Hm.
How did I get here last night?
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
The bus station.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Who?
I don't know... Me.
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, actually...
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Where's that?
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Amazing.
Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend?
Because of my coat?
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I never said that.
In a minute. Get us a table.
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
I eat.
When?
When nobody's looking.
Okay.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Near Carvel?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Yes, James.
Even if I end up going to jail....
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James'll know about George Sanders.
Do?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
That strikes me as odd.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Oh. Well. I...
Grady!
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
But where? I need the street.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
It beats 'What's your major?'
That good, huh?
No, it's not that, it's...
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
I got the message you called too.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
She's left before...
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Hm.
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Neither do I.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Did you confess?
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
That... and you.
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
And you're old.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Some times...
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Why yes. How did you know?
Lucky guess.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
James is... I don't know...
Sure it is.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
What's that?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Yes?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Taking the long way home.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I was thinking of you.
And?
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
No, the dog.
Just kidding.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt it, darling.
If he's happy... I'm happy.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I like the noise.
What?
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It's a nice table.
Yeah. It's really nice.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
You need a table.
Then what? What?!
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
The birthday party.
No thanks.
Ah, come on.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
What's that?
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Early July.
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Sure.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I mean... feelings.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Sure.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's just a city park.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I can't.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I'm not pretty.
Well... not in the common way.
Robin.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
Yeah.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Okay.
What?
Yes.
Do you believe in them?
No.
Neither do I. What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
I don't know.
What?
The girl.
Know what?
I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I was asleep.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
'Fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Yeah.
You are in.
What?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Why's that?
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Can I ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
No.
How come?
Banished... yeah.
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Does he?
Yes.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I can't.
Yes you can, Robin.
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
I know because... it's just something I know.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
I said the job is okay.
That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
It's all the same.
What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I don't understand.
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
It's okay.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Honest? No.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Forget it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
You have no feelings for your niece?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
I don't.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
You don't know!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
I don't know!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Go home, Walter.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
I see my sister.
Not so fast.
Sorry. Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Where are you?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there. We're taking a nap.
A nap?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
All right.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Nothing.
I'm only asking questions.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
You felt pleasure.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I meant later... when you two took naps.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Time.
How do you feel about that?
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
Sorry.
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
I like the noise.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
What?
You're damaged.
Yeah?
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
What?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
Not tonight.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
No you're not.
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
Hi.
Because I like you.
The worst?
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How many girls did you molest?
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
No. Never again.
You don't really --
Yes! I want to know.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.
Bullshit.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
The percentages --
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Not ever.
What?
Us seeing each other.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what I meant.
Fine.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Prove it.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Do you want to talk about it?
I need a shower.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Piece of cake, baby.
Where're you?
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
No way that could just be seawater.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone.
What is that? You drop your dive light?
How deep's the drop-off here?
Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
No! I'm okay now. I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston.
My rig. I designed the damn thing.
Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You--
Not for long.
Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Who else?
Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.
What happened?
Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
Fine. Be that way.
No.
Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...
His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!
Cute, Virgil.
Yeah? Well I'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Lindsey! Wait a second--
Chill out, Lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Not in this thing.
Yeah. So sue me.
You noticed.
Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this--
Wonderful. There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.
Calm down, Bud.
How?
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
Aaargh!! I'm freezing!
No way! Forget it. Not an option.
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
FUCK LOGIC!!
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
Who then?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
No.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Check. Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Everything is.
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
Do we just leave him there?
Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.
Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
All right. Do it!
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
We're here now. Let's get her done.
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all.
Missed what?
Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non- human, but intelligent...
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Turn it up, bozo.
Just checking is out, huh? How come?
Give me that!!
Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
He's hallucinating badly.
Through three miles of water? I don't know.
She'll wait.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Wait for what?
A little more so this time.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
I'm thirsty.
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Four or five days.
You already know what they are.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
That must be Basiluzzo.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Well, what?
Have you decided?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
That seems to apply to you also...
How should I be ... arrogant?
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
No.
But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes, maybe that is better.
Yes.
Then I'll go with you.
Yes, you should go.
But then when will we see each other?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
So, you wonder why?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
No reason why...
Aren't you going to change?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
Late, very late.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Have you ever been in love?
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
To do what?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It was futile. We went all over.
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Who's moving?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
We'll try again.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Yes, yes, of course.
Ask her.
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Why don't you try?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I appeal to you more?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Unfortunately, no.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And how come you're up so early?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Yes, we will.
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
You're kidding!
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Agnes...
I'm a blimp.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Who tells you these things?
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
It made them holy.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I burnt them.
Why?
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
Yes.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
God! But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
You've been alone together?
Yes.
Often?
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Yes I do, but I want you to...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
What?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Where did you go?
You have trouble sleeping?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not? Mmm?
She'd get angry.
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Is that what she said?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
I'm not sick.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
And you're unhappy.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
Answer me! You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
I breathed!
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
She can't hurt you any more.
She can.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She...
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
Oh, yes.
And then...
What?
Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.
Alright.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow? Do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish... ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Someone's following me.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
What else?
A crucifix.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
I don't know which one
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Yes.
What did she mean?
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
Why?
So I could go to him.
Who?
Him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do?
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Sister...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Something they... that they overlooked.
What? You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything I'll call you.
What about Roger? He's free.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Why? You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
I can get you new evidence next week.
No!
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
What does this have to do with..?
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why haven't you asked her?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
That possibility never occurred to you?
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Answers.
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes.
Take at look at it.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
What sheets?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
About what?
Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know...
Oh, God.
I'd like yours too.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
I know you don't.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.
And what has that to do with it?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
Would you like one? Huh?
I'd love one.
All right?
Fine thanks...
Long, thin and filtered.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become? One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
No.
Of course.
Then let's begin.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
You're what?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How ?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
That's what I have to believe...
Somebody told her.
Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what? An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
No!
You tied the cord around its neck.
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
I bet you're -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
Read 'em!
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Yeah.
Sixpence.
The police station.
He'll be pulp by now.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
They'll be here.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Well!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Sorry?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
No. I don't.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Grotty?
Yeah, grotesque.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I don't care.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
Have I said something amiss?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
It is, y'know.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Ah well. Eh, look!
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
You crawler.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Sorry.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
He comes from a large family.
Follow your impulse.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
I see. Do you like the play?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
What are you?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
See you.
Of course.
Parading's better!
Parading?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
What's that mean?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What?
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
He can talk then?
I'll look after meself.
Every morning.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...
Oh, well that's all right. What?
Yeah ... so what?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Here, Pauly.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
What little old man?
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Foreign devil ...
So's mine.
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
He started it.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
No.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now!
Come on speedy!
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Sit down, the lot of you.
You wouldn't!
I would though.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Oink! Oink!
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew I could rely on you.
Thanks.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
Since you ask, yes. Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aye, I suppose so.
Aren't we ...
No, we're not!
Don't start. Look.
Sorry.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Good lad, Ringo.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
That's too easy for Lennon.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
Nerves.
I know, that's the trouble.
Clever. George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
You were twanging too loud.
Get knotted!
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
A proper Aborigine.
Well, he can't stop here.
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
Yeah, it's you all right.
Cattle ranch!
Kill drive engines.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800. 700. Hang on gentlemen.
Or something will be able to see us.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
... I don't know...
Do you remember the pyramid?
No. Just some horrible dreams about smothering. Where are we?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah. Two hours.
Gravity?
Point eight six. We can walk on it.
It's... basalt. Rock.
Then take her down.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Receiving.
Looks like a derelict.
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
Take a look.
You want to try?
Sure.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Can you see anything in the hole?
Take care.
Yeah, but this is hard work. Can't talk now.
Wretched. What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name.
God I'm hungry.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
A voice transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Unknown.
What? <u>Why</u>?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Right. Talk to you.
Yeah!
How's it coming on the engines?
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What do you mean?
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Dead.
Dead!
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
It's still in the ship?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt! How?
Is it alive?
What was that? What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.
Here, let me try.
What?
The engines are fixed.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I hope not.
Poison gas...
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Right.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Right.
And be right back.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How does he breathe?
Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are blocked.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Boy, that's terrific.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
It wouldn't come.
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
The door was closed. It must still be in here.
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.
Good.
How do we locate the creature?
Got a better idea?
At least it can't get up here now.
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
It's time for drastic remedies.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I can't, the acid will pour out!
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
How many?
Three blips! They're coming this way!
Jay, this is Cleave! Meet me at the main air lock!
I guess I had it coming. Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey! what about the film?
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken.
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
Feast your eyes.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
You lead.
My signal's fading.
How far?
We should be almost on top of it. I just can't quite...
Who knows?
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
No, it's coming.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
What is it?
Let's let the machine work on him.
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
We're going into the freezers now.
Maybe we could write it together.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Are they close?
They're on the next level up.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second. Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Close...
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Yeah?
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere. Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Good! Moisture content?
Zero. Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one. It's dead.
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
Good. I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Found what?
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft. We're going to approach it.
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
But?
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?
Oh well... you know me.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin. If something worries you, it worries me.
Tell you what, Martin. As soon as the engine's fixed --
Yeah, we hear you! We're coming back!
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him. Let us in.
Good.
Is that its mouth?
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week. It's plenty of time.
We've got it up here! It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
I guess we open the door and net it.
Go ahead, Jay.
What do you think? Now we go in.
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
Look...
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
Kill me...
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Sure.
It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Do you want a tablet?
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking. It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Is it dead?
No, it's still breathing. Kinda clammy though. Are you sure your stick's not broken.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
I told you we... what's that?
Bloody big if it is. Top's open.
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control. What are you going after, rhino?
Oh man...
Yep...
Better tell the boss.
Okay, give me the numbers.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
It's on the board.
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
We're what!?
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
What? What's wrong? What is it?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Get her on-line. Now!
Keep trying!
Shit. When?
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Do it.
About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this.
That's what I mean. This is the quietest I've ever heard it. It's unnatural.
Yeah?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
I dunno.
What?
Take a look at this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
That's a fact.
What?
Just got a reading...
I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
Forget it, man.
C'mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.
Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?
I'll come with you.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
It's moving slow. About... eleven metres. On the left.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
Just behind us, over to the right.
Yeah, I...
How?
I dunno. Might be a glitch.
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Couple more seconds!
Thanks.
York just turned up outside. We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Uh-huh.
What's the problem?
Appreciate that.
And, nothing. They checked out just fine.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Done it already. Nothing matches.
Just give them the facts. They can leap to their own conclusions.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Compensate!
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Looks like it.
Right. Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
No, not really. More sort of the 'claustrophobic' type.
Is that a fact.
Four.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
What do you mean?
Again? How long before we start noticing the difference?
I'm out of ammo. Get inside, get inside!
Detour. Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
You have to...
No!
Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
You got it, cowboy.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Please do.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Eddie what?
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just like that.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
It wasn't meant to be.
D-day.
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Aren't you?
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Stars.
Almost four.
Why not?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
We're?
Lloyd and I.
What else?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You have no right to say such things!
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Yes, you did. You still do.
Champion to champion.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
You're being childish.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
A happy coincidence.
Margo? Lunching in public?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
She may be later than you think...
We have that in common.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Amen.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Everything... everything's so funny...
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Where's my coat?
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I told her. I sounded off.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
When - when are you coming back?
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
She did...?
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
What?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
See you...
It won't play.
Cut it out.
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
You wouldn't understand. How was Miss Caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Don't mix your metaphors.
I mix what I like.
Okay. Mix.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
What a body, what a voice.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I'm trying terribly hard.
Paranoiac!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Then what would be enough? If we were married?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
You were great.
Glory Hallelujah.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
Yes, dear.
You know what I'm going to be?
A cowboy.
A married lady.
With the paper to prove it.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
So am I.
What have I got to do with it?
Everything.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali. Good luck.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
You hear all kinds of things.
No thanks, Birdie.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
But she just got here...
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Oh, brother.
Oh, brother.
Miss Coonan...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
See you home...
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Well?
Hmm?
You don't like Eve, do you?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
How do you mean that?
My back's open. Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
That's all.
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
Probably not.
It was for my report.
What report? To whom?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Don't bother.
Subway.
How long does it take?
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
I don't care if I never get home.
You rest. I'll get it...
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
Not at all.
He's the best.
Oh, no...
She's got to meet you-
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Not at all. Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
My husband...
Try...
Well...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
I'd like that.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Hollywood.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
Of course.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Please...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
Don't get up. And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
There can't be very much-
Oh, but there is-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Why shouldn't you? Please sit down.
I'm not crying.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
Something most important you can do.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Over my dead body...
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
'Remembrance'.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
I won't be a minute.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
No trouble at all.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
That's my job. See you at tea time...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I wouldn't like.
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
I had no idea you knew each other.
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
Harrington.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
It doesn't matter.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
Well...
About what?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
With tears.
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
You'll be there, won't you.
Loud.
In a minute...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
That's on time for Margo.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
It's just possible she didn't...
What is?
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
Eve.
Eve?
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
With gestures, of course.
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
... Among so many quiet qualities.
What is he talking about?
Up in the room.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
I will.
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
When's the audition?
A couple of weeks.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Would you?
Anything to help you out, Max.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Promise.
I promise.
That's my Max.
Are you breaking the contract?
Answer my question!
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I didn't hear you.
I said I'm a dying man!
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--mine's better--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing-- --did you call me a failure?
I was sure trying.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
And you haven't called him?--
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--you do?--with access to records?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Were you eyebrow reading?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
I never scared anyone before.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there. What do we know?
Anything you've got.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
We appreciate your position--really.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
When?
'68.
Nixon.
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people. OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--Colson.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I haven't said anything--
We're inside the White House now.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Who?
Haldeman.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though.
What's the matter?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Maybe we are...
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
11:30.
Morning or night?
Night.
Oh.
I'm on deadline.
Whatever.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--Howard Hunt?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
--Teddy Kennedy?
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
And you will. But not now.
He is not in the car. Sorry.
Well of course.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
That's right.
Mind if I try?
I've got a lot of energy.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
When did he hire you?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Tell that to Muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I didn't.
But you know who did.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--so?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
--that was awhile ago--
--yes--
We've just been talking to Young--
And?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--Deep Throat?--
Absolutely--
--what about you?--
Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. See?
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
I think.
Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
There's always a later plane.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
--you don't really think you're being followed?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Hey, easy...
We're a long way from high school, Carl... ...and I'm scared.
Just let me get a match.
--right, right, I've got to go. Why did you lie just then?
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
The ones who could disburse the money.
Who were they?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
To cover up?
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
I will not talk about the other two.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
--this'll only take one second--
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
My non-denial denial.
You asking me to disclose my source?
I don't know titles.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--what do you think?--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
Electronic surveillance.
OK.
Look, I told you inside--
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Where? What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Yes, sir.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
To where?
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Ratfucking.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Did you change cabs? It didn't work, something moved there--
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
There were more then.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty...
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
Will you step forward, sir.
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
The C.I.A.
--I'm Woodward.
Are you sure?
No.
Never? Please don't tell me never. Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
I couldn't say.
But it's possible.
It is.
I really want to know.
Nobody ever had too much.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Lotsa hints--
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
--well, Sloan--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--maybe I'm tense--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
Absolutely.
--can we use their names?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
He just did.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
Haldeman. Right?
I won't talk about the other two.
A girl. Melissa.
No, none of those.
Of course--everything they asked--
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well... It came from the heart.
Okay then. The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
What the fuck is this? You got someplace more important to be?
Sure.
Suck me...beautiful?
You need some work, buddy!
Like what?
Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Single malt?
Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Neither did I!
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
No idea.
Easy, tiger. What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience. You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on! I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
Yeah? Well you can't fake your way through this. You better practice.
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay. Cool then. I'm um, I'm glad you came by. I mean, really.
Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great.
So you're going to Michigan?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah. So what're you gonna major in?
Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No. I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
You called me Oz.
I know, it sucks!
Then don't.
Yeah right.
What? We both have cars.
Are you kidding? You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Of course.
Do you love her?
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding? No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
No, "Charming" is old. "Older" is <u>really</u> old. "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good. Breath check.
So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Right. That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No -- it's true. He is...really... big.
Yeah, enormous.
Went home to shit.
I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
I'll save you a seat.
Just in time.
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Come on, Jim. Where are you?
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I'm not going.
Yeah.
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
These are for you. From father to son.
Oh, okay. Here's let me show you.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
I know. Hey Nadia.
Okay, okay. I'll let you hit those books.
I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Yes. Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And...
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
Okay!
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
No -- Kevin, you?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade?
Oh that's really reassuring. And don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin. Vicky's looking for you.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
After getting laid?
After high school.
Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy. I am now a man.
I thought so.
Okay.
Me?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Do you mind? This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well. You have seen me. Now it is my turn to see you. Strip.
Yes, slowly.
For me?
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
I am sorry, Jim. I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time! Please vacate the room.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You think so?
You got in.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead!
How?
Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin. But I did pick it up from you.
Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
You want to do it?
Yes --
I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Kevin... I want to have sex with you.
No...I know the perfect time...
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay. Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
It did.
I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Your little pact. Jessica told me all about it. Way to go, Kev!
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
What? Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party.
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know...
What?! How do I do that?
Qualify for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
I don't care.
He didn't?
Yeah. So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new.
Bullshit. From where?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Shut the fuck up.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck -- ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Yep.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
Uhh! Would you die already!
Just like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
AHHHHHHH!
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
And who's Claude?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Andy!
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
What?! He told you? When?
Andy! No!
A cure?
Shit. What have I done? Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
What...?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Really.
What?
It's making me hungry.
Well, they are French.
Right.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
No... I...
Shit!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Before the coma!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
And you call me a moron...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Looks like he lied to you too.
What?!
Oh shit... No...
That's not all... Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Oh no... no....
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
What about me?
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
I told him it wasn't ready...
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
How well did, er, do you know him?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Now!
Yes sir.
He says -
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
Double merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I know, but I had to because . . .
When you're older . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
No. I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Then come find me.
Good day!
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
I'm fine.
Who's Sophie?
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Who are you?!
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
Trying... to... breathe...
Now just get off the train.
HUH?!
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
You are the Princess.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
The dessert fork!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
It's not you - it's the dress!
Sad?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I'm glad you did too.
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Yes, you do. You do.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
We will. We <u>have</u> to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
He's her?
Look!
Ew. . . the honest type.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
Are you feeling all right?
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
Rasputin!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Run, Anya - go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Remove him at once.
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
I should go
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
You gave the orders!
I did no such thing!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
What's your name?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
What's your name?
Come on.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
This guy's on television.
I need a large polo mallet!
You don't want my autograph.
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
It's for my brudder. Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
What?
This is Alvy Singer!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy Singer over here!
M'mm.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yes.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish! Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right. All right. All right.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Hey, that was last year.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
You-you play... very well.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Me? Oh, downtown!

Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.

Oh - you're an actress.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
No, Chippewa Falls.

Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, you do?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
Huh?
You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
You want your gear? Here you go.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh.

Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Okay.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen years?
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Neat, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Well, who's Sadie?
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Why not?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Well, uh... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

No, so help me.
it's my first time.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
No, I'm gonna quit!
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah!
Yeah?
It's terrific.
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
As Balzac said...
H'm?
"There goes another novel." Jesus, you were great.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No. You're a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Here, you want some?
I tried to take my pants off over my head... ...my ear.
What? What?
H'm?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah?
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah.
No, I'm serious. I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Do I love you?
That's the key question.
Yeah.
I know you've only known me a short while.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah... yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Don't you think I do?
I dunno.
Of course.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
No, I'm fine.
U-huh.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Let's just do it, all right?
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Yeah.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
David? You call your teacher David?
It's his name.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Yeah?
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
G-go on, I'm interested.
M'hm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't. I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Life. I said, "life."
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
Are you okay? What's the matter? Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Oooh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy?
What?
W-w-whatta you mean?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh, darn it.
What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
What... huh?
Check it out.
What thing?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing... ...yeah... yeah.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Nothing at all?
Yeah.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
I'm cool.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Oh-
This is the first book that I got you.
Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
What?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
No. Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
I'm late.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh!
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I did.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
I can't.
What-
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I can think of another word.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Yeah.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I mean that as a compliment.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
What are you depressed about?
It's a narrow view.
...as opposed to a print...
Yes.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
Right before his un-American thing.
Yeah, I love it there.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
You're crazy!
Stop calling me Max.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
You'll total the whole car.
We can show her the schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Look, uh...
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
M'hm.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
What difference does that make?
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Where?
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
And... uh-
How do you like this couple, Max?
Yeah. Right.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
We're gonna operate together.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
His wife has diabetes!
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
SO?
So the colored have enough trouble.
She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I look pretty.
Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Yes, I do.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
We're going to take them to the airport.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, gosh.
I really enjoyed it. Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
I don't know. I don't know.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Yeah.
And here, you just-
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
To code?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
A triumph. When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
I hate the sight of blood. You guys don't take prisoners.
Would it make a difference?
Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
One guess.
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
With great tits. I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
The movie.
Oh, she's really enjoying it. I think. Is Mac okay?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo? It was out to Jude Law. Jude passed.
I have a small window of time.
Leo. Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty nine.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'll be fine. Really babe. Give me a minute.
This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair.
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
Oh.
To dander. Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
Really?
So where is young Jonah?
So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him.
Dander. He's allergic. Otis.
Oh. Do you have any pictures?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Anymore.
No, not anymore. Happy anniversary, scout.
What a nose. You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
Please?
I'm not so sure. Look again in three months.
Just did. Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.
You really need to be fucked.
Escape hatch. And Dad was having a go about the garden. Something was misplanted...
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Fuck you.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
Oh. You're them.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Well it's fucking time.
Forget it, Judy.
You're crazy baby. I love you.
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you? Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
A perfect night.
Damn near. And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm. We should do it again.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Hey! Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned. Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey. Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
Fantastic. Out here.
I love you, you're a genius.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Whatever you say. Listen, I love you.
He's directing now.
They're paying him scale.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
The Roses? And of course they said yes.
That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Yes.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
Before I forget. Put it on the bookshelf.
Just do what I say, alright?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Beats a lawsuit.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
Ryan's novel?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Happy anniversary.
Hardly...
Accept a compliment.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
Through the sweats or not?
Not.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No. I missed that.
I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
For good.
Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come...
What?
You want me to uninvite her?
No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Really?
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Okay. Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
It's taken care of.
It's alright. Be our guests.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
You've got Cal. You've got Gina. You've got Skye? We're the leftovers.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner. Don't be angry.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Listen to yourself... Don't worry, it's alright. We'll find him. What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away.
He'll find his way back.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Or shitty!! Otis!!
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
You walked out on a five year marriage.
Just stop right there, Sally. We've been through this.
Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her?
About me!
Hello? Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity. Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster. Exactly.
You're not ready.
I'll never forgive you.
I know.
I have no idea who you are.
I don't want to go tonight.
You don't have to.
Okay.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I guess.
That's under lock and key.
Me too.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
I know. It's for the baby's crib.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
Will you make love with me?
Sure.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Sure.
I'll do it.
Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne?
Lovely.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh. Well. Good.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Still. Well. Let's drop it.
Yes.
It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I did.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.
And I you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah.
He's the best dog in the world. They're both coming tonight. Not my idea.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Ah there's our snookums now.
What? Oh yeah, the camera man? They gave me a list.
God, I really need to jump about a bit. How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Oh. You're serious.
Right away. Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh.
A little out of my element.
No you're not.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Very well put.
But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
And Ryan works at home.
Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.
I'll be your best friend.
We're way past inappropriate.
I will treasure this.
Sally!!!!
I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.
Let's go for a walk.
You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.
Okay.
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold.
Come here.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake. This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
This is an amazing present. What a sweetheart you are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
Time!
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Well...wow...
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
He always has two or three going...
Yes.
I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Let's just go home, okay?
Sally?
Yes. And you've met Joe.
Oh?
Are you working on a new book?
Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.
Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I...
How long ago was it?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Really??
Oh yes, indeed. That was my clue, you see.
Andre Zhdanov? How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Do Peter Sellers again.
Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Yeah.
Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Very.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five.
It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill myself.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal. It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Oh great.
Really? I need a drink. Come hide with me.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
How?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Fuck you, Panes.
You see, that's worse.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Like the last time.
No. No, not like the last time. She was the rest of my life.
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
You know it's true.
I'm Levi Panes. Will you excuse us, Skye? It's time for Sally's meds.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Shit. It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars. With my discount.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No. Really. For real. Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Yes. Fine.
That's it? Yes. Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.
Alright. Well, that's something new.
No. Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I guess.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Rose.
Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
Absolutely. You always wonder where your books end up. Why don't we use it?
I'll be right out.
What are they?
I don't mind...
Relax. You've done enough.
Evie has a little something for you.
And here they are!
Ah.
Like Joe.
Hmm. Where are my kids?
In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.
I hope they're watercolors!
Nevermind.
Would you like to meet my husband?
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she? She's a genius.
Big time.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.
Oh Soph...
Well good. Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Oh honey, let's.
I don't have a drug problem.
Neither does Joe.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Z? <u>Our</u> Z? The little guy made it!
Invisible!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Right...because every ant's important!
Very well. Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well... I declared war!
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Wanna dance?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Really?
Why should everyone dance the same way? It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You -- you think I'm right?
Wait! When can I see you again?
Let me think. Hmmnn... Never. Bye!
I'm Princess Bala.
Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Quiet -- sshhh!!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>! You were pretty hot to trot then!
SSHH!!! SSHH!!!
How should <u>I know</u>?
I order you to find out where we are!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I've got a <u>name</u>. It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name! That's just a letter!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Come on -- it's gone! What are the chances of that happening again?
Wait, I hear something!
Hlllllllp!
Stop fooling around in there.
Look. How many other Princesses are there?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You were right...you were right! Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Let's dig in!
Yes?
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
You held onto this all that time?
There's something going on, Z --
There isn't anyplace else -- Except the worker bar.
The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Of course not --
You did?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Mom!
I just joined up. But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Attack? But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all. We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Barbatus?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Princess! You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Outstanding. Princess...?
Duty calls!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to. Have him brought to me.
Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Get me Ant Team Six.
Ant Team Six...
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, no, sir!
Good. You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Okay, son.
Not that one. Or that one.
No, sir!
Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
ONE TO NOTHING!
Engaged? As in you're getting married?
Affirmative.
So...you two are in love?
...Not enough food?
Oh, of course --
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Yes, what else?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
They should be... But there's something funny about that soldier.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby! You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Alright, let's move out!
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
...Ants...
Right! Ants! Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
I'll be back.
Of course. You were born two seconds after me.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet! They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
My mother.
That's sweet. That's real sweet.
Yeah. How much?
Under the mat?
That's right. Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
I seem to have dropped my key. Oh -- here it is.
Ma'am?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Care to make a small wager?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It's a bet.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
I sort of like it.
Yeah. I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Why?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Would you like to?
Sure.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Eight-thirty.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You're so right.
Three.
I thought so.
Nothing. There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Miss Kubelik -- -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Let me help you.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
You don't want me here --
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
Miss.
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
They had to pump it out.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Sure.
I am. Let me get the cards.
You don't have to entertain me.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean. Queen.
I don't want it.
Pick a card.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.
Gin.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Would you mind opening the window?
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure. What's that funny smell?
Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Oh.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Over a girl?
Here.
In the knee?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake. And you want to see my knee?
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You ought to see my backhand. And wait till I serve the meatballs.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
The dishes?
I mean, after that?
What?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I don't?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Fine. How's your eye?
Fine.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.
In there.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Seven -- -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Gas?
Yes, sir.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't know.
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
Sir?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh.
Are you going to deny it?
Yes, sir.
How would you like to go tonight?
Swap them? For what?
Now put down the key -- -- and put down the address.
Relax, Baxter.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
You too, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.
So it was. She threw it at me.
Sir?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Sir?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Mine?
Oh?
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
So what's it going to be?
Thank you, sir.
No I didn't.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes?
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
What does he mean, accident?
You?
Who else?
Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
Yes, sir. They are indeed.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
What do I -- ? Just a minute.
Now will you get out?
No!
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch. I didn't recognize your voice --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You threatening me?
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Hi, Doc. Had a late call?
Sometimes, there's a twi-night double-header. A nebbish like you!
Yeah. Well -- see you, Doc.
Slow down, kid.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sure.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What's her address? Where does she live?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Happy New Year.
What about him?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Who is Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Family?
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
No.
You got a girl-friend?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
My shoes.
Kubelik.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Yes, I know.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Let me take that.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
That's right.
You know I liked it better long.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I want you back, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Okay. I'm sorry.
What do you think?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
Fran --
I love you -- remember?
I promise.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Merry Christmas.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this. I love you, Fran.
All set for what?
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
He wouldn't.
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
What's the difference? Some schnook that works in the office.
Sssssh.
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will. You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Lovely. You were a big help.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It won't happen again.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Oh -- oh!
Yeah --
Where are you headed?
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I like all of them --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
I said I like all of them.
My men --
What !
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
What is this?
Sure, thanks.
Part.
Which part is that ?
My part. Beer, with ice and water.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Delta ?
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Tracks ?
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
Sometimes.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That we're dumber than we look.
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
God knows.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Sure. Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Let's go.
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
I'll go with him --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
No shit -- hot damn --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Who knows what's up there?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
We're Americans.
When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I never heard about that.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Would he remember you ?
Maybe.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Ours.
Touchy.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What is it?
Charlie?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
Charlie?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Yeah.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
A lame ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
Maybe.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
Do you know that jungle?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Boss left.
What do you mean?
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
You want'a surf, soldier?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
I got bored in Saigon.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
Hairy ?
What about this point here?
Who?
The enemy. Who else?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
The trees, eh...
It'll get here, soldier.
Yes, I know.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
I'm Kurtz.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You were not coming here, to see me?
No -- no, sir.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
No. My thinking is clear. But my soul has gone mad.
Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
I can handle it.
No water.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
Going back - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I was on threshold of great things.
Yes...
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
And you admired him?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Both of us...
Men looked up to him... He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
What?
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us. We're on his side.
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
Which one's the Colonel's?
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
When?
Any time -- us -- Americans.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
You think?
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
Bring your rifles, that's all. Take us to him.
That's me.
Why?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
So Kurtz is alive.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
And shut up.
His name is...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
No. Not really.
Kurtz. I know you've heard of him.
Yes.
What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
What things?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
I know.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
I do.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Anyone got a card?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Well , who's in command here?
Son of a bitch, sir.
Beverly Hills --
What?
Needs patching.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Wait 'til I'm across!
107 CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
139 CONTINUED:
175 CONTINUED:
43 CONTINUED:
I'll get you there all right.
94 CONTINUED:
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
I just want this over with.
157 CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
28 CONTINUED:
Back against the bars. Now.
Six months.
Can't be. Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
She's dead.
Oh.
I don't want to talk any more.
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Be right back. I left my camcorder in the car.
He still might be around. I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Not me. I'm equipped.
Come here...
Wait a second.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Where's Corbett?
I'm staying.
Nothing broken. C'mon, we have to hurry.
Let's keep going. We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Relax. I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
I know. Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Leave my traps. We'll tag up, couple days.
Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Ecology. Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- To take you to jail? It'll be my pleasure.
A daughter in Oregon.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
That's right. You're not.
Look, take these cuffs off. We need to work together.
I don't plan on dying.
Snow shelter. Okay. You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm right behind you.
Let's camp. There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Pushing it is flat wrong. All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Forget it. It would take days.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
Too bad we're heading west.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks. I'll be okay.
How many do you see?
What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
Too bad. We'd be out of here in a few hours.
An appetite. Maybe you won't die after all.
Hate to disappoint you.
Cowardly bastard. I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.
Shut up!
You kill me, you sign your death warrant. And hers.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Just passing through.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Don't try me. I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Nothing personal.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- Here?! Where's Wilder?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What are you talking about?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
This isn't your concern. It's over, here and now.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Damn. Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
We'll go with you.
Any idea who could've done it?
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Goddamn! Viking Bob! Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a long shot.
It's a three-hour flight. They shoulda got there yesterday.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Cool out. I ain't about to get blasted.
What you gonna do with it? Large bore's for shit on small game.
Not in the right hands it ain't.
Quit fucking around. Get in.
Ease off. We do this my way.
Doesn't matter. We know where they're going. C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
They'll have to come right past us.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
So shoot him. Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
You met the gift.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I want us to go out.
I love you.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't. So why are you h...
Stay out of this... Doctor?
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ... Dr. Bettes.
Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Since forever.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
His home number.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
Spencer.
Okay.
Spence.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Oh, please...
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
What are you doing here?
How do you know about my mother?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
What needs clearing up?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Yes.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What you did changed my life.
Thank you.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Is there another way to see it?
No.
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Welcome.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
Can we order first?
Fries.
One baked -- one fries.
Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting.
Here's the trouble with never.
It's one idea...
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Grouchy?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...
Because...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
You know what? I...
Yes. I really would.
Well...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
What a nice compliment.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
How to die, mostly.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What the heck do you mean?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
So am I, Frank.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Thanks for looking after him.
He's a pain in the ass.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Okay by me.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
What?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Wait here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
See, he's right. I need the cards. Simon, you're broke.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
What's he look like?
How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.
Okay, then.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Thank you for walking him.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Get out.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Stupid dog. I don't get it.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Never a break. Never.
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
I give you that one... Nice packing.
Does it matter?
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
I'm coming.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here."
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
I forgot to lock the door.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Please!! NO!!!
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there... I just want to tell you...
No. No problem. The airport, right?
Right.
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
No. No I'm not.
What is this?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
I know just what you mean. I'm pretty beat myself.
I'd love to sit in that jury. Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
What?
That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You're right. Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What? You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.
You can't --
No fucking way.
Okay, don't.
Holy shit! Robert Rath wants to know my name.
How long have you been freelance?
Two years. Two long fucking years.
Sounds like chickenshit --
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
We go around once.
Bullshit.
What? What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
What does that fucking mean?
All right, Bain. Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
That's right.
Shit. That sure is a lot of money.
What?
You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.
You would be.
Bain!
You're too late.
No. No. No. I don't believe it.
I don't give a fuck what you are. I asked you --
Do you want Rath or not?
Yes, sir.
Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol.
Sick. The flu.
I don't believe you.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
A new player. He's using the name Nicholai.
Know what?
The fucking contract! How in the fuck did he know.
I know. It was a joke.
Tomorrow. The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Freelancer. A woman. Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
Paid in full.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
Robert? Robert?
$1,000,000.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
Um, five.
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
What? How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?
I work for the government.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Ten million --
Now you understand why I'm here.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
Yellow Pages. V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
'Them'?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
The nature of the business. You remove your competition.
And you want to use me to get him?
Yes.
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
Right.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Why?
Rath. Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No. Just Electra.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
Why?
Because I'm done.
It's not the same, is it?
Better than playing with yourself.
He was killed.
Why?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that. I never thought so.
Why not?
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course. I was going to be James Bond.
Ahhhh...
Women? No... not really.
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why?
Because you are a women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Then you went freelance?
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Because I want to know.
No. Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
No. Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
I don't.
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Mexico.
Thinking.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
What?
I wasn't expecting this. I need to think.
Why not?
It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think.
Oh. What do you think about?
Work. The things I need to get done.
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
No.
Not even a stalemate?
No.
What happens if you do?
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
Yes.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Really?
Sorry.
How was the beach?
The beach? It was nice.
Taiwan.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
Fine.
Then, we wait.
Aiiee. More waiting? I don't know if I like this plan.
That's right.
Five million apiece. You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I told you, he will.
You can't know for sure, how can you? I mean, you're not him.
I was.
Yes.
You killed him here? In this city, outside that bank?
Yes.
What happened?
He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game.
Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No. I went back to the hotel. And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes. Here I am again.
No.
I think I got one today.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops. They're useless. I like knights.
They're worth less points.
So?
I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.
Jesus, if someone had --
Nobody ever sees me.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
No?
It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.
I know. It makes me crazy.
Why?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
Why? I don't know.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Both.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you. A pro.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Did you --
No. I tried to stop it. I couldn't.
Was she the only one?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
Martin.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Yes.
Oh, God. I see it!
God damnit, Electra. This is not a game. This is business.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
A pleasure doing business with you.
Yes. Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one. Whatever you're having.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
Everyone regrets something.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Sometimes.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
All the time.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you believe that?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Yes.
Anytime.
Just a little ways. Up to those trees.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I hope not.
One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Average.
Shit... oh well.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Go ahead.
What do other guys do?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Some.
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Like you?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
And not even then sometimes.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Never heard of K-MART?
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
An alternative literary venue!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Squatted it.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
It's big, right Jahn?
We could make a run for it?
You got my word on it.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Well, don't get carried away.
'cause you stink of booze.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Yeah, I'll take some.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.
Close!
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
They'll never get us.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
Both, see you later.
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
What?
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Holly!
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It just happened.
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
What?
You capitalist pig!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
He's lying! I am.
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Huh?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
What happened?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
You're kidding.
Now you're using that word.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Lucky break!
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Yeah, somewhere?
Siberia.
What do you want me to do?
Good, what's his number?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Some deal you did there!
I should have read the fine print. I love you Holly, thanks.
Here!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What are you talking about?
No!
You're sure?
Sure I'm sure!
Do you know the way?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Doug?
Turn around quick!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Yes.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
That's my mum's.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Here's the details.
We should be done by the weekend.
Really?
I could pencil you in if you like?
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
How about you Brutus?
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Whatever!
You're everything a guy could want.
What? You are crazy!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Don't worry it's okay!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Fernet and tonic.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Thanks.
I hope so!
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
Not this time, Kat.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yep, it's all yours.
Okay.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
About forty minutes.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Good, great....Dobchay!
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
What for?
Insurance!
What is bail?
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
How do I know what's being said?
Am I invited?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
We don't need you.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
Thanks.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Guests.
Sometimes.
Sure!
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
How did he look?
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
It's Josh's.
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
No!
Really!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
You may use my office.
Yeah!
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No problem, is it at your place?
Yeah.
Come on, that shit can wait.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Just yesterday.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Maybe it is!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Well come on, sit down.
Later.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Why?
It's time to go home, Holly.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
You bastard!
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
We're not sure...
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Some Americans?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
And I have no idea why.
I do.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
About a job.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Thanks.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Me neither.
No. I won't be long.
Late night. You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
You sleeping with her?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I meant he's a doctor.
That'd be something.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I didn't know either.
Landon --
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
I need to whizz.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I'm just wondering --
You do --
And you don't. What's she doing in there?
York Ave.
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
It was.
Scamming's a strong word.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.
Me.
What kind of a man are you, son?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
-- Obviously.
Were?
You don't know me.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
This play -- ?
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
My act?!
Then we both know. I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
Because that's where the fire is?
Like me.
No. Not like you.
So you agree you need help?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I'm an enemy?
Kinda. Yeah.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Maybe a little of both.
Go for it.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
It's private.
You want to tell me...
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Ambitious.
And you have to meet my father.
Don't bother!
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You think so.
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you think I'm strange?
The world of the dead?
Could be...
That is my telescope.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for something -- someone.
I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
In 76 years, me neither.
In ten words or less?
Yeah.
My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Don't you?
No.
You don't believe in anything?
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
You don't miss a thing.
Yes. And?
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Healthy as can be.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
That sounds like horseshit.
It's not.
Prove it.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No. But are you -- impressed?
What?
You.
Why not?
I'm not allowed to date.
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
No.
I know you want to.
We're doing something -- ?
Fun.
Where?
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
You're sometimes not sure?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Not possible.
Loved?
That. And less strange.
Twice a year.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Where?
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
I was twelve.
Where's the one you're building?
Mars.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
You planned this --
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
What about your father?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Me.
Sure.
I don't care.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
No.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Where? Why?
I'm sick.
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
All the time. I feel like I have no one.
I will.
Anything you want.
Nothing.
I used to like yogurt.
That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --
I don't want to come here anymore.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Lower. Same page.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
Better. I was really angry.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
It's not that simple. It costs money to do this at home.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
Yes.
He wants help with his lines --
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Up to?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
No.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I have expectations, too.
Dad --
It's time to tell him. It would be the right thing.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
By making me ill, he is punishing me! I just don't know what for.
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Yes, sir.
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
No.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
You decide.
Your parents are divorced?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Materially or spiritually?
Either. Both.
Praying.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I need to be with her.
In there.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
For the focuser?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Yes. You?
Getting by.
Yes.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
She did. It was you.
That's right. You just act like one.
That's right. The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Please.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
When do I get time for me?
You don't. That's the point.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Are you?
A similar triangle?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Scalene?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
Yes, sir!
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Seventeen.
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
Uh, hi....
How could I forget? Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Yeah. Maybe so.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
Listen, Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You do?
Coming, Eileen...
How are you?
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
What drill?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Not now....
Okay, then!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
Huh?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Lemme see that.
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
Why?
Why what?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Marty. Marty Lewis.
What?
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here...
Yeah, Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
Shhhhhhhh!
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right...
...To be traveled through
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Then where the hell is he?
Precisely!
Is Shemp all right?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
So what? We'd be rich!
You know me?
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
Oh, yeah.
A mall?
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
The power converter...
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Curious... Very curious....
You did what?!?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Perfect...
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Curious... Very curious.
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
What do you call this?
A car.
The Orpheum.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
What?
A Tab.
Sure,.
Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place!
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
No way!
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to your hair?
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
What's going on?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
Yeah.
You expect me to believe that?
What do you mean?
Not bad.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
He never bit me.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Thirty aught six.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Nope.
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
Sure.
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
I mean it.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Yeah.
What're you doing?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
I don't know.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
No.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
Can I be honest?
Sure.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Nothing.
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Something mi trabajo.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah?
Okay.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
It's your play.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
No.
I don't care.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Yeah.
Is that all there is to it?
Yeah.
Don't ask me.
What?
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Why?
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
Put that down. It's dirty.
How's he doing?
I got him in the stomach.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
I don't know.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.
Positive?
Yes.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
What?
Yeah.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Really?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Sure.
Yes?
This your place?
Yes.
No.
Just thinking.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Yes.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Maybe.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
Hold it right there.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
No.
Who're you?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees. Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks.
What?
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Vanished. Thin air.
First thing I did.
The deuce you say. That crate!
Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
So I was right. That's nice to know...
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Not really. This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out? She's a killer.
What is it, Tommy?
Where's the professor?
Whorfin? Does he know we're coming?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai. I failed flight school.
The door's locked.
At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Now!
What? How do you know that?
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Everybody okay up here?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You. Like the papers all say.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
The girl I remind you of.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
It's kinda hard this way.
The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Which? The one in my throat.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Any time.
Oh, my.
Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where? Where're you going?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Absolutely.
That's just what you would say. This is so unreal. I'm dreaming...
Sure. I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?! Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?
A what?
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
You look! It's not here!
Damn John Whorfin--!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before? Can I ask?
Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
Better than him.
Why me?
I didn't drop 'em.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Pictures don't lie.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
No! Ditto the professor-
Asshole probably got lost.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet I do.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
Please, Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
No, no 
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
What. What don't I understand?
Hello.
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
You wrote Bill's scripts! Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful...
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Who?
Chet! From downstairs!
Garland, it's me.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
What DID you mean?
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
A week, eight, nine days 
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
I...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
It's still a little early for me.
So be it.
Are you all right?
I need help, Audrey.
...Huh? No, I'm 
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
I'm a writer. Ted O 
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Who?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?! You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well not much.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
A souse!
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Go ahead, son.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
What do you mean, Barton?
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
...That's fine.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little 
Well, you just... sound a little
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Pictures! Jesus!
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
Charlie. How are you.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Yeah...
Ready... wrestle!
Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
A little lift, yeah...
You're leaving?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
What a dump...
Well...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
Hold on 
You gotta believe me 
Hold on 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
We gotta call the police 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
What do you think happened?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I'm at the Earle.
Lou.
...Both maybe?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard! That's what I hear, anyway...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
And then... well...
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Mr. Lipnik.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Must be.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Excuse me?
Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Huh?
What 
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Nine days  Tuesday 
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Would that be good enough for ya?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Anyway.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
Only fry you once.
You two have some sick sex thing?
...Fred...
How's about it, Bart?
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
No.
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
A couple days ago.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Did you find out about her parents?
Bring 1976 up.
It's bullshit. You know it is.
Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
No.
No?
Thank you.
Yeah.
You don't look so okay.
Baby-sitting. Rookie cop.
What else is new?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
She said what you said she'd say.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you quit.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Nilsen.
Yes. I care about you. I did it for you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something. From a clinical point of view.
What was she like in school?
I hardly knew her. She gave me the creeps, though. I don't know why.
Yes you did. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil. She's brilliant. Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here. Where is he?
What?
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
Did you go home with him?
No. I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
If that's the way you want to play it.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It won't last.
A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I have nothing to hide.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are fun.
I loved him. I hurt.
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Because you didn't love him --
That's right.
Thanks.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
You see? We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No. Come in.
No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I don't know. But you do.
Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Yes, you did. They never tested you, did they? But Internal Affairs knew.
I like you.
Do you?
Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Fine.
Ice?
Please.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
It's not the same thing, is it?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.
No. I wrote it years afterwards.
Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
She's seen everything before.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine. How's your back?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets? I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
I know.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Make love to me.
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I never have before.
No?
No more games, Nick. I'm tired of playing games!
Try me.
When?
About three months before I met you.
Why?
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Funny.
Honey, why don't you go in the car? I'll be right there.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you? What's she doing?
No.
Liar.
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?
No.
Come over here and tell me no.
I'm very good at research. I'll help you.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really. What are you writing about.
A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.
What happens to them?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
I told you. She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.
We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after.
What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
No.
He was murdered.
Really. Maybe that's why you're from Homicide. How?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
How's that?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Sometimes.
Cocaine.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
.38 revolver. Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Nilsen?
That's him.
Nope. There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.
Thanks.
I hope I helped you out.
You did.
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it.
She misses me.
Hallelujah.
No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.
Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
Somethin', though.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I wasn't there last night, either.
You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should.
Say what?
I feel fine!
Why the hell not?
I don't know. I'm just not.
She's right. You got an icepick in you yet?
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
If she's telling you the truth.
He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.
I'm going with you.
She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Yeah. I know.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water. See where she leads.
What do you want?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Is he dead?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
We bring her in for questioning.
And you volunteered.
I'm sure.
What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.
She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.
How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, too Nick.
No.
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Are you vice?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy. I'm her -- friend.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.
He was shot.
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I don't know.
When's your show?
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
See ya in an hour. So what do you think?
Of what?
The whole thing  painting.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Yeah, I met her already.
That's good. At least they're interested.
What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
I don't like beer.
We can do better. It needed more white.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
No.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You haven't been by lately.
You name it, I paint there.
How about right now?
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
How do you know?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I need a dealer.
I'm here.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
You mean like an ape?
Yes, but as a black painter 
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
What?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Yeah.
Very well.
Out?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Still not here.
 In this corner?
Yeah..
Use your fucking instinct.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
What's wrong with you today?
Willie Mays.
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
About what?
Your people.
Oh  you mean black people!
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Good. What do you have?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Drugs??!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
What who's saying?
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
Well thanks!
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
What's that?
A present I picked up for you.
Pretty much the same.
Forget it.
George?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
That's great.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Some of them.
Stand still.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
I don't eat junk food.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
My point exactly.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
5:11.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I can't. After the show.
Forget it.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Uh-oh!
No, nothing, ah ... His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Vichyssoise. Supposed to be cold, right?
No, actually I feel worse.
Alright, thanks.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I think I'll take the stairs.
You'll never guess.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Right. Sure. And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's." You --
I'm -- sorry, I --
Good joke. Wanna hear another one?
We do.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply to people like him! Or us --
Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
You're not the Mayor.
What're you really after?
Have we?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
I'm tempted.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Oh. "Kyle."
Scare me? No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Yeah? Me too...
"We"? You and...
... and me. No, that's be me and me. Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
Had one. Didn't work.
And the truth frightened her?
Photojournalist.
Sure.
Nor I, on the second.
What're you doing three dates from now?
No hard feelings?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here. So why'd you come tonight?
You first.
I don't know. Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
No. No glass on the inside.
Weird, huh?
Yawn.
My blood? I ... I gave at the office.
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Was.
Down, Oswald. We have to talk. You see we've got something in common.
Huh? You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Oh, him again. He's already history -- check it out.
You're quick. Mayor Cobblepot.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed! You sent out all the signals!
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Dad! Save yourself!
Yes. <u>Yes</u>. Boyfriend trouble ..?
PMS.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
My lips are sealed.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Oswald: We need one more thing.
I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Eventually she married a young physician.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
As I've missed you. Sleep well, child.
Too late for what, dear child?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
The boys need help.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary. That's the first time in thirty years.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Thanks.
Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way or the highway?
No, my boy. I'm afraid none of us can.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Yes?
Right here, sir.
What seems to be the problem?
Women.
That, sir, does not compute.
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...
Passion. Of course. Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Oxbridge Academy?
Their new computer sciences division. How did you know?
I recognized the accent.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did.
You are going back to school.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady. It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
Divide and conquer.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Why?
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
What exactly are you doing?
I don't know. It just feels right.
Damn? Damn is not good.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I hate being lectured.
Freeze, you're mad. This capsule will slaughter thousands.
I didn't kill your wife.
Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear. Chicks love the gear.
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit. The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course. He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
No, Robin. He's going to jail.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
I'll borrow it from you. Four million - -
I can make it.
I can't believe we were fighting over a bad guy.
Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
I'm totally over her. Positively.
Me too. Great stems, though.
Umm-hmmmm.
Definitely.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
No. Her case is too advanced. But maybe, someday, with more research-
Just the beast.
What are you talking about?
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later. We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
I see you knew him.
That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Umm. What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But soon...
Can I get some help over here?
What? I'm sorry. You were saying...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
What?
You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
I wish I knew.
Well...um...her.
Somehow he survived. But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Presumed dead. No one knows.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
You left your back wide open. Freeze could have killed you.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
But he's never said a word-
I'm late for the dedication. Then I go after Freeze and Ivy. Alone.
Like hell you do.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce? I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her. To keep her for yourself.
Let's cool it for now. There's someone I want you to meet.
I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Where is my wife?
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.
You lie!
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm hungry. I think I'll have poultry.
Not good.
I find that unlikely.
You're skating on thin ice. My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme. These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Hop away little bunny. Before I cool your jets. Permanently.
At you? Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
One kiss, my love. For luck.
What do you mean?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.
Then you never loved me?
Sorry to disappoint you. But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason. I think I've had a change of heart.
I think they're getting worse.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
She has an excellent mind.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Apology hastily retracted.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
There's one other thing. I feel..
What?
...Afraid.
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
How ya doin', Al?
Al?
Big house. How many rooms?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Just checking, young sir.
Four seconds from...
What's wrong?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Exactly!
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
We'll talk some other -
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
Banzai.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Just ones this beautiful.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Exactly.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
Not much.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
And into a black dress.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
What?
I said I'm sure he did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I'm not-
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I don't want to remember!
Stop fighting.
You do know. Try.
...Not the bat?
What?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Excuse me.
Absolutely not.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Yesssssss. I know!
Can't tell if you don't say please.
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
...The Box can change their lives. Our stock coupons will spike.
Fred?
What the hell is going on here?
I don't think so.
...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
I got family. ...Please.
What say we flip for it?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Never heard of a double-cross?
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Here. Get a good seat.
About what?
Everything.
You're a genius.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Miss.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
The small one.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
Shouldn't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Too many people. Come on! SHIELDS!!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
I won't let you have it.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I loathe bats.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
I had to save you, Vicki. I -- -- Please trust me.
Great. Give me a grant.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Good. With any luck we'll run into each other.
Too much work. I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
No.
Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Odd desire for anyone.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
... We could try that.
... Looks like a convention.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I realize... the way things have gone between us... ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
I feel naked without it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry. We had another bat sighting.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Why, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future.
About how pretty you are, pretty boy. Maybe he'd like to know --
What are you, scared of heights?
I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
No shit. It was all over the pavement.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit. Now shut up. There ain't no bat.
Do you want this money or don't you? Now shut up! Shut up --
Because I want someone I can trust.
Oh, Jack. -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been --
Is that what you "heard"?
JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
And what happens if we say no?
That's it.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
What? I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said? Do you want to sniff my flower?
Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting.
All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Holy shit...
Likes to kill? KNOX Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through women.
His face. Allie, look at his face.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
... Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make. I'm the Batman.
Not what?
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
Yeah. Deja vu.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
I said I'd check with you.
Yes. Yes. Sometime.
Tom Jones?
Did you really ask?
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
One.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay. There's no one out here. Just open the door. Trust me.
I know you are. Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Hi..... Roses.
Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Great. You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?
Meaning?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Yes. Great. Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
About Charles...
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, I'm fine.
Annie, it's me.
Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.
No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Right first time.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Thanks, Annie.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Yes. Ahm... think I'11 ...

What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Isn't it?
Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
David?
Right. Got it.
I beg your pardon?
No. Perfect. Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
You're not going to ....
Er ... pray tell me why?
Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
Certainly is.
I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
Mmmmm...
A car sounds sensible.
Welsh.
Sean Connery.
There's a man. I woke up next to a man ...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure. You're right.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin. Jen?
Sure did.
They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
I vote for Bart.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
But is she gonna be okay?
How the hell should I know?
Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn. I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Okay.....
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Not at all, Governor. Very striking.
Why thank you sir.

Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
Nope.

Deep and hard.

D.C., Chief.
Agent Hurley...
Not now Bork.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.

Helen got it for me in Oslo.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane. Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam!
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Oh... I'm sorry...
How's your arm?
I'm not sure. It feels... frozen.
I am sitting.
I'll tell you what, Barbara. I don't think we survived that crash.
Two hours.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
... Hmmm?
De<u>ceased</u>. I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher. Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
What's she doing here?
I don't know. <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
They make gypsies look good.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life? What can we do?
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know. I'm sorry.
Not really... what's this?
Nothing. The bio buster? I don't get it...
She couldn't have. We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.
That's all we need.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Wait.
No. But it's somewhere without big worms.
Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
Look, she's right. We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident. C'mon.
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Of course I did.
Then it should be here.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him. Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Three times. Powerful number.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go? What d'ya mean? We need help.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
But he didn't. We've got him where we want him.
I didn't --
Little black party dresses?
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
Give or take a year.
We're ghosts.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>? It's this gross movie.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother. I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Really. I don't know.
I got it. And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
I got an A!
Uh-uh. Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Oh puh-leeze!
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. So what's my cut?
Can you scare them off?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Now, let's get rolling!
No. What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
You're the dead.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
What do you expect? You're dead.
Yes.
No. You don't want his help.
What do you mean? What's he do?
We're practicing.
I always tell the truth. Of course I can see you.
No, wait!
I want to be dead too.
No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
And live in what, our station wagon?
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped. Split. Vanished.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground. Who cares?
Are you a spirit too?
You do? Over here? On <u>my</u> side?
I think so.
That's right. They treat you like scum I bet?
Yeah.
Of course you do.
No, dummy. Two.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them. First word -- two syllables.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>? Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just <u>say</u> it.
You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
No I don't. I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
Then <u>I'll</u> help them. For a price.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
He's your cousin.
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Why not?
I think she's in with them.
Not these people! They are ruthless!
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom! One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
... sheets.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
They're ghosts. They do what they want.
Come on. Leave their stuff alone.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Otho, can you do it?
They're already dead. They can't feel a thing.
Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.
I saw some ghosts.
It wasn't a joke.
I thought I saw something.
Gooood!
Viridian?
Viridian? What is...?
Be brave! Otho take care! Onward!
Let's see. We could turn that into a media room.
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
<u>No</u>! Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here. They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
It's okay. How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
My sentiments exactly. Porcelain is for teeth!
Why not?
Their wedding clothes.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
But not for long...
Yes. I think so, too.
Oh, fine.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
No, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Thank you, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Oh, really?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
In a day or two, yes.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
... But he's...?
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I wish he were here...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, sir.
A Black man gave me the message.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I am.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Your family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
No. I like it here.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
That's good.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Yes.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Of course.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey.
No, thank you.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Hello, Dennis.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Thank you.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Hello, Sid.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Hello, Morton.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Really? Really!!!
I don't want Robert.
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
I agree.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Thank you.
... I see.
I agree.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
And I'm Ben.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Sir?
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
Yes. Of men and women.
... Oh.
No.
No. That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Good day, Sally.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
It's very sore.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Very good.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Yes. It seems to be.
... Yes sir - elevator!
... Good evening, Louise.
I see.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. It is.
Yes.
Yes.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
... The gardener? ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today...
I see...
You live here? ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Since you were a child?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
I was given meals, and a home...
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.
... Hello.
... Oh, really...
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Yes. I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
That's good... That's good.
Good evening, Wilson.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Hello, Sophie.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's not that, I just...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Look, Johanna...
I said good night!
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No, sir.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
Oh? What?
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Yes, I did.
... Well?
I'm afraid so.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
Mr. Gardiner...
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Okay.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah.
John Makel...
Malkovich!
The one where you're that jewel thief.
I never played a jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
The monkey.
Yeah. Okay.
May 11th.
I'm a puppeteer.
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
We have to make it an early night.
She's very beautiful.
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Right.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
What?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'm scared.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
We'll talk about it in the car.
I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Why?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
What?
You've always hated the animals.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What's that?
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
Yes.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
We?
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Suck my dick!
Shut up!
You bastard.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
What's that?
I'm a puppeteer.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I love you so much.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I know.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Let me try!
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
Yes?
Yex?
I said "yes."
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Yessir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
I wouldn't know.
No, really.
I'm right?
Who told you?
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.
The usual, Barry.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
My tits?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Please, let me explain.
No.
It better be.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
You're evil, Maxine.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hello. Wendy.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I like that.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Why are you being like this?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Count me in.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
You bastard!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Yes, Hi.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
I have to see you.
One hour.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
No.
Who needs dancing?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
What the fuck is going on?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
He's a selfish bastard.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
What want ye, girl child?
Then what do I do?
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Well what?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Aw, Baby.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
and she is mine...
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
THE WHITEFOLK?
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Don't pay to complain.
You on your way home?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Yes?
She gone like they say?
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Thank you.

In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?

Well, what can you do?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.

She likes to see you off in the morning.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.

Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Go upstairs I said!!

She likes this dress...
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.

What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
It's her, ain't it?
Her who?
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
You?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
For what?
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Never found out.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
What yard? When who-
It ain't what you think.

Make it the way I always do.
Yeah. Too sweet.

Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Uh?
What do you think?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
It's the LeBaron.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Uh-huh.
Who're you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?

Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.
Yes sir. It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yeah, but we're--
My rug.

Uh-huh.

And was there anything of value in the car?
Papers. Just papers. You know, my papers. Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Your rug was in the car.
Separate incidents?
Far from it.
Mm.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah. Thanks man.
Oh, hey man, how are ya? I wondered if I'd see you again.

Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Sure. Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides.
What's your drink, Dude?

Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thank you.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
He fixes the cable?
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Yeah, but what about--
Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man, and thorough.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver? You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Huh? Autobahn. A-u-t-o. Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well...yeah--
So Dieter has the money?
Huh? No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Delayed after-eff--
I want you to see him immediately.
Maude?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Oh?
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
Huh? He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
This was a valued, uh.
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?
State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
Hey Walter--
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
MARK IT ZERO!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man! He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
Calmer than you are.
Huh?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
Yeah.
What if it's during a game?
I told him if it was during league play--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll.
Have it your way. The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
The ringer! The ringer, Dude! Have they called yet?
My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Agh--
Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
It is a fucking game. You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
What the fuck is going on there?
Okay Dude. Have it your way.
What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?
We throw the money out of the moving car!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!
Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
What the fuck?
Walter, please--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Aw, fuck it.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates--
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
This whole fucking thing--I could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
Huh?
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Nihilists! Jesus.
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah.
All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Uh.
Yeah, go figure. Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . . Is this your homework, Larry?
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is the car out front yours?
Is this your homework, Larry?
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter! Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money. And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Huh?
I understand. That's why I picked up the phone.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Shit yeah!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Huh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude. RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
No Dude.
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
Hurry Dude. I'd go but I'm pumping blood. Might pass out.
The Dude, actually. Is what, uh.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Dude! Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
You're a fuck, Walter!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning. Tell Walter.
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?
...Us? DUDE
Yeah?
Okay, listen--
Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.
Yeah.
So no funny stuff. Okay?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Right, Dude.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
I understand sir. Could you slide your shorts down please?
Did I urinate on your rug?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Employed?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
I don't know, sir.
Bunny.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Well we--I don't--
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Well. . . yeah.
All right, get out. Both of you.
Walter!
Help me put him back in his chair.
I said out. Now.
You're bullies! Cowards, both of you!
Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Bullshit. Walter!
This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.
Am I wrong!?
Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.
A world of pain.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
All right! There it is! It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Someday.
Survival.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
No. They've been training to hunt you.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
I didn't know.
Minutes.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Fry 'em.
Save it. I don't want to hear your words. Let's do this NOW!!!
What?
I don't think so.
For what?
Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies.
I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
I don't understand.
Not good.
I want to see the sun rise.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I don't like it.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Thought you were dead.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Not alone.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here. Watching us.
Nomak?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You're wasting your time, Blade. The flechette's a dud.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane? He'll kill us both!
Maybe it's better that way.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
Two so far.
No. This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
It depends. We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Look, what's your problem?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope. Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much. What about you, though?
After last night? Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit. When did they get to you?
Are we bringing home strays now?
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet. You can help her.
Wait.
Don't even start, old man.
China Town. I need more serum. What's all this?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
How can you be out here?
Watch me.
Frost!!!
Take him.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You're blind --
There are other ways to see. Sit.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Show me.
Who is LaMagra?
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
I'm sorry, I --
You're joking --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
He didn't. Get over it.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Look closer.
The way they move, they way they smell --
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like what?
Like me.
Some kind of archive --
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
For your miracle cure?
Cancer.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Then what is it?
I don't know -- Look at this blood smear --
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Sometimes --
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Join the club.
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
--Anna--
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Bullshit! Talk!
Nick!!
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Christ.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
--a six week bun in the oven--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Think again.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
Who?
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Then there she blows.
The Witch's voice.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
So whoever built this--
Oh, sorry, right.
That's a joke?
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
I haven't killed any--
--Nick!!
It's like traveling back in time.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
What?
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
You sure?
<u>Yes</u>.
What is <u>this</u>?
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
You don't want it though.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
--fine, later, fine.
You said the name "James."
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
Yes.
--scared the living shit out of us.
I want to see the tapes.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
Get your goddamn--
--Cotter's--
Sleep.
--you should get back into bed.
I guess, yeah.
What?
Just now?
No.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
Here.
Then I'm going--
Whatever you want.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
--no, what's wrong with you?
Why?
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
I know, I know.
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
--no one'll ever know.
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
Looks like a rope.
You have to go.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
Sometimes.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
What? That made her lose the baby?
Something. Someone.
Turn the tapes back on.
Fine.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Fine.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Four in the morning?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--fuckin' A right--
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I do.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Shut-up.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Ask me what I don't have.
What?
No fucking.
No.
Try a long walk.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, nuts?
What're you doing with all this shit?
--coming out of the water--
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
What?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Fucking owl!
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I don't know.
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--Domini!
<u>What</u>--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
For "James?"
Goes right along with these two.
No one ever comes here.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
What?
The wheel.
--turn the camera off--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Graduate Thesis--
--about the Witch--
--a Wiccan--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
I am.
I'm not finished.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
Fine.
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
Look over there.
--now there.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<u>What</u>?
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
--I dunno, I just woke up--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
By day? No sweat.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--oh, Jesus--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Enough to keep sane.
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
I think it's time to get out of here.
I can't!
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
--shit!!!
One of the printers.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Ancient runes--
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Ah, Domini?
What?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Not planning on sleeping at all.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
No. I don't think so.
Why she kills children.
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Then I have no idea.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
He'll never know.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Okay.
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's why she kills children.
I know, I know--
Sure. I'm sorry.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Get some more beer.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
--fuck Anna!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Not this one.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
--thank you for calling--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No.
I am?
It won't?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
No, I--
Well I do...
Abby...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Sort of...
Meurice--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
Yeah.
What was that?
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
See a guy.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
What?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
I couldn't believe it either...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Abby--
You're bad.
I said you're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Ray--
I don't know what you're talking about.
...What was that?
Marty.
All right...
In the trunk.
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Thanks.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
About ten years.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Christ, I'm getting bored.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Ever durned one.
What?
What night is it?
...Friday?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Lubbock?
Uh-huh.
Yeah...
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...Hell.
No.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Fine. Suit yourself. ...Having a good time?
You owe me for two weeks.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
Most of the night...
No. It just made them feel better.
Got a job for you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
It's not strictly legal.
I didn't say that. Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
I want you to go fishing.
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Nobody knows you hired me?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
How would I know?
I don't know, didn't he call?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Right.
Right.
What.
This.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Where? ...I'm very careful about that.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Meurice...
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.

Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything.
What do you want?

Does that scare you?
Shut up.

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?

Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Maybe so.
Not really, why? You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

Oh, okay. can I call?
Okay. yeah, call.

Are you sure?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.

Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.

So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay, Sandy.

Okay. okay.
Goodnight.

Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
No.
Okay. great!
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
It's okay.
... You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Frank!!

Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Go ahead.

Go ahead!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Hey Jeff.

Are you feeling okay?
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Alright.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
That sounds great!
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec. Excuse me.
Okay.
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.
Oh, I see. George. Well, that explains everything. Open your mouth, George.
Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.
My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much about you.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
What is?
Yeah. I am.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
What is?
Yeah. I am.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check.
I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
What? You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
It's garbage.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
It's garbage.
Yes, I am.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Excuse me?
What? Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths? Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes.
The coca is my responsibility!
You're a fucking amateur!
Excuse me?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.
Diego needs to see you right away, please. Excuse us, Amorcito.
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's already been negotiated. It's done. The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me. No one else.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Yeah. I understand. Just business. Right. Fuck you.
Yeah. She told me.
I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were.
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
Fuck you, then. I sign nothing.
What's that?
Get me a six pack.
Your offense? Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Ah, yes. The murder.
Nothing. Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind. Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
What's the other one?
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.
Great. I love the Bahamas.
Allo?
Diego? It's George.
George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.
Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must. It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on...
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Touche.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
Just a friend.
Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Yeah. You do the talking.
It's two-point-five, George. I am sure.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
What?
No more brothers, Diego.
Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.
I did not.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
Coke.
Cocaine? How much?
I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long? A week?
Today.
The boy is happy, Fred. Don't be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off. You're tan.
Mexico.
Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.
Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?
I've seen those in magazines. They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Oh, I see.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Who's the cheapskate?
Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Un sapo?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
I want money.
Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
Money.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
I know.
I'm going to California.
I know.
I'm going to California.
You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
Tough spot.
Not mad.
Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.
Dad.
I heard. Ermine, your son is here.
Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You're not going to trial?
No.
Good.
Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.
Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
That was a good one, Dad. That was really something. Remember that?
I meant every word of it.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What about him?
He's going down, George. It's election year. We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you doing here?
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know. My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
What is your name?
I like fire.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Put that shit away, they're here.
Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out.
She did that before.
No. These are her first steps. Watch her.
Yeah. I know. She did that before.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
Can you lift the furnace. I need money.
Where are you going?
Out.
Don't give me that shit. You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
What?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will. Of course.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then.
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.
Kristina's fine.
Is she here? Is she coming?
George, he wasn't asking.
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Are we gonna split up?
How are you doing?
What?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
California.
I'll be here.
I don't know. Maybe California.
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
I swear. On my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad. I know...
Shhhh.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay? It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Who's the co-pilot?
They're over at the booth.
Yes, I am.
Very nice. I'll take it.
Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
No, man. I'm too fucked up.
G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Yeah?
What?
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.
That's right.
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
And you believe the NLF?
Exactly.
And here?
It depends on you.
Second name.
Sail.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I'll explain.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Not enough.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Sure ...
Here?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Go away.
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening, sir.
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Yes, a name for the operation.
Of course I am.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I'm trying.
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I don't know.
Thanks, Mister D.
That's the best part. She gets it all -- everything.
How?
Then you can go.
Cause?
Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
But there's more?
Yes.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Yes.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Increase his heart rate.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your witness.
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?
Sex.
Could you be more specific?
No -- never.
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
Sit down, Frank.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.
Why would she want that?
Aren't they all?
Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Your Honor -- please!
Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.
I didn't hear it.
Her. It's an obvious move. I'm building a case against her, remember?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You get his statement?
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No. I haven't done it in years.
No.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Thank you.
Six years.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Tell the court about that, please.
Yes.
How did he look?
Horrible. He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Yeah.
His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
No. She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Show me.
About a year and half ago.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
Yes.
Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say?
Doctor Steven Trammel. Cardiologist.
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
It didn't.
Why not?
She left me.
She didn't. She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Thank you. The State rests.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
Cocaine.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
No.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
I was angry.
I suggest it never happened.
No further questions.
That's enough.
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
No.
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes. I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Yes.
What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
No.
High school?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes.
Where did you meet him?
We dated for about a month last year.
Then what happened?
Yes -- he did.
How?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Do you remember his exact words?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes -- cocaine.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Yes. I suppose it's possible.
He video taped you.
That bastard!
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No! Why would I want to kill him?
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
No.
Because he called me.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
And she left shortly after that?
No further questions.
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
I thought the subject was sex?
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
Sure. Where to?
I know.
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi. It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- not at the office. I've got a better idea.
It's okay.
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
You take a lot for granted.
What?
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true. You have to believe me.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
No -- I'm a survivor.
That's crazy.
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She's waiting in the conference room.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you too, Dad.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
I gotta go. I'll call you later.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities." Who told you to say that?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a seat.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
How often do you use cocaine?
I can back it up.
You better. Please answer the question.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
I'm always open to learning new things.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
He could let you have your vacation.
Some example you set.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
I can think of worse ways to go--
Why don't you talk to him now?
Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Where have you been?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
Why did you lie to me?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
I'm not.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.
Talk to me.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
It was a place to start.
Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?
That's too bad.
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork?
Sorry.
Daddy -- stop it!
What time did you leave?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
It didn't get there from me.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
I simply can not stand that tone!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I know. I don't understand it either.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
No.
No. You can have them.
Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
He's not coming.
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
No, I don't think so. I --
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
No, what?
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Yeah.
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Hmm-mmm.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Yeah.
Oh! You caught me.
WHAT!
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
Francesca.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
Not at all.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And how long are you here for?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
I doubt that.
Why?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Okay.
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God... You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
Oh you!
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
You sound like an artist.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you miss it?
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
You get used to it.
When?
You want to go back in?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. Uh...
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
Yeah. See you later.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Sure.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Yes, that'd be nice.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
What were your parents like?
What?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Am I too heavy for you?
No.
Yes, thanks.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Sure.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?! It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm going to miss you.
It's only four days.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Okay.
Hmm?
Nah.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
You people really don't like dogs.
Some holes can't be filled. Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
I know damn well she's there.
It's the only way. It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Then what do you care?
Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.
Alright. Yes sir. Anything you say.
Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.
Died there? How?
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Take who where? What you smokin'?
Nothing. Contact paranoia. Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Just some flies.
Some flies? I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Damn. It's so...fresh.
Go for it.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw. I think it's... I dunno. Something about it just buzzes me.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Let's get going. Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Maurice left. Tia's taking a bath.
Damned if I know.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Fine. But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
That's some terrible shit.
Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Bones.
I do alright. Everybody's happy.
But things change. You gotta think ahead.
I said, no thanks.
Go on. It won't kill you.
What?
Where we'll always be...
But.
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird. I can remember when we was his age...
We met.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
How did you get in here?
And the hell everybody else, right?
Aw that's easy. I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Have you ever been inside?
Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse.
All the more reason I should be here.
Please. It's for your own good.
Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who? Who is he? What is he?
Your father. He was your father.
Who?
No we won't, Momma. I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Mother! No.
You moved into this block?
Naw. But they will be. They're the best.
How do you know?
I manage them.
Anytime. Be seeing you.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.
What else does she say?
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in. Who knows.
And you believe her?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
What? Oh yeah. Coming.
It's alright. If you want to go home...
My old man calls the shots. He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill! Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay. Listen:
Here!
I can't!
Back here. At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
A little business move I made. On my own. I think you're gonna approve.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done. You didn't want us there.
I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people.
That's the past. It's dead.
Dead? I don't think your past is dead. It's alive. And it bites.
Dad?
Daddy?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Don't call me that.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard.
That's a Bozo no-no. Jay-bird.
That's it. Get out. Now!
You cut him, or I shoot you. Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe?
No time for eightball. I got your tip.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Now you.
12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me.
Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Fuckin' comedian. See you tomorrow.
We got a gift for you, Eddie. Fresh new BMW.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
It was just like in my head.
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not? He eats everything else.
I'm not joking boy. Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
No thanks.
That building?
The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where.
How could that be? The box was packed!
Moe's terms.
Ours!
We're all tired. Everybody makes mistakes. Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Evidence of what?
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar. Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake.
Know what?
Open the case!
All right! Where's the key?
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
You're a dead man! A fucking dead man!
Where is it?
Yeah, I know.
Ask Johnnie! Ask your rat-fuck son!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Stay away!
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't. I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
All part of the business.
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What? Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
It was unbelievable! Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ... in the linen closet.
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
There's no time.
Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
No! They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him. I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
All right, Caesar.
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
No.
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
Shut up, Violet! This is between me and Johnnie.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops. Stall them as long as you can.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
I had to. You made me.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Good boy.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine. Just bruises and shit.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Oh, right.
Go right ahead, sir.
Good idea.
Where's the fucking money?
No. Rajeev's in India.
Five.
I should be going.
What? How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
Another time.
Sure.
Lick me.
Where is it?
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Why?
I could be lying.
Are you okay, Violet?
Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Sure, Mickey. Sure.
Hey, Mickey.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink. Sit down, Lou.
Me? Why?
Yeah.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Yeah, that's it.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Where in the hell is he?
Ssh! I can't hear Gino!
Oh yeah. Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
Gunfire? Is this a joke?
How do I know you are cops?
All right.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You did the right thing.
... thank you.
Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Pretty much. One day at a time.
Good guess.
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
Truck. Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really. I was referred to him.
Oh, really.
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink?
Sure.
No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer. Of course.
No.
Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Maybe.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
... yes.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
Don't apologize, please. I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
How did you meet him?
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.
He's a launderer?
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
Yes, it is.
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
So am I.
Nothing.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
Work.
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I think so, too.
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
How much money?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
I am, but ...
I think ...
Yeah.
Then what? Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
To let it dry.
In his office. I saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Good.
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Why?
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
... shit.
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
Fine.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Shit! Oh shit!
He won't.
Trust me, Violet.
If he does ...
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.
Why?
C! Shit, I'm sorry!
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I won't.
I think we're going to find out.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
We're almost there, Violet. just hang on.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Don't be sorry. Help me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
No.
... Me neither.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
Caesar, come here. Sit. We talk now. You too, Johnnie.
Jesus Christ, Pop. You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Hey, Johnnie ...
Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
Caesar? What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
I think everything is okay.
Violet?
Yes.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
No. Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
<u>No you're not</u>. You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think.
I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
...which one are you?...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
...it's a problem...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
Why?
Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about?
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Jason... They can't let you go...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
I don't know.
Get the kids out!
Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Right.
You have your passport?
I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
Yeah, I know...
Yes, sir... How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
One moment, please... I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
-- sir? --
One moment, sir.
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane?
Yes. Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
His brother. You know his brother?
Right. Yes. Of course.
It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
We thought you were gone for good.
Did you?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
Excuse me?
That'd be great.
Oh, Jesus...
Please. I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Get me out of here. <u>Please</u>.
I want to go home.
For twenty thousand dollars.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
<u>No</u>. No, that was too easy --
Wait up -- -- just wait up --
You swear? That's great. I feel so much better now.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
I thought about it. I don't know.
That's it? Is that it?
Looks familiar?
No. No. Go around. Keep going...
Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
I guess.
I don't remember any of this.
Jason...
Thanks for the ride.
Anytime.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
I guess so.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it -- -- do it -- what's he got in there?
...omigod, no...
-- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture?
Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong. I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
What is that?
I don't know.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
Yes. That's who I want to be.
xxxxxx
What?
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you.
This your store?
Yes.
Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Not really.
So get the hell out of here.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. It's always something, right?
What?
Get everyone down in the basement.
You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
Wait a minute --
I'm sorry.
xxxxxx
That's the only angle.
What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something.
Hang on...
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
I tried.
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>Where am I</u>?
I told you. You need to rest.
I don't know.
I won't forget this.
Uh - what? - I ...
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
I fixed it myself.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Tuttle! ... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
...aven't you?
...Yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
...sabotage!
... ere please.
... yer ducts.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
You must save the day.
It's reply paid.
Oh ... Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
Oh, right ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Layton.
Jill Layton ... You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Beginner's luck.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Well, I ...
Well ... well, I ...
Gillian Layton?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Jack!
Long time no see!
Sorry. Nothing. See you - I'm going to be late.
You are late.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
You remember Alison?
Remember how they used to stick out?
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Mr Helpmann!
SAM! What a surprise!
Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Yes, thanks.
What?
What is it?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
So what are you going to do about her?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
I do. Goodbye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Yes we have, Jack!
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Bastard!!!
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
What?
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Jack ...
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
Information Adjustments.
If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?
Ah.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Good!
Who are you?
No.
Please!
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
Oh, sorry.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I don't know. Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why?
I didn't like it.
Why not?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
Where are you taking me?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
Looking for you.
No, really.
Really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
We've got both.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
Stop it ... damn you!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
What?
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Oh ... Jesus!
No you're not!
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Are you sure?
Yes.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Take care.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
You've been promoted.
What a BITCH!
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
Next of kin!
27156789/074328/K.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
You are good to me Sam.
Don't mention it. See you later.
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
Yes.
What's the matter?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
Yes. NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!
I never signed the form.
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
What?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You want to take my console into your office?
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so. Monsieur?
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
What is it?
It's something for executives.
This isn't rare!
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
I want to talk to him.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Not now ... please
Mistake?
Um ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I know, I know ...!
I ... uh ...
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Thank you for calling Cen -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that?
What? Who is this?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?
No, sir.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval. the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
Numero, trois.
Central Services.
Fixed?
Fixed itself.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Not ... as such ...
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
Emergency procedures.
What is it?
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
Who fixed your ducts?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is this? Who the hell are you?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
What?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The pace?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
No. Wait here.
What do they want you or?
Time to go.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I'm sorry, Pierce. You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation. What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
It's a miracle.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
No underwear?
We are virgins.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates.
He flipped out.
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
Mary, we really have to go.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
No!
You're going to live.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Ten-four.
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
No way, man.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
IB Bangin.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
What did you say?
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
Yeah?
What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
John, play the Sinatra.
His heart's beating.
I know him. That's Noel.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
At least he's got people around him.
It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
Yes.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
No.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
You look so different.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I think it looks good.
Sleeping.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
No, no.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
He'll be all right.
There's no time.
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I think the worst is over.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
God help us, he's hungry too.
What's wrong.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
It's coming.
What look?
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Greatest job in the world.
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
No.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Look out!
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
I never felt better in my life.
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
How's he doing?
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Let me think.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
Do it!
Frank!
No shit.
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
What?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
You know what. The radio.
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
They'll just keep calling.
He's drunk.
Faster!
Relax, will you.
You really think so?
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
One more time!
No way!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Yeah.
You've made my dreams silly.
Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay.
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Fifty, right?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
Just don't physically... Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
It's not loaded.
I'll find some copy. Be right back.
No?
The pointers were great. I'll study the tape.
I'll put her on.
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Why? What did they do to you?
London. That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
Okay.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Why?
Yes.
That's your full name?
Yes.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Eventually rising to...
Office Bimbo. No, I'm sorry.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Stop the tape, okay. Forget it, Ellen. Let's call security and get him out.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Why do you say that?
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Sure.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Good night.
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.
We can cut back at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Not because you have to.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Watch? --
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Yes.
Good.
A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Yes.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Okay, great -- good luck.
You too.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
No!!!!!
This is important to me.
Yeah. Well...I think it is important for you too. Sit down.
Let me think a second. It's tough.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
No. You know that I'm not.
How?
Hi. Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Really?
I'm going to take it.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Your hair's a little funny.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
No -- Don't worry about it. Let's do this.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Stop it.
I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
I understand. I'll go with you.
Thanks.
So I quit.
No.
Move away from me.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Uh-uh. I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, that's nice... We'll need some new lines.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Yes.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
I'll speak to you soon
I'll be right down. It's right tight.
Yes, there is.
I'll never tell.
I liked it. He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
He said something about...
Let me hear it!
Should I...
Just a two-second dissolve.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Because...
Right there, Bobbie.
Bobbie, please.
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
You talked me into it.
Yes. That's right.
One's enough.
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
Okay.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
No. I'm doing fine...Look.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
It's Paul.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
Finish quickly. I don't want you getting obsessive about these things. Good night.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
It's not.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
It's not opinion.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Fill for a second.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
I was a lot earlier.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
How are you at back rubs?
Hey?
We're working here!! You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now --
You make me nervous. Anyway if I can pick your brain --
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit. Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.
Excited.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
Yeah?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Okay.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'll be the judge of that.
I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No. Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
We can go together.
Who?
Me!
Uh-uh.
Great.
Well...
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
No. I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep.
Uh-huh.
I'll see you at the office. Good night.
Yes.
Okay. Good night.
Good night??!
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
What?
How can you say that to me?
That's yes?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
You fucking...
It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
It's okay.
You want to come?
It's better when you let me say it.
Go ahead -- what?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I just might.
I'd be glad to help. For $50 an hour.
Oh yeah?
I'm going home!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Um...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
You're breaking my concentration!
What!
Are you a virgin?
Whaddya mean?
I'll pose any way you want.
Anything new?
You know it. I'm out of here.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
He made a cat.
Righto.
A thing I made.
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Let's see it.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
Carla...
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Can some of you guys help me?
Better!
Well I can't say that Walter! She's incomparable. They're both great.
Here here...
There there...
Walter! Jeez!
Sorry...
Yes Walter.
All about me...
Every word...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready? We've got plenty of time.
I know. But I wanted to talk to you.
Bye!
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Oh...f-for a long time. Ever since you first came to the club.
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Forget it.
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Ok...tonight. I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
There's...a body inside that statue!
Don't you see Carla? I made them immortal.
Is it? I've forgotten.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
It was.
What's this sauce! I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
What are you doing here so early?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
I'm totally serious!
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
Oh come on! Even you can see its value.
I admit it.
Why not?
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I do the research.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Let's check out the scene.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Didn't you hear him?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil. Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
What is it, your laundry?
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat? It'll scare people away.
I didn't mean to.
Got carried away, huh?
Enough already about it - get to work!
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A parakeet?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Good night Walter.
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
They are?
What am I doing? I'm just telling Walter the truth.
What, Mr. De Santis?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.
You didn't mean to what?
You want me to open a window or something?
N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
Yeah and what would I say?
It was.
Just wait till you see this!
You made...a bust... WALTER Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Put it down, Walter.
Never mind...
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
No...look I'm busy...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Uh, hi.
Hi. I know you! I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yes, you have. Can I come in?
Uh, sure.
Did you see my cat?
Yeah I did.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl. She's kind of strange, though.
Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure you don't want a pancake?
You can cut the crap.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Huh?!!!
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Who's the head honcho! Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska! What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk! Heroin!
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up. It doesn't fly with me.
I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Relax!
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
Well I'm overjoyed.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Call me...Maxwell.
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Uh, I don't know.
Good morning Walter!
No thanks. Sounds good though.
Suit yourself.
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
I don't! But fifty thou? That's not money, that's manna!
What do you get?
Your work, the layers of irony.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
With Dead Cat?
T-turned on?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Then let me give you something then...
Let it inspire you. Maybe it will let you think of me.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker? What noise?
Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.
What's the matter with you!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic. Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
Shut up! You let him have it!
Cheer up. You may still.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Stay away from my thang. Sorry, honey. 'Thing.'
Litter, yeah!
I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Coach knows what abs are?
What's with you?
Let's move out!
Yes!
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
He's got a... What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.
Thanks. Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
Wrong answer! No prize.
Oh, yeah. But I still want to know what happens.
That's it, man. That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Amazing!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?' I'm just wondering.
We hate you guys!
Bummer metaphor.
You didn't like them.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.
You think? Split?
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
I'm fine.
You look like shit, Benny.
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yes.
Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels.
Wheels?
My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
Down there.
What's playing there?
Yeah, I guess.
Probably. What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
Guys. Guys! Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit...
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Aren't we the chatty ones. Kiss noise.
I... yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
Mmmnkay.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Nothing. It was just a dream.
Hi.
Jealous?
I do? I guess I do.
Where were you last night? I called your house like four times.
I went to sleep. I think I have the flu or something.
So I noticed.
Jeffrey. Projectile vomit.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home. Like always.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here. Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
No...
I am so sure.
It could happen.
Buffy.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
It was. I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.
You want some water or something?
Water. Okay.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.
God! Unbelievable. Vampires.
Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing. It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Mmkay.
Yeah?
I know.
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I think I could help. You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him.
Who?
Merrick...
I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me.
Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
Dress, huh? What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
What for?
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
I should have known.
Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it. Cassandra's my friend.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Bogutude. Blow it off.
I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Like my homework.
) What do you think?
Please. It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
Well, where?
Please. They show previews for foreign movies.
Nice ensemble!
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Where?
Cafe Blase.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get a boob job.
I forgot.
This isn't important? The earth is our home.
Get out of my facial.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know. I like your little outfit.
I'm sorry. That was impressive. The... tumbling.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Am I in trouble or something?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
Wait!
Time to do what?
To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In the past. A girl. Maybe... A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave.
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Cramps?
None of your business. God.
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
Skip it.
It's true.
Our purposes.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
Oh, him.
We'll cover it later.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right. Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Okay.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh. I thought... you lead me --
No. You don't do anything. I do it.
Oh. Good.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.
Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Good Lord. What do you study in history?
My nails.
They were vampires?
Same one.
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
Fine.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You are such a wet.
A what?
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
Okay. The important thing is not to panic.
I kind of had to improvise. Sorry about your guitar.
Toasty. You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Football is my life.
You're learning. Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
He knows who I am!
They don't even have Dolby.
That's the plan.
Good enough!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
What, it's not weird. I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
I was just scared is all.
No. It was mondo bizarro.
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
B'bye.
Thanks.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Sorry.
You're having a fling with him?
Nicole...
Later for it.
Hi.
Oh.
So very much.
My parents have money...
Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Swear to God.
I don't understand.
You are much more.
Hi, Grueller.
What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
Could be.
You think so?
Could be.
Good.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
Make me a woman! Yes! Make me a woman!
Jeffrey!
No --
Okay, let's go.
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Throw it out.
Okay.
Nee sitch. No way.
I gotta bail. You coming?
What is she...
Does Jeffrey know?
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
Hey, wait a minute...
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please.
Okay.
Right!
Nice much.
Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about?
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No... You want me to give him a message?
I don't think so.
All right. Take care of yourself.
I am.
Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
Run.
I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
What?
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch.
Catch?
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
My right nostril?
I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's"--
Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
A little better.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
I know what it is.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Sure. Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
I'll be back when we lose.
it's okay..
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
Yeah, Skip, it's me. Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
That's great!
How can I possibly thank you?
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Don't worry.
That's better. Got the radar ready?
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
He's a virgin.
Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
I don't trust a man who don't dance. It ain't natural.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn. C'mon--
G'night.
I'm not interested yet.
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
So...Wanta make love?
You're pulling your hips out.
Let me.
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Annie, I think you should leave.
No.
Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you gonna play forever?!
I heard already.
I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Not yet. It takes years of practice...
What?
Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Three-fourteen? Hmmm... Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
What's it say?
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson--- Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
He'll learn.
Uh oh... Can I offer you some coffee?
She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will ...
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody! Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
The socks? It's cold in here.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You a God damn witch?
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You missed him!
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Try it! Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker!
Beg me!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Beg me again!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're a cocksucker!
You're outta here!
Don't think.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
How?
I told him.
Yep.
"Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time. We're almost home.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.
You're the boss.
Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Learn your cliches. Study them. Know them. They're your friends.
Boring.
Yep. So how's Annie?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
My right.
What?
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I know. I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
You too...Meat.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Crash, shut the door.
Love to--
Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Hit me in the chest with this...
Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
We'll be praying for you.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it. I gotta run--
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
You can do anything you want. Hop in.
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? Jose, what's this sign?
Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
...and one helluva guy.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
It's a damn convention.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
Where does he go?
Well, I'd rather not say.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
...he did what he was told.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
I can't believe you're doing this.
Hello, Senator.
Good to see ya. William would you...
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
I was in the building!
A powerful man.
Philip, if you would rise.
I'm serious. No interference.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
I can't do that.
Excuse me.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
The worst was Blue.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
All right, take care.
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Lester...
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Mm-hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
Right back.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Okay.
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Oh, no, please, please.
I don't know.
Ohhh...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
How did Nicky collect?
Eight.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Hey.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Ginger.
Honey, come here.
You mean, I have your permission?
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
No.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Ho- Hey, come here.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
Why, somebody's complaining?
All right.
Nope, there's no way.
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's...
...very difficult to get in.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Hey.
You should say so.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
All right.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Listen, I would -
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Please...
...to me.
...don't do it to me...
She came to talk to me...
Okay?
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
That's right, yeah.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
And at the...
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Why?
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Yeah.
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Nick?
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
Well...
Well...
She's there with you? She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.
I'll be right there.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
You bet.
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
And they were usually right.
Good to meet you.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Yeah, refill'd be great.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind. Do you unders-
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Half - I'm comin' down.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
...position...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
...and she doesn't always -
No. Just stop everything.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Certainly. Senator.
Why not make them happy?
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Call security.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Who's this?
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Okay.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
See you, Ginger.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
But mostly...
Good luck.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
Understand? I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying.
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Oh...
Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Oh, fabulous.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
What do you need?
You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Yeah.
Why do you need that much?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
What?
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
What's it...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
All right...
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine. I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Get out of here!
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
Oh. I got your cigarettes.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Mm.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door? Are...
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You fuckin' whore!
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I want you to let me go.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
Get up! Get going! Get up!
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you!
You get down here!
Just wait there for me!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I am not!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you threaten me!
I'm not -
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Oh, you are...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
I am calm!
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children!
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
There was nothing to it. It was my pleasure.
Mr Rothstein.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' I'm firin' you, you -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
So, you're a righty?
Ye-yeah.
God!
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Get out of here.
Thank you.
Mm.
...I got muscled on the street.
Mm.
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Thanks, Nick.
Yeah, thanks.
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Yes.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
I'll to the FBI!
He won't...
I understand.
He won't let me go in my house!
Please.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Jeff, would you go in with her?
And here. Here.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Hey!
Okay.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Now move along.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
Here we go!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Nicky, I did -
Is that what you did?
I did - I didn't -
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick! Fuckin'...
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He tries to do everything...
Is that the last one?
Fuckers!
Great!
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
I'm over here now.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
We can't help him if -
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
But I'm just trying to leave.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I know.
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
I know.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I'll tell him, Remo.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Are you sure?
I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Okay. Frankie, you're a good boy.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay?
All right.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Yeah.
Fine.
Want me to take this for you?
Pleasure. Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah, no shit.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Mm, you want to steal it?
All right?
Yeah. Thanks.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
Yeah.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Bye.
What? What?
Nothin'.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't -
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Mm-hm.
You know?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Exactly.
Yes, you did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
Sure did.
Everything went to his head.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Exactly. He hates me.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. Don't cry.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Yeah.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
All right, all right.
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Okay, yeah.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
I told you I was hot tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What's the matter?
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost?
Yes.
Get lost?
Yes.
Come on!
Okay?
Yeah.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
I am.
I love you.
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Promise?
God... I wish you...
You do?
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Uh, talk to you later. Bye.
It means I got the money.
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Right.
Here.
He was just on the phone.
He called you right here.
I just talked to him.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
'Go! Go! Go!'
No, I'm gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
I think that's it.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Oh, there aren't? What's that? Huh? What's that. There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.
All right.
Two.
Two?
You know why, right?
Yeah.
Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are! Okay, eat.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Of course.
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
I took care of everybody.
Yeah?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Hey, Shelly.
Stacy.
This is Nick.
Pleasure.
Remo.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
It's up to you.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.
So are we.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Let's get out of here.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
Go fuck yourself.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Shh. Hide her car in the back!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No, no, no, no!
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights! Fuck me?
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Kill you, You motherfucker you! Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman -
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
I'm sorry.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I know it, I know it.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Then do it the way you want.
Yeah.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
It's okay. Let her go.
Ayy! Some cat's blocking the periscope. Somebody, give it a swat...
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
This looks promising...
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
In women?
Guilty. I am.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I don't know. I can't remember.
I wonder..
You're probably right.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
No it's not.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
You're serious? You'd help me...
I lied.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But it's true! You can call him yourself.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time. Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man! The blimp is still on schedule, right?
What do you want from me?
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
The "skylight?" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
"Well done," Cactus.
Why am I still troubled...
What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Now he'll be up all night...
I know.
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
Spear.
Men, huh?
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Did you just say "girls?"
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Ask me another one--
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Stop.
How much?
Enough.
Oh now this one is mine...
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
What did--?
You turned around!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Actually, yes.
What?
Nothing. How's your hand?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
Uh-huh..
I'll let you know.
But I'm blind.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Thanks.
Any place.
This is one way.
I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
That's all we need. Better let me drive.
This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I didn't hurt you.
You couldn't hurt me. But it's the principle.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Theo wants to talk again.
Did you have to tell her my name?
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry. You'll do all right without me. Keep my share.
You could've killed us.
We've already got an ambulance on the way. Don't try to get out.
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job.
You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side.
Yes sir.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Bear right till the fire road ends. It's not far.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists.
You never miss a trick.
It's taken care of.
That's your "rep."
Wait! I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit. There's the hotel. You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then. I'm covering the receiver. She can't hear.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine. Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Allow me.
There's a taxi stand here. I can meet you.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
I was worried about you. Both of you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone. For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
And what're you whispering for?
I can't talk any louder. They might hear.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up! Do it!
No -- nothing.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up. I may lose you for a minute.
I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn.
Please.
Shit!
Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel, my daughter. She's an honor student at Parker. My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Bottom line! There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
They don't know you. They won't listen.
Forget who I am. Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Just hang on. I've got a life of my own.
Another minute.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Well you did.
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo?
I've lost you. You're gone. I can't hear anything.
I'm making my turn. I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Great. Stay with me. There must be a hundred kids out here.
That's not her.
No.
I've got to ask somebody.
She's gone --
Don't say anything. Don't alarm them. Just go!
I'm trying to.
It's not your fault, Theo. You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.
What do you mean?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
It's not hard to do. I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't talk. Don't talk!
What's going on?
The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
You can't give up.
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so. Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs. There must be an extension. Oh my God --
Don't panic. I might be wrong. Hello? I guess I was wrong.
Try what you did before. It worked before. I won't talk anymore.
Lucky for them they didn't.
What did you do?
Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
That's coming off. How about the girl?
Yes.
Put the man back on.
She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
I'm sorry. You've thought this out better than I ever could. I'm ready now.
Just start walking. Come on. Walk to me.
Shit. I'm sorry.
Include me in that.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.
You're going to let them get away with this?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
Damned if I know.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
You timed that beautifully.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going!
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I thought it was inspired.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved. Oh shit! Fuck!
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
L.A.P.D.
Shit. You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You could've hit me.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
259-7881.
Dial him up. We need him to run interference.
Ask them.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
The money, Nels ... ?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
How about "later?"
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Only one way to find out.
That's how it's going to be.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Nothing but CDs in there. I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Took preparation.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over! Pull over someplace.
Toss them -- one at a time. I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I don't want it.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Who is this?
You mustn't hang up.
I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.
Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family.
Whatever you say.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
It's a nice day. How about the beach?
Pass.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
We can be there.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Got a phone in that van?
Sure.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I wish it had never been invented.
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
Fucking "A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here.
Just relax.
I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on.
You'll see her.
I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Talk to the man.
I still don't see you.
My pleasure --
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And not a nickel.
I won't let 'em.
That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
She's yours. What are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.
Don't worry.
Put the girl on.
Better reassure him.
Call me "Nels."
I think I've already had a "quickie." Thank you.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
My compensation! Somebody still owes me -- big time!
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Take the 405 south.
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Where's the backpack?
Stay put! I know my way around.
Them. They won't be expecting us.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Mind if I have a look?
Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Doesn't everybody?
Government business?
Very official. 259-7881, if I recall.
Undercover.
I thought so.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
From here on, I dish it out.
Yeah.
Is that good or bad?
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
Thanks.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
I'm sorry.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Did he?
Yeah?
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Hi, Jimmy.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Ask him yourself.
Hi.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Did I?
You fucking did.
You heard me --
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.
Cunt.
Charming.
It's Dave.
Please, Dil --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
He wants to know do I mean that.
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
What?
Whatever it is she does for you.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
It's a simple question.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Not in my experience.
Off his wages.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
No.
Not English.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Must be.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Half-five. At Millie's.
What look?
The one you gave me in the Metro.
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be.
How special?
You want one?
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
Did you do that to him?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
That's good...
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
Like you're concerned.
Didn't think I could.
A real gentleman...
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
All the time.
No...
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Where?
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
I'm working on it.
Stop it, Jimmy.
A little.
Sorry.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Only if you kiss me.
Delirious.
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Okay.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
Not here.
You following me?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You got the keys to the shop?
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
What?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
For you...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
I was trying to get out of something.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
You mean that?
Yes.
My pills...
Prescription. For my condition.
What condition?
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
What?
Don't go like that.
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
Did you hear me?
In a manner of speaking.
It was you...
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Okay.
Let me go, Dil
Got to be somewhere.
Try and go, then.
Let them come then.
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More what?
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Anything.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Never.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Fergus.
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Don't call me that --
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Please, Dil --
What's that supposed to mean?
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Aha.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
He's hot.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
It's your decision.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I told him.
Are you all there?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
And do you know why?
Why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Peter.
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.
Fuck you, too --
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Just a girl.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good.
A hotel?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
So it's on the street.
Right.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
No fucking way.
Only joking.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
So I've noticed.
What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
Kill me.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
She's not my type.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
The fastest.
Toffs' game there. But not at home. .
My pleasure, Jody
Tree.
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Give us a break.
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
I don't know her.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
How can I?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
Tell me something, anything.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
No.
Why?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
What?
Hurling --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You don't know me, do you?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You didn't?
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
Whatever you say, Jude...
It was fun while it lasted.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
You're crazy --
Give me the fucking shooter!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
Yes, but --
I think that's what you ordered.
Oh!
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
What about it?
It's lovely.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
How do you think I got here?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Well -- come on.
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Open up.
Why?
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
The letter --
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Yes, you told me.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Of course there is!
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Look.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be an idiot!
I'm through listening to you!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
Here, give it to me.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
No thanks.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
May I have a sandwich, please?
So that was it.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
His -- real -- ?
Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Thanks very much.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
Oh.
Were you followed?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
Barely, yes.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
But no one actually saw him die.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Me? Why me?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
1944. The next face, please.
No.
Next, please.
No.
The last one, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
No, thank heaven.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Around one.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
The view had better be worth it.
That's the idea.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
Or you -- Or you --
I'll take that.
Reggie?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. Ouch!
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There -- you're a new man.
You can't.
There must be some way.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Said what?
Okay.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Oh.
I think I love you, Alex --
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
No.
Maybe.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Why?
Who?
I'm sorry.
Alex --
Hm?
I'm scared.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
No --
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
The shower's in there.
I dare you.
I don't think I know that one.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Yes.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
In money.
Forty-five thousand.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
And if it is?
Why bother him?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Not unless we're blind.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Leave me alone -- !
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
But his mother --
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm very cold.
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know. I'm sorry.
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded. Sylvie!
Okay.
What should we give him?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh. Neither do I. Voil !
Voil what?
Up there! I would put it up there!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
We won! We won!
No, Jean-Louis.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis -- where?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Now you're angry.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
The man and the woman are married --
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Lay on, MacDuff.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I don't think I follow you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
I wasn't --
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What was what?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
On the street where you live.
How about once more around the park?
What?
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
The man you had the fight with.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Good night.
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
I don't understa--
Wha -- what do you want?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
Va jouer, mon ange.
a alors! From Charles?
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
Because I don't love him.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't you want me to stay?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
He's allergic to him.
The American Embassy.
Oh la vache!
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
What?
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
We will separate -- you look over there.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He took care of Charlie for us.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
You do?
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
I get the imports.
Ok!
Good.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?
That's impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
It won't happen again.
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I will. Is that all?
What's wrong?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
You never went, uh, all the way?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.
You are upset.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Are you sure?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Run!
No. I'll handle this.
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She just turned off her light.
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
This will relax her.
She's underage.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.
She works at a church?
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I can.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
No.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No, you couldn't.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
You're not?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Who's?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Sure.
You know about that too?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
I really do. For your own safety.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes.
You think you're my sister?
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
OK. increase the peace.
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
No.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.
Follow me.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You heard about that?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
You Miss Dunlop?
No.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
What?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'll think about it.
Yes!
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I don't know. I kind of am.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
This party is sick.
What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
I love you.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
What?
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
The library. I'll be fine.
Who is she?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
What?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
How could you?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
The principal?
Yes.
Who was the fourth?
Are you Jody?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
Just thinking about something.
What?
I got to go.
What?
I'm worried about someone.
And she didn't?
Hi Sandy.
Did you want one?
No, you keep one.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
What?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD!
Okay, okay.

Freezer in the back.
Great.

No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today. New policy.
Andy. Another fuckin'...

Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart...
...and fair...

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...

Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I...
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...

Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
All right.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....

All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be...

I need your truck!
You are not takin' my truck!
Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe.
What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Come on, get in the truck.
Are you kiddin'?
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.

Do you wanna give me a minute?

Oh, man.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
Shut up.
We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.
Fine.
...-damn!
Okay, okay!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no. Keep goin'.
Okay.
Shut up.
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work! It's not even load-...
...-ed.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
All right.
Okay! All right!
Okay.
Nice job back there.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
No...
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift. You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--! The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
Yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.
...truck!
Shut up, shut up! It's beeping.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
You snatch that phone from me one more time, I'm--
Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream.
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up! Back...
...up!
...Pete! Come on! There it...
...is, old Pete! Come on, baby!
All right, you got it.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?! You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide! Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we don't make it?!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right. Now, move!
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey. Oh, please, Pete. Please don't do this to me. Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
I'm goin'. I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over! Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit. Come on, old...

Come on, old Pete. Oh.
I know the likeli-...

Come on, old...
...Pete. Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.
All right, you got it, you got it!
Whoo!
I made it!
I made it.
What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit. You gotta pass him.
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
Okay. That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Oh...
...ho!
...shit!
Hey!
Go on.
Go, go.
Come on.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. It's okay. Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Okay. Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Aw, shit
...to him! You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
You're--? What?!
Then stay...
...here!
Oh, shit. Okay. Come on.
What?
Come on!
Oh, shit.
Okay. Okay.
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
What?
This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'.
Worth a try.
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...
...stole the truck.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Yeah.
You know.
We were nationally ranked.
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it. So I split.
And things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er. It was your friend...
...Long. Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Split? I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
Hey. Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
A-And you owe me...
...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
No.
Huh?
They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Reach into my pocket.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right. Okay.
Go, go, go!
That's why I didn't give it...
...to him.
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!
...on!
...-ful?!
Okay. Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
Okay.
I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What the--?
You've gotta be...
I'm gonna kill him.
What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.
It says forty- nine.
What?
It's melting, man.
It's working.
...-ta get outta here!
Vitelli! Vitelli!
There's gotta be...
...another way outta here. Hey.
Hold this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go!
Go.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay. Come on, big guy!
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it.
Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg.
Always the negative...
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us. Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet Owes us a little restitution.
I think so too.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face. I was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
Look. That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
But he didn't. See, that's negotiation.
No.
That's bullshit.
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
Ooh.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Yeah.
Yeah.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
That's right.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool. Be--
That was quick.
...about him.
I'll keep an eye out.
...within five minutes.
It's for you.
Don't be tedious, waiter. Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Oh, my God.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds. One...
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Vaughn.
Hey!
So...where's my truck?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...help you?
Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. Whatever you want. Please!
Mason, you have to take this...
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...here. Mason...
You-You can't let him...
...have it. You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Hey, actually...
...-lem too?
No, sir. I've never seen this guy before.
What the hell's a sage?
He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Bullshit. Put the phone down, Mason.
...Mason. I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice!
Hold it!
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
Us. Owe us.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
However, you are also non-en-...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...including the permanently extreme.
I'd say we're about even.
Are you crazy?! Take the boat?!
Is it--?
Looks like it. Yes, sir.
Alert seventy-fifth rangers. Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Any of them Richard Long?
No, sir.
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're...
Now listen to me.
Now, I know. You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You have my word on that.
All right. One more shot, provided... we're off the island tonight.
Let's proceed.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!
Damn you, Long! My people are out there! Your people are out there!
It's too...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
Is that why you're here? To blame...
...me? Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I--
Went away?
"Went away." I like that.
Almost quaint.
All right. After they put you away...
So far, ye-yes.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...-ians. But I assure you, Leo...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle.
Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
Closin' down, sir.
All right. Let's clear the mess and move out.

What about these two?
We're gonna use them for demonstration footage.
Sir.

We were called in by the Jerome base...

...-ty.
Right. Tim Mason.
You know the suspect?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
Richard Long.
That's right.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
But...
...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain. Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Assumptions are always dangerous.
...Long.
Doc Long. Yeah, I know him. Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.
...should be right outside.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go.
I don't know what the hell...
...and ask a simple question - Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man. Get yourself some CDs.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
You try anything, it goes in...

Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...

You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.

Oh. Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Mm. It doesn't take a genius.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...like April. It gives him gas. And make sure there's two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in. I got it...
...somehow.
There's something else too.
Uh, we both like to fish.

Ah.
You got thirty minutes.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Go.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
Kabula's out.
EXT. DAM - DAY.

...tight!
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Here's what I want you to do.
Get ready to take it out!
Negative. Negative.
...son.
All right. Enough. Look...
It must've happened right after we left.
After that re-...
Uh-huh.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
I will tell you what I...
...colonel?
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.
Run a check. FBI, Interpol.
It could be a cover, I suppose.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...try this one out some-...
...-time.
Excellent.
My secret?
No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis. He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
Shit! Oh, shit.
No...
...or it'll ignite.
Cold? Cold. How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
Everything will die, Mason.
The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.
Doctor.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
Let me have those.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
I don't know. Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
...miles.
What?
Yeah, yeah...
...-son.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
We've got the real thing!
Where are you now...
...Mason?
I'm at mile marker...
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
God! They're gonna seal it.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope. Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors. I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
That's not the way I...
I didn't sell the boy any...
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...to talk, son.
You know, I gotta tell you. That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...hands!
Pappas! Move the car!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...stole a truck under arrest.
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right out-...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!
The Army, sealin' us in.
Jesus.
I'll lead 'em out.
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
Fol-...
The usual. Doc.

Heat's murder.
Take it easy, Jake.
An honest living.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Row twenty-three, section C.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
A ruler?
I said horseshit. Horseshit.
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
Thanks.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Probably.
I think I gave it to her.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
None.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Was he right?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.
No.
When was the last time?
What about her?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Avocado groves?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
With her mother.
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
I think I'll kill her.
Oh they don't?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
I'll throw that in too.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Jake, listen.
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
I said okay, Jake.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.
Well you own a lot of land.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
The apple core?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
But what?
How are you, Lou?
Yeah, they are.
How'd you get past the guards?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
I get by.
Since I made Lieutenant.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
Or her name?
No.
No?
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't.
Let me show you something.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
How did she... ...happen to have them?
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Absolutely.
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
Shut up. Go on.
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
An accident?
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Do you know where she might be?
Certainly not!
Yes.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
What?
I said I'll drop it.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
How did you find out?
My husband.
He told you?
I was grateful.
Why?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
I don't believe you.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny. I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say. Get my car, please.
Oh.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
What dam?
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
What? What is it?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
They can't be.
They may not know it but they are.
Get in the car.
Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
When was the last time?
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Doing what?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
They do in Chinatown.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...No. Why was it.
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's not tied up!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I am not!
Then let's go talk to her.
What about?
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
I will if you don't.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
She's my sister and my daughter!
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How about a plane?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Okay...
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
He's in the dark room.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Okay.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Oh, good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I'm sorry, I --
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Hope so. He's working for us.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
I don't understand.
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes...
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
Si.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
What about the water?
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
That's a long fall.
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L.A. River?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Who?
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
But...
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Water and Power?
Yeah. Do you have any references?
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz. And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
He owned it.
Yes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
I don't want Mulvihill. I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
No, you have a press agent do it.
But that's what you told your wife.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
It tastes wonderful!
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Come in, Alfredo.
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth... There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Elena. ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
For what?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
No...
Then where's the money?
Somebody stole it.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself. Send it right away.
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
That's all there is.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
Two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Oh!
I'll write it myself.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
I might make him nervous.
That's a long story.
Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very! Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all -
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Yes.
Certainly not.
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Are they standing for me?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Ask them to sit down.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
We've got a nice plant here.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.
And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.
It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Emily -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
It's - all over -
Charles.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
No, it can't. Good night, darling.
It may not be about anything at all.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
No.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
Charlie, please don't -
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Hmm!
You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
No. They've passed on.
In the water.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I know... But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier. Here.
Thanks.
No. But you're close.
A rooster?
You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Well, I -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Yes.
You can't stop me.
Don't go, Susan.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.
You can't.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Where'm I going?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Yes, sir -
Can't say, sir.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Not my wife - not either of them.
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia. It belonged to a king.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Good.
Yes?
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?
Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
I've got to think of Emily -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Go ahead.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
I'll get you some coffee.
She's going to leave you -
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Yes.
Hello, Charlie - I didn't know we were speaking.
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It is. Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Yes.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially - That's the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Hey, Nurse!
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Yes, sir.
Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
Good!
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight. As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.
Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Think again!
I had a toothache.
What do you mean?
Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I'll have a highball.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You're shittin' me.
You think I'm shitting you...
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
I'll just take the gum.
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Sure. Go ahead.
How long have you been a smoker?
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Exactly.
So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Just now.
My God. I haven't seen you since...
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Well... kind of, sort of?
How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
So you're really getting married?
No.
No, you're not really getting married?
Was I right?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
What?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fianc.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy. See you later, handsome.
I left like an hour ago.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Um... okay.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
No.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
I'm not fooling around! Who went back there?
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
Oh God...
What time was this?
Um... I don't know. What time did hockey end?
Just me.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
In a second!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
I can pass!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I'll assess all I want!
I can whip your ass.
Yes.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
To the back, above the oil. How long are you staying?
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
Lenin's Tomb.
Annoying Customer.
What's your point?
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
No, thanks.
I wanted to use your car.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
What do you two fight about?
You win.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
That's frightening.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Oh yeah.
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think it's safe to say yes.
You, Veronica, Caitlin... ...and Caitlin's fianc.
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
How do you mean?
There's more?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Wait.
She's in here?
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
All of them.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Veronica!
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
What?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I don't back down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
You've got a customer.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Can we not talk about this?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.
Then where're we gonna play?
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Listen to you.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Her fucking body fell out!
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
What?
Not yet.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
You're bullshitting.
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Holy shit. That girl?
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Hey, what about Veronica?
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I'll read the book.
Fuck you.
Could be.
Shut the fuck up!
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What time did we go to the funeral?
I think four.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I was born.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave her out of this.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
It's hard to swallow.
Thanks.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What time did you get to work today?
Like ten after.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
You need a ride?
Got one. Just pulled up.
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
Just the paper.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Excuse me?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Yeah?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
To you?
I... I don't believe this...
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I'm not dealing.
Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
A half hour.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Nothing personal.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Maybe.
She's my girlfriend.
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
The white kind.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
I said go ahead.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
Why do you say that?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
Something wrong?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Where?
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
How many?
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven?! My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
A few?
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Goodbye, Dante.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. Hi, Randal.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
What time do you get finished?
Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
It stings a little.
Yes. I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
What?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
WHAT?
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
Swear. Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
You gotta hear him sing. Olaf, "Berserker!"
Wait, there's more. Olaf: sing...
Does he sing in English or Russian?
English. Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
He is.
No way!
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
Now feel his. Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Because he's out of shape.
Shit! Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Yeah!
That's sick, Dante.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Well, how about these two movies?
No, I wasn't.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You hope what feels good?
You'll be missed.
Screw you!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.
I'll see you there.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I... I don't know what to say.
You're not?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Dental School.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
All right, asshole, you're on.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
I will. Take it easy.
Bye.
Bye That was Snowball.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today. C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder. C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
More bang for the buck.
Fuck you.
Cursin'. That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
A monkey?
It can't fly in this weather.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
Bags?
A bad climb, no, just another challenge. What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Hey, fuck you.
No, stay off the line! You'll break her loose!
The clip's not gonna hold!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second. Jesus Christ, grab her!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
I did what I thought was right.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
If you want, do it. I don't care.
Would you?
My pleasure.
Near Freedom Falls. She went for help.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah. I know you did what you could--
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Is it really four thousand?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Sure you can.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
One...
That's it, you look like a professional.
Three...
Nice and easy...
Six...
I'm here! Sarah, I'm here! I'm here--I've got you!
Help me! I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die. Grab me with your other hand!
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Wait, I think I have them sighted. What's the word, Frank?
Just hangin' out.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
Enough.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Where've you been?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
I know...
I don't think you do.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
Listen to you... The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is... I'm late for my shift.
Jess--you look good.
That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.
He can handle it.
What if he can't?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
You mean the nerve.
I only came back for you.
What are you doing here!?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Yeah, let's go.
Excuse me?
What about you?
Don't worry about me, just go.
Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Want me to lead?
Cute.
Breathtaking.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
No, not really. Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
We gotta get out and fire a flare. It's the only chance!
What?
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
Jess, c'mon...
Hold on! Hold on! Reach up!
Don't let me fall!
Do it, goddammit!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
I don't know. I don't know.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What about you?
Hand-holds?! I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
I won't do it. No way.
Take the rope.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
There's a lot more where that came from. You're not leaving again?
And miss all of this peace and quiet? Never, right Hal?
Good memory. You must be great with numbers.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.
Now you get burned.
What the hell's going on?
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be. Walk over.
Sue me.
There is.
I'm touched. Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
It looks like a winding route.
There. You blind?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Then it's a deal.
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Let's move your ass in there!!
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Why? What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
There, what's that place?
I haven't even got on it yet. Let's go, time to fetch.
We agree on something. And for insurance, take his coat.
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
He can't be far away. Find him. Go!
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Give me the fucking code!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Richard Travers.
Appreciate it.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
We should be. Everybody wants what we have.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
No, my health doesn't allow it.
And you, sir?
Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
How do you do, sir?
Hullo.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
Alex.
Hullo love, how are you? Nice to see you, Dad.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Good.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Thank you, sir.
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well - I'm back.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh, aye, aye.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
No, sir.
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Yes, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
How're you feeling this morning?
Fine... fine.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Something like that.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Yes?
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
How many did I get right?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
Indeed.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Prison custody?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Thank you.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
You got a deal.
No. I got lucky with the lights.
No. You were right, I was wrong... ...Max.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Let me guess. Clarinet?
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Like what?
Travel...and things.
You psychic?
Big case?
Yeah.
Most of the time.
But not now?
Just had one.
Dozen times a day.
Sure thing.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
Max? Oh... ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<u>Kill</u> you! He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section. What should I do?
Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...
Yes.
Comin' over Coldwater. Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me. You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way.
I'm...fine. Fine.
You sure? You look pretty shaky...
Right through those doors. The man himself.
Jesus...
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here! You and Louis?
'Fraid so.
I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet?
It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.
Then let's have it.
Sorry?
Can't say that I do.
I think...
I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Federal?
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.
By the way. Daniel said he was sorry.
Pretty quiet down there. A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Take him down. Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Months now. He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What thing?
Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.
So? It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Oh?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
No harm done, ma'am.
Oh, call me Ida. To what do we owe the pleasure?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.
What's your name?
Vincent...
Try?
Of course!
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
You couldn't pick up a phone? I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are. He's artistic.
Vincent. It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Yo, whassup?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
Tell it to Max. Tell him he's an asshole.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Maaaaaax!
Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Max! Dammit! <u>Answer!</u>
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
Oh. Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
Twenty-four? Not twenty-five? Or twenty-three?
You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in.
Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.
None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers.
Yeah. Lucky with the lights.
Max.
Max? I'm Vincent.
You always stutter?
Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.
You're cool.
No. You say you're cool.
I'm cool.
With what?
I don't think I can do this.
It's just a dead guy. On three, ready? Uno. Dos. Three.
Yeah.
His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!
It's a spasm! Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
I'm trying...
It's not me.
Yes! I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous. I'm the one with a schedule.
Okay, try it now.
What?
Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.
I think so.
It's a mess.
So?
South Central.
How long, you figure?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
You don't understand. I mean it. Really. I'm not up for this...
Yes.
What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Sex? Breathe.
Play music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing. I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa.
How?
You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
Believe it.
Good luck. You think they got families?
I'll deal with it. I will, I will...
Because I have a gun and I say so.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident. I'm not liable.
I can't do that. He's the Man. He'll fire my ass.
So what?
I need the job.
No you don't.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
What?
Collateral damage.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
Jazz. Music.
I listen to classical.
Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...
You mind? I'm working here.
No.
What you mean, no?
I'm done. Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
She's in the hospital.
You go every night?
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck! Nothing's ever goddamn good enough! It's always been that way.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse. How many others you got?
Why?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
The man who hired me for this contract.
I don't get it.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No. No way. I can't do this.
Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Why?
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You get benefits?
No.
Paid sick leave?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.
You do impress me, Max. That you do.
Who?
What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
There you go...!
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
...indifferent.
As in...?
Answer the question.
Slow down.
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Who?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials and they're down there.
Any special reason?
Excuse me?
Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.
I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her.
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
The guy came right at us!
You turned up a one way street!
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Just drop me off.
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.
Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mississippi?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sorry, Flip. Got sidetracked.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Sure was. Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
Not testing. <u>Using</u>. Nukes are passe. This is the weapon of the future.
Do you still ride?
Not for years.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.
You were there, Jerry. Figure it out.
Switch the charts.
What?
I'll see you tomorrow.
What is?
Love.
Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Really?
You saved my life.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
Figure of speech. Could we go?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.
Yeah.
Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail.
As opposed to?
Yes.
That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man.
I noticed.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months. Eleven days.
Yeah. I think so.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh... Ooooo...
I have no idea.
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Believe you about what?
Flesh wound. No big deal.
Surprise me.
Um, coffee. If that's okay?
This would be it?
I've been reading up on it.
Are these yours?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who?
Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
Getting rid of my hub!
Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
It was that painting. The one on the wall.
How is it possible?
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Not this again.
What van?
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here in Manhattan.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool. <u>In Newport</u>.
They're big details, Jerry.
You will?
If that's what you want. Yes.
What?
Holes? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Thanks.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
This way.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
What's in Connecticut?
Come on.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.
Then tell me what happened.
Because he believed me.
You do?
I'm sorry.
It's okay. You... You thought I was bad.
Jerry...? <u>Jerry</u>.
You saw me standing alone ...
Without a love of my own.
You knew just what I was there for.
Where are you?
What about you?
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. <u>Now</u>.
It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't do this.
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Now she tells me.
Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well.
That's great. Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know?
Could you be a little more specific?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome. Where's my partner?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She --
That's not what I mean. I want to see her.
I don't know...
Then screw you. I'll rot.
Alright. You can see her. But she can't see you.
Whatever.
A dog bit it.
Excuse me?
You already asked me that. Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
<u>Why you</u>?
Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term. Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them? Why him?
The truth shall make you free.
That's it. I went to Yale. I hope you won't hold that against me.
We're very specialized.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Please, sit.
It was. It was.
And what did I say?
A dog.
<u>My dog</u>. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Yes, that's right.
Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed --
I don't believe you.
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's. Kept it in his wallet. He was murdered --
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
You sound so sure.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Working.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
Night after that?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Too bad. Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Agent Lowry?
Not today...
It makes perfect sense. Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't like it. Something's wrong.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
You don't understand --
I don't know. Didn't see him.
I was just thinking that.
No. Not yet.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
Your call. Have a good night.
Go ahead. We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
What do you mean?
You think we have time to fool around like this? Come on.
Nothing. I was just making sure. So, who are you?
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.
Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
Pull the plug. Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
What?
He died... ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
How is that possible? How could all that information be encoded in --
It's a hoax. I knew it!
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Glad to have you, David. How's the new office?
Still settling in, really. Where's Dr. Arroway?
Tell me.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
No, thanks.
Oh? How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Really? Congratulations, by the way.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
No doubt.
Ellie...
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
You were right, Ellie. You were right all along.
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
What?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
This... seemed best.
Right. Well.
Good luck, David.
Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you?
It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
And?
No primer.
How can that be?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
Ellie. Pulsar?
1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Nice. Where?
This is how you see the sky?
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's a civilian facility.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is it possible. Yes. But --
Thank you, Doctor. Now --
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
I can't move any smaller.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain. Find out where he is.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
Okay, okay... there.
That's a beauty, Captain. Now get some sleep.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
That's my scientist.
Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The librarian... or the library...?
Now... you go home.
No! I mean... why so soon?
No. Please.
Childhood is over, Ellie. It's time to grow up.
That's my girl... Lights.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
It's so... small.
What are you talking about? It's over.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
Mmm. Look closer.
That's what they all say.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Yavol.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.
But what about your research -- ?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Peter.
You too.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Like it. Almost there.
I'm -- I'm fine.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
What day?
How long was I gone?
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
How do you mean?
And mind, yes. What are you --
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
Did you love him?
Yes. Very much.
Prove it.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Some of my best friends are scientists. They're saying the machine is alive.
I don't think so.
Why?
In other words.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
Really.
Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
It's late. We should go back.
How do you mean?
The final countdown.
Oh. I brought you something.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
Please --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
-- I don't know --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
I do.
In other words.
What is it?
Git your shovel and git to work.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
Cut that backsass!
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I'll make it a dollar.
Buck is a deal.
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
That's good: he earned it.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Ram it in and break it off!
You steal a car?
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I don't know, Boss.
You don't know!
I... I... I...
Git to work!
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Yes, Boss.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
She's got him! You hear that?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Hey, Tattoo!
You jes' watch us!
Borrowin'.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Tramp! Beautiful!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Pair'a nines.
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
So then you just call him.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
What for?
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
You tryin' to say somethin'?
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Cool Hand Luke.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Like an elephant.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
What you mean, Luke?
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter.
Call.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
Well, how far didya get?
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
How about you tryin' to make me?
Oh for...
What are you talking about?
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
None of your fucking business.
Only kidding!
What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.
Fear of what...
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>! I know it was him!
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure. And guess what else?
But earlier, he was staring up here. <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay. You win. 'Dirty Harry' coming up.
No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
About what?
I know. Do come and meet your guest.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
But </u>alive</u>!
Hal has it.
I'm okay. I really kind of enjoyed it.
'Lying. He was lying.' I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor?
The same as the first time...
What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Yes. I believed him.
Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I was? How you spell that?
Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I never carried a gun!
Doesn't work that way. You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
You already made the delivery?
What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.
I'm trying to tell you. It's on the lady's pillow...
We know... Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
She don't want it.
Something personal. Is he bothering you?
I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
In jail.
That Klutz. They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I think you will.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
No. Not yet.
I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I'm in charge here.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Is he out?
Who?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
What calls? I haven't made any calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
For months... last October.
He felt remorse. He covered her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I want a guard on you. I'm worried about leaving you alone.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off. It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Hello, Ruben... So that's that...
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Because I'm all you've got.
What's that music. It's Abba. I can hear it. It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They weren't going to show it to me?! The arrogance! It's my <u>life</u>!
Where's the john? Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Bundy. That's the last one in your speech...
Maybe you should...
W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...
In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
He's hacked into her Internet address. He's a hacker.
MaryJane. We call her M.J.
Not yet.
No. I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling! I'm going to fall!
Shhh. It's okay. Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Will you stay? Please? I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
Yes. I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
Listen to me. Is there a gas station nearby?
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Go and look for a note.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby. I know.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
We know Helen. She's not exactly a credible collaborator. Especially late in the day...
Who prescribes the brandy?
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone. I know you won't mention it.
I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
Lieutenant Quinn.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're shitting ion your career. You outrank hi...
Yeah. And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Just horseshit luck.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Classy madonna.
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library? Anything but beef.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Tell it to your shrink.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Bunch of Swedish women. You're too young.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Shut up.
I said you were...
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues.
What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
That's always your privilege, sir.
Yessir.
Helen Hudson...
What the hell you need her for?
Because I think I'm wrong.
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Nikko?
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself. Where're you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Thank you.
Well, yes. You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
You're not envious?
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
My last lesson's next week. James... my car...
One of my suitors.
I'd like to go back. James...
Not yet. It's only beginning.
James.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
I work in the immigration department there.
Yes.
Isn't that rather too close...?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
No.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
I can drive.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Yes.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You could get your wish at any moment.
I did this already.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I want to see my mother immediately.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care of myself.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
What?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Oh?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Please, Letty.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
And the party?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
But everything's OK?
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
You look beautiful.
Really?
Truly.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Do you think I should?
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Ecru.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
That's thanks to all your help.
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
Wow. Congratulations.
You've only known Jake a few months.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
But what about Beast? Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Tomorrow?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
You too, Mom.
You're looking good. A little thin, but good.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
When did you start smoking?
Mom, please.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
Don't be fresh.
Just remember that I love him.
There's a spider in my room.
Yeah?
Green spot.
Mottled really. Green and red.
Lie?
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
It's OK. It's good to let it out.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I'm glad.
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal. We all compare.
Who do you think you are?
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
I wasn't hungry.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Paul.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic. He's very romantic.
So are you engaged, or what?
It's magic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
The left one.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Good God.
A small price.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Don't be ridiculous.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
A rose is a rose.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Really? Me too.
What's my rap?
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
What are the delusions like?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
That's where I always go when I get out.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
Your family just met me.
I do.
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
But I do. I love you, too.
Oh, right. I'm ready. How do I look?
Home free.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
And did you go to the mission?
I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
So, it's over?
All over. Did you see your new apartment?
No, I need some serious household advice.
List schmist. You'll remember.
Aren't you ever quiet?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Open up. I want to see.
You like it?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
Really?
Out? Are you kidding? I've got all the fixings here.
I like it. But Headlines are better.
You're so wrong.
It's sex time.
No.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
I'll see you tonight.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Yeah?
You've got one hell of a great body.
Thanks.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Sounds grim.
Yeah. How was the job search?
It doesn't matter. It'll work out.
Promise?
Promise. As long as we have steak.
Steak?
You got wine. That's great.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Congratulations.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Bingo.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
How about a dance?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Always the drugs.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Why'd you tell?
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
It's hard to know where to start.
And all the plans we have.
Yeah, the plans.
Well then why'd it happen?
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything have to be so hard?
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty. I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
How about something better? Like a kiss.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
You should go.
It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
She's only known the guy a few months.
In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Oh, ok. Maybe.
I'm calling in sick.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Come on, Letty. It'll get done.
You just need to get more organized. L
Yes.
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Something you did?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Yes, I suppose so.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
So, what do you say, Let?
So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will. I do.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
That's a load off my mind.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
No.
No way. You keep the ring. You'll come to your senses.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Oh.
How's work going? Are you back at school?
I start on Monday.
I heard about your friend.
What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Michael. Yes.
I'm really sorry.
I do apologize. A student had a crisis.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Office work?
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
I'll float you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Do you know who this is?
Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it. That's why you're here.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass.
Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Not today. Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
I dunno.
What? This?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Marcel?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Should I call you back?
Oui.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Vincent's in the States on business. That it?
Uh, yeah.
Good. I have a job for you in America.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
It's Daniel.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.
Good. I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
No thank you.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Okay. How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Yeah -- you do that.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
And nothing. He's just feeling us out.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Good word.
He missed three weeks.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
But you were there?
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Yes.
I guess we're going to find out.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Not such a good friend. May I reach in my pocket?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
How about if I call you?
You have something for me?
I know they won't be home tonight.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
We can't.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Jesus!
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We'll see.
Cops?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying. It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
We'll think of something.
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning.
No.
You're sure?
Do I?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
I'll be Elvis and you--
That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
No?
He's been shot a lot. He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Does it really matter what I say?
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Guns. Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
-- Don't think. Okay? You're not good at it.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Hard to say.
French guys? You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Just find them!
Okay boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good song though.
Great fuckin' song.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
And the other car?
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
I don't know. I didn't look.
Go look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh yeah.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Go where? The police are outside.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.
Okay. I will have a beer.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
She took everything! Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Relax. It will be fine.
I'm the driver.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I don't know. It's gotta be millions.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Yeah, I can see that.
You lived there. You know the city.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Okay. You can be Elvis.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
God, I want to go home.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Give it to me, Sami.
No!
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Get in the car.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
They sort of got away.
Yeah. It's mine.
No. It's mine.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
Fuck me? Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How?
You see that car?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Watch this.
Oh, you think?
What?
Wait here.
Where is it, Sophie?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.
Glenmorangie is very good.
And you don't speak French?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
You wanna tell him?
I don't know.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
They're not nice people.
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
It's okay. It was a long time ago.
The lucky ones.
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
It's not your fault.
It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
That's good. That's what a stand-up guy does.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
A car.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm? Still sore?
Much better. You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
I didn't have the heart.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Wait! I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Yes.
Then leave her to me.
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
On guard!
Real sharpness comes without effort.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
What's it to you?
Tell me, who is your master?
Let's go!
You're already a thief.
That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
Yes, you do! You are still my disciple.
Long.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
Put them down.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming. I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're a sword fighter too?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
What do you think?
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're probably right.
How so?
I'm bored.
I'll write your name. Just for fun.
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here,
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
You know about Lo?
He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Don't be a sore loser. Go ahead. Take your pick. I'll wait. Go ahead.
Not another lecture! On guard!
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Never!
Then you have no use for the sword.
Jen!
Give it back!
You're tired. You need rest. Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here.
You coward!
Still in a bad mood? At least you're speaking. What's your name?
It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give it back.
I am a man. And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It is trouble for me.
I will.
Jen...
Don't ever come back.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Make a wish, Lo.
It has. How's business?
Good. And how are you?
Fine.
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
Perhaps.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
What have you discovered?
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Then, why did you come?
Well, we had talked...
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I knew she would intrigue you.
She needs direction... and training.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
We followed Jade Fox.
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
My life is departing. I've only one breath left.
I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A murderer?
I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual...
We must avenge mother!
Father!
What does it say?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Was. ALBRECHT This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
I'm buying.
No onions?
They make you fart.
Annie, I need a file.
This is special, darlin'. Please?
Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.
I knew that.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk. that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
No further. I'm serious.
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Fucking A, my friend.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
I saw it, too.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours. A day of life, plus change...
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others. Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
How 'bout the morgue?
No. I have one more thing to do.
This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more.
You're bleeding, man. You can't make it.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
I lost my key.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously. You left the door open.
It can't rain all the time.
Out. Now. I gotta work.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Not me.
I dabble. May I?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
He has a room, upstairs. I don't like him very much.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite.
Does she have a name?
No name. You sure ask a lot of questions.
No.
You gotta go now, I bet.
I have to go.
A remembrance. A closure.
I think he's yours, now.
In a better place. I hope.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?
She's still dead.
Mom tried to cook.
Oh.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Right.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Murderer.
You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
I don't know you...
Victims. Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Take the dope, too.
It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Wrong answer.
Another jolly nickname?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
T-Bird?
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ?
Magic.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Interested? Follow the crow.
Shelly?
Miss her?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Go away.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa. Business.
18k. Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
Leather purse...
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real.
Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.
Is he inside?
No shooting.
Move in, guys.
One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
"Our" Crow...?
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
I'll be fine.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You what?
I know.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Forever.
On my mother's life.
Okay...
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You a lesbo?
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
How do you know I've been with several women?
A friend wrote me.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
You talking to me?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Thank you.
Give me the fucking letter.
Refreshing.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Because you act like a pig.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
No thank you.
How are you today?
Give it up.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.
Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
I'm... I'm alright.
How was your date?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You're not gonna start that again.
I will.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I don't.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't win with you.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Fine.
No.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Why can't we be together?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
Sure.
Yeah, me neither.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I'm sorry about that.
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
- none taken -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Any ideas who it could be?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
The football stud?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
What do you mean?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Are you shitting me?
Outstanding.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Absolutely.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Okay.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks. Nice meeting you.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
What are you scared of?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
I guess. It still sounds gross.
It was nothing.
Eyes closed.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
No.
Well do you like him?
I don't know.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Best friends.
It's Kathryn.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I am?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
That's one way of looking at it.
Cool.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
And then I can go home?
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Some other time, Cecile.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Is it me?
No, you were fine.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I know.
I do.
Don't you want to change that?
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You do?
Yummy.
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Would you please leave.
Honey, is something wrong?
Who told you?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby? Right on time.
Jesus!
Get out of here.
I told you to lock the door.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
One.
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
Yeah?
It's Kathryn.
No.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
What do you mean?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Outstanding.
What?
So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Care to make a wager on that?
I'll think about it...
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
And if I win?
In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
Even there?
It would feel so yummy.
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Blow me.
Call me later.
Okay.
Shhh.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
I hate it too.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Cecile.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
With who?
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
Where is she?
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh come on. For her first time?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Mock, mock, mock.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
And I don't.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Annette?
Well done.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Come again?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Black.
You will be discreet about this?
Absolutely.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Is that so?
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I'll do that.
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I did?
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
Oh... no thank you...
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
Nope.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Don't worry about it.
You're a lucky guy.
She really loves me.
How will I get to her?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
You bastard!
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
At the old house with the voice.
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All right, mommy.
All right, Amy. Go tell Edward to take you.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I know that.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Yes, darling,
No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
That's right.
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
Amy's been lying again.
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
What?
It's your play.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Well, you know where it is.
I suppose so.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
Certain wishes do.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.
It was on account of the birthday party.
Why didn't you run after them?
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Let me be the judge of that.
Voices from an old dark house!
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Because she is my friend.
She's there whenever I call her!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, darling.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
I don't know yet.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
A princess?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
Of course,
That one's an elm.
My dolls. We can pretend.
Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I want to touch it.
Don't cry, Amy.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But, Amy! Amy...I'm dead.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
I'm trying to.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Soon as I finish.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Why hasn't he got a head?
Good.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you hear it?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Yes, yes -
I can't do it! I can't do it!
My daughter died long ago.
Anybody could know that song.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
That's from her -- that woman.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
And Amy mailed them?
She pleaded so to do it
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Can we get some service here?
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
I've changed a lot lately.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Never felt better.
At Victoria's Secret.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
Nearly four.
How have you been feeling?
No it's mom.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe he's just shy.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
And my bra finally fits again.
My vision got worse again.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
I wonder if he's married.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I looked like an Italian man!
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
You're just saying that.
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
No you don't, believe me.
No they're not.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I haven't gotten it yet.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
Why not? There's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You should have seen it erect.
No.
Ignore it.
Hide him.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
You're such a good friend.
Peter keeps asking me out.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I think I already have.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
No. I won't let you do that.
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Starving.
I'm not really hungry after all.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
That's great. Highly original.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
Uh huh. So pee.
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
No.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I'm working on it...
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
It's Mark.
This really isn't a good time.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
A little.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
It's stupid.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm sorry.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Briefs.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
My period? No.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
A man killed in Central Park.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What happened?
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
I love you too.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Worse than this?
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Oh my god, what happened?
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, take it.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
No, I have a cat.
How big?
Packages of money.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
Take some allergy medicine.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
And you think I'm sick?
And he was missing an arm.
We only live a few blocks apart.
The park dude was missing an arm.
This one walk you home too?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What makes her think that?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks. Just some pills.
Only two bucks. Shave as well...
What of?
The city. I need to get to the ocean.
Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On vacation?
Maybe ten minutes... Thats strange.
Spinning backwards?
Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor... I need the file on.. Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
His wife.
Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
No one available.
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir... I don't know exactly.
He tried to kill me!
Shut up! Everybody stay calm...
Just visiting my patient.
Really? And how is his state of mind?
He's seriously disturbed...
Yes, of course. Everything's fine...
That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Just like that?
I'm afraid so.
Yes. This way.
Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
A hunch. He might be able to...
Ill be the judge of that. Anything else?
I see...
Sorry, sir.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Patricia Crenshaw.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
You wont regret this, sir.
Fine.
Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
Wrong? Look at this!
<u>Fine</u>? Look here!
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Well be more careful, please.
Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
Put it through...
Yes, sir. <u>Everything</u>?
All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.
Shut-up.
Who?
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
What?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Not that. Anything else.
What? Who has?
No... No doctor...
What is that door?
Which one?
There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go?
No. Have a look.
Yes.
Where does it lead?
It must be a closet or something.
But I...
I see. The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak! Monster! You are insignificant.
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
No. I mean... that isnt necessary.
Shut up!
Please...
You know something about me?
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
Tell me about them...
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right. I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Well...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Maybe.
I have to go...
You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...
No, it's the truth.
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time? Is that it!
Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.
No it isn't. <u>You</u> are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and...
Nothing. I don't know anything!
I'm... being... punished.
We are... living in their dreams...
How do you know I'm innocent?
That's easy. You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Right.
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
The usual...
Don't worry. You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise. I won't.
Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
I mean, if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
No...
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
) Listen, you little...
Well it's a last minute change.
Great.
Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
I'm... not... nobody...
You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.
I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
I know.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
TilT we figure something out.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Soon.
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
I was a senator, you know.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
What about her.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke' story...
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
We've got nothing, Bob. This won't work.
Are you out of your mind?
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
It's a homeless shelter.
Oh. Excuse me.
It's gonna be great. 'Caring about his wife.' 'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
Oh. Fine.
I don't think so.
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
Bob...
I'll lock him away for good.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.
Dave -- I'm working.
Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh. Okay. I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
They could put you in jail.
Why would they do that. They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I am the government.
Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.
Choices?
Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
So what do we do?
Well -- take care.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Extend them. C'mere for a second.
Well, it's... It's sort of an... an `incident' really...
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Really? Crazy?
In the car.
I see what you mean.
What?
I don't think so.
Oh.
What?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Fine.
What?
Quick. Gimme a quarter.
We vetoed that?
Right. We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
Alan...
Absolutely. Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
She knows.
He's not.
Does it make the cars any better?
No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Oh... Thanks.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Fertility beads.
Ah.
Certainly.
What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What?
You know. Your first campaign.
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
You're not?
No.
What?
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
Oh.
Yeah.
You got a gun?
Of course.
No.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
No... They don't kid.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.
The Vice-President...
Oh... right... You know, ever since the stroke...
Well...
No thanks. It's not that far.
Thanks, Duane.
Uh...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I'm outta here.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Yeah. I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
You made their funding disappear!
I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
No.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh, I don't think so. Still, you helped a lot of people.
You weren't in the state legislature.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
Home.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
You1re leaving, too?
I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.
I don't know. I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
I don't mind.
Thanks.
Oh... Okay.
It's just so strange...
What?
I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.
Just wait.
You have a lot of secrets.
I guess.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yes.
I run a temp agency.
You find people jobs?
Yeah. Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
But you could go to jail for it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
That's okay.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
What?
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change. You like it?
It's nice.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Oh... I lived with a President. It isn't any fun.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
It better be. Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.
Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on?
All set.
Fabulous.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Leave him.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Look.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Come on.
The tunnel.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Gasparilla?
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
Curse?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
That sounds like a curse to me.
What?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
The hospital?
We got a boat.
What?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
What?
Come on. Let's go.
What you wanna do?
Come on!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
You are dying, too.
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
It's because of me.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Sir!
No, sir.
Let me see your weapon.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
To fucking Mutt.
Will do.
Don't come.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
So don't goddam come! Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox?
I don't think they're in school.
They're townies?!
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse.
Terrible. Awful! I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
It will? How do you figure?
Women swoon!
But why?
Yeah.
Well?
So?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Yep.
I'll tell you later.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
And English, and trig
How about a trig study group? Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Ahh! Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
Garden?
Oh come on, Pitts...
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I couldn't stop myself.
So much the better.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Yes sir.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I'm sorry. I, we
I told you, that's a secret.
Isn't he precious?
I think you're sweet.
What?
Please! It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Doing fine, sir.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Good. We're very excited about him. He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Yes... sir.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan. I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah. Sure. Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
I'm in.
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.
No.
What happened?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
What good will that do?
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Are you kidding? Don't be ridiculous.
It's better than doing nothing.
It's not all right. Come on, Dad
Nice meeting you, Knox. Bye, Gin.
It does? What?
You know,
Stop what?
Chet...
Knox?!
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High. How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Sort of.
You going out for the Henley Hall play? They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
You are? She's glad I called!
No.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
But, Chris...
I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
Huh?
Knox! what are you doing here?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You can't be in here.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Of course just like that. That's how you always know when it's right.
Are you going with Chet?
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
My Word
It's just for a little while. You promised.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
That goes for all of you. Now eat with your correct hands.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
I didn't know you taught.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
Boys marching. Clapping in unison.
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
Again! Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
All right! Very good! There's a barbarian in there after all!
A madman. Perhaps he was. What kind of madman? Don't think! Answer.
A crazy madman.
Use your imagination! First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Excellent! Have him act. Give it rhythm!
I have something.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Nothing wrong with research.
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Yeah.
You have another choice.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
I don't know.
What I have to do. Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
I'm calling her!
Nothing. No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
Good luck.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Yes sir.
Good boy. Call us if you need anything.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Father, I--
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
That's miles.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, your grades hurting too?
What is it?
The god of the cave.
Todd Anderson.
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I don't.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Nothing.
Thanks but I'd better do history.
I... I just don't want to come.
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading. I don't want to do it.
Found what?
What I want to do! Right now. What is really inside of me.
A play, dummy.
I know that. What's it got to do with you?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit. Nothing's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first? Maybe he'll say yes.
That's a laugh. If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
I guess.
No? What do you mean 'no'?
No.
Sssh. That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
From you?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet. I have to think.
It's my birthday.
It is? Happy Birthday. You get anything?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..
Oh.
what?
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground. God, I love this!
This play?
Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit. Where were we?
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
That's it! "Follow my voice. We'll try no manhood here." See you at dinner.
Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know.
Yes.
How do we get out of here?
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
And where is our point of arrival?
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
I have a schedule...
You're going to have to get a new one.
Not an option.
Then you better start swimming.
Dead.
Shut up!
I told you...
With who?
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
Who asked you to!
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
What are you people talking about?
He's with them.
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Thank you, I work at it...
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Self sufficient...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Takes one to know one.
On the side!!
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
The quiet...
A meat locker.
We can't just leave them here.
You should talk...
What?
Yeah...
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
So?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Me??
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Joey...look at me...
I'm stuck...
I don't know...you got what we need?
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
That way.
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Seafood salad. You ever operate a jet ski?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I have been.
And what have you come up with?
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Joey...
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
A passenger...
Nowhere...
You want some too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Maybe plans changed...
Plans don't change...
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What is it man?
I'm looking...
Shut up!
John...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
I know...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Good... Pass the beer.
Get the boots.
I mean let's get going before --
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Fuckin' A!
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's going?
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
No women?
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
I'll get it! Where is it?
It is too! Now you passed it!
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
They did too!
Jesus, it's freezing!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Nick...? Jesus, Nick!
I know, but...
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Vince thinks... you know...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
You don't!
I do!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She does not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
It won't open.
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Here. Hit it here.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Jesus!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Married?
Tell him, Vince.
You mean...?
Worse since she talked to who?
Yeah.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
No.
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
You are frightened, no?
Ah yes. Of course. To the girl who waits.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Yeah.
You are his friend.
Where is he???
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Everybody love Linda.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
I show you. Come. You come. Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Linda, yeah.
You call me Linda, just like home.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
Too bad.
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Now he's back.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Who's got the ammo?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Inside, Vince.
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sit down. Here. Right here. Albert! Vince!
Rough. We didn't have to do it, John.
No?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
No?
Worse since she talked to him.
Talked to Sal? Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Sal's alive???
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Oh, Jesus.
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Biederman!
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Oh... You know...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
What?
Will you marry me?
Okay.
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
But --
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
I see you're going hunting.
I don't know.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing?
We... Three bullets.
And then you...
Who the hell knows!
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I want to go home, Merle.
Right here.
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
There's Vince!
Right.
I know.
That way it sets.
Yeah.
Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Yeah... I guess.
What do you think about?
Yeah. When it comes to hunting, that's true.
From Nam?
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
Oh.
Hell no!
Well, where's he from?
From Nam?
Yeah.
Promise! You gotta promise!
You got it.
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Hunt with Vince?
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
What are you, God?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal?
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun?
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
Three bullets -- minimum.
No way. No fucking way!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Sit down.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... Why?
You wanna bet?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
No!!!?
No.
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
There's Albert! Hey, Albert!!!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
Right.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Great. That's great.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
Listen, Nick --
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
What?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
You didn't get a deer?
Here. Behind you.
Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know?
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Phantom Mary?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
No.
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Aw, it's a long story!
That's who.
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
What's it for??
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Naw. Uh-huh.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No.
No!
Never one.
Oh, Jesus! You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
The fuck I did!!!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up.
Up ribbon!
Down.
Down ribbon!
Up.
Jesus. Sweet Jesus. We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
What did you say?
I'd think about it.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Avon Lady!
Who are you? What the fuck do you want?
No, you're not model material. Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Put that on your political resume.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea. You look like shit.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Later. I want Doucet first.
Fill it out. Standard issue mal- practice insurance. All Cops carry it.
I remember what he looks like. I can't forget.
He's not that old yet. You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Give it to me.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Out of the room.
I'll be alright.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
You can't win like this. You'll only get older. This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
Forget it. Stick to the program.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
What the hell are you talking about?
You want evidence. I'll give you evidence.
Telephone repairman.
How do I look?
Aces.
Keep 'em busy.
Shut up! Drop it.
I got it. I got it.
You sure? I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Nobody's looking.
Go in the house.
Not the 'T' word.
Ooops, I forgot.
Yes.
Well, that's good enough for me.
But Sergeant...
Give me a break, Sanchez. It's like riding a bike.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas...
Got it. Ejection seat?
Commissioner Gallagher said... ...twenty years is a long time.
Doucet killed my partner.
Technothugs.
How do you know?
Some things never change.
There's no time. There are civilians in there. It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure. We'll have to wait until they move.
Well, I'm sure. You're a cop. I'm a cop. Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
My insurance won't cover it.
Pass.
Yes.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Trust me. You don't want to know.
Relax, let technology do the work.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
How then?
I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...
I was set up.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago. Thought maybe he'd come back.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Thanks.
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
Good night.
Never use it. Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
I'm serious, Wade. This case is important to me.
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
Then find me some cigarettes.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up. You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
No, sir.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Simulated one.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>. Can't assimilate voice stress. Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
...What are you talking about...?
Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her.
...Have you been drinking?
Not yet.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it? Your legs? Hands?
Hospital food.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
No you don't.
And you should be with your family.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
Take a look at this.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
My granddad was a policeman.
What's your name?
William Simpson. I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.
Haven't seen you around. Where have you been all my life, handsome?
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Of course I will.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Belle --
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
I didn't.
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You know that you're in my house.
Well, I wouldn't mind. But my name's Daniel Stone.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
It hasn't opened yet?
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Young man -- you got me there.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
And serve him right!
Why? It don't hurt.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
No! No! I won't.
Daniel! ... I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
That's just too bad --
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure am.
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle.
Belle --
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
No, you're not.
Where's everybody?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven. No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Look here now--
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He was --
I'm through with you.
About what?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Yes -- at midnight.
Well, I --
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Dan'l Webster?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Why not -- ?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Shake!
Coming.
Oh, Jabez.
Yep.
Who is it?
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
Mary -- how do you feel?
Jabez!
Mary -- what would you do?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary. It's been a long day.
Tired?
Worried!
There is nothing to worry about now.
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
Oh -- Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'm serious.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Hello, Jabez -- Here's your son.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
I am going to lock him up.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
It shows on your face.
I don't know, Jabez.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Jabez!
Mary! Come back ...
All right, Jabez ...
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
All right, son -- if it helps.
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Me -- a son.
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Golly, Ma -- Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Sure, Ma.
Ma! ... Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
It's all right, Sheriff.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
I guess we won't.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
What's that?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
You aren't angry with me?
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
I won't forget.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
I'll be there, too!
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Me?
There, Mr. Webster. All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I want someone to talk to ...
You can talk to me ...
I can't be honest with them.
Argyle. I'm your limo driver. Hey, nice bag.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, you divorced of what?
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan. You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'll find someplace.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I'm in charge here.
Not any more.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
The police...?
John.
John? Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.
See to Heinrich... Now...you can break the code key...?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Who said we were terrorists?
Who are you, then?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Only if New Jersey counts.
I'm a cop from New York.
New York...
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
William Clay. Call me Bill.
Put it down now.
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'? Now you are fucked.
I told you...
We may have some problems. How is your schedule?
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
Gennero. Miss Gennero.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Don't I always?
Holly Gennero?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Can I get you anything? Food? Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Uh, what do I call you?
The plastique I found. Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
In my youth, partner. In my youth.
You don't want to know.
I...I shot a kid.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
Then this won't matter. LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.
Bullshit.
I'm serious. Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
A hunch. Things he said. Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What's it look like? We're going in.
Yessir.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson. Who is this?
No. I never smile any more.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
They jet's comin' out. But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Listen.
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
What about the kids?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, how'll I get home?
Take the subway. We need the car. Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
It's okay... it's okay...
He says he doesn't know. Why don't you cook whatever's there?
It looks like a whole roast.
The robbers in the bank. They got guns?
Yeah. A lot of guns.
Well, stay away from them. Don't get close.
Oh, yeah, I will...
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny? Don't send me away! I can help you save your soul ...
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way. I'll tell you.
Well.... huh ...
Ooohh....
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah. It was terrible.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah. So how are you?
Fine, thank you. I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Yeah... I know.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know. Boy... I'm dying.
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
I know that. I'm warped... I'm warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Denmark? Sweden?
I like that... yeah!
Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow! Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am. I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
What?
Oh... they're fucken crazy. That's a snow job. Don't listen to that shit!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Shit...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right. Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Yeah.
You don't have a choice?
No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... who's on the phone?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... yeah!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
Right. See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Yeah... I'll write a song. Ha, ha. I don't know. Life is funny!
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
I don't know what to say to him. I can't.
You think it over, Leon.
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away. I don't know what we do now.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal? What's that for? Salvatore?
What do you want to know that for?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Sonny-boy, one word?
One word. You won't find it in the phone book.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.
You frisk me.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Come on. I want you to see something.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
I want to see my wife. I want you to bring her down here.
What do you want?
The girl hostages.
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Cokes, seven-ups ... also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it. Charlie! Six pizzas!
Okay ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
I want to talk to him.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He's totally unstable. He'll make a mistake.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
Okay, don't worry about it. Stick it in the bag...
My side, shit!
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Give me the keys...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I took too long.
It's locked on the inside. It's through that passageway and to the right.
Mulvaney...
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
If you take anybody, please take me.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
I don't know.
Oh, Jesus! You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
They look like good kids.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
No you don't.
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
We like you, too.
Yeah.
Why not?
I don't think so.
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No. I had some legal training, but...
I want to dictate my will. I need a notary?
What now, Sonny?
Everything's all right? You okay?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah. Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Okay.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Howard!
What about Howard?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
Hey. It's raining.
It was on the TV.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped? Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
Pure?
You shouldn't start now.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You're serious!
Yes...
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
What are you crying for? Jesus Christ. It's not your fault there's no money...
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Get 'em in the vault!
Ah shit. Okay... go ahead. Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
What?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
But do you mean it?
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
Dead or alive?
Alive.
All right ... send them the guard.
All right ... let's go.
What kind of a deal?
Does that still go?
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Everybody! Back here!
Have him walk in backwards.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
All right.
I'm here.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want to talk to Leon.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What I said. You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
It's my mother. Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
Gimme the black guy...
You follow my car.
Okay. Which one goes?
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
I am.
Open this up!
I speak what I feel.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
It's not a joke. I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Who the hell is that? God damn it! What the...
I forgot she's in here.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
He's got diabetes. He's not a well person.
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza! Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
They're beautiful ...
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey. Wish us luck!
I said you were never a faggot.
We can't stay here.
What'll you do? Come out.
I can't, Mom. If I come out Sal will kill them.
Oh. Run.
What the hell for? Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...
Maybe! Aw Christ, what dreams you live on! Maybe what?
Did Pop come down?
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you. I'm askin' you a question ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Newsman, not ...
Oh yeah? Give up? You ever been in prison?
Of course not ...
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<i>$300,000.</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
What do you think, dumbshit?
What?
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Yes.
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
What!!?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
What?
Yep.
<i>Deliver them to the Needles DMV. Sundown at the Sam Kinison monument.</i>
I don't know.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
PROVE IT!
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt.
I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
I was a musician.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question... Which one of you is Frances?
There are no bond certificates.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
Something is going down. Something bad.
He said... take his right arm.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Do you know where Danang is?
Not really.
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Twice a night, sometimes.
Okay. Domino Harvey is here.
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
In theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
She went up to her room.
Real good.
Nobody.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
Real fast.
I be. I'm living large.
Is that the only tape you got?
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I don't like anything else.
Check this out. Y'know Sal's.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
You got my back.
My brother.
My brother.
Yes?
You almost knocked me down. The word is "excuse me."
Excuse me. I'm very sorry.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So?
Have you noticed something about them?
And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Did you ask Sal?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Jade, I still love you.
Two dollars! Forget it!
Boycott Sal's. Boycott Sal's.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What da fuck! Are you deaf?
No, are you? We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
What?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
You the man.
No, you the man.
We're not hanging out. I'm being escorted back to work.
What was you saying?
OK, but listen up. I'm gonna break it down.
No!
I don't know how he does it.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I'm not stopping. I'm on my way.
You're welcome.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed. You almost got yourself killed last night.
I've done that before.
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
We're still standing.
Gotta go.
C'mere, Doctor.
OK. OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
That's it.
How old are you?
Ten.
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie.
What makes Sammy run?
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
You got a deal.
Wake up!
Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
It's gonna be hot today.
Do me a favor. Go to work.
Later. Gotta get paid.
I'm in here.
I'm working.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Later for Sal. Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
What responsibilities?
I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm coming.
I'm going with you.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see ya there.
See ya around.
Stop tripping.
No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips.
What are you so worked up about?
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
Innocent!
I didn't stutter. You heard me.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now. Where's the stuff?
Yeah, me too.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Sorry, comb got caught.
Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an old woman.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I'll do.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Don't like 'em. A fan will do.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
C Duracell.
D! D! D! You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first. D.
Twenty! Motherfucker! Twenty!
Motherfucker you.
That's right on time. This is my friend, Vito. His pops is Sal.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
Fuck! My money!
You're raggedy as a roach. You eat the holes out of donuts.
I'll be back on my feet. Soon enough.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
Look at that.
What is?
That's my name.
Do I have to spell it out?
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
It's a motherfucking shame.
What?
ML, hold this for me.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Yes you did.
Naw, that's some stupid shit. Now you know how I got that name.
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Him no white. Him no white.
Who doesn't work? Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Talk to your son.
I got no say over people.
Run it then.
Big deal? If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Depends.
Can you pay me now?
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight. We're still open.
I would like to get paid now.
Tonight, when we close.
Here, you gotta delivery.
No, just checking.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money. I wants to get paid.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Quit bullshitting.
You don't know shit about shit.
My salary. Two-fifty.
You only pay me two-fifty a week. I owe you fifty bucks.
Keep it.
You keep it.
Christmas came early.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No. What are you gonna do?
Make dat money. Get paid.
Mookie?
Gotta go.
C'mere, Doctor.
OK. OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
I work too, but I still make time.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
When?
Before I get off work.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me?
Do I love you?
What took you so long? Is it hot?
Hot. Hot.
Come in then.
Where's the ice cream? The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit! I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
I just forgot.
I can run out and get it.
No! No! You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son?
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
No rawness.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda. Meda.
What?
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Yes, yes, Lord. Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
To get my money.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.
I am a man.
Later.
You're to the curb. You better step off. Get a life.
Hello, Sal. Hello, Vito.
You're still late.
Fuck dat shit. I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You get paid to do what we say.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
What?
Remember what I said.
Gotta go. See ya soon. Everybody happy now?
Magic Johnson.
And not Larry Bird? Who's your favorite movie star?
Eddie Murphy.
Keep dreaming.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
Ya like him, huh?
Yeah.
That's what I think.
I don't like to fight.
We're outta here.
He's right.
It's Prince. He's a Prince freak.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
On the rebound.
HATE!
I love you, my brother.
I love you, Black.
I ain't getting shit.
Sez who?
Sez me.
Forget it, Mookie.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good. I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls. I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
I know.
You really think so?
I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted.
So what do you want me to do?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway. I hate this freakin' place.
Can you do better? C'mere.
Here, take the broom. The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so stupid?
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
'Bout time, Pop.
Shaddup! Jade, what can I fix you?
Be right there, Pop. Listen to what I said.
Tell Pino.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Whaddup?
Tell 'em, Pop.
Don't start on me today.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Actually we have something for you.
Yeah, I think.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
I'll tell you why!
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
You did?
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
I'm fine.
Just down the hall.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What?
Coming.
Okay, what?
What? No! Look.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I don't follow.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
I know I am, Mom.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Right.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
So boys, how was your first day?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep. HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.
No, that's not it. Anyway - LLOYD Christmas.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Me too!
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
You're it.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Me too!
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Yeah, he's aces. Thanks, Turk!
Shift to your left.
The principal.
Wow.
Oh, is this your special place?
The second R is silent.
Oh, of course.
You brave soldier.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Go fish.
Who's Captain Rob?
Just a guy I hang out with.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
What?
Your mom made a move on me.
She did not.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Kids.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Don't look directly at him.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
And he invented fire.
They can't be real.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Put some ice on it.
And my mouph is frozen.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Wanna bet?
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Some what?
Sure I do. On one condition.
You can't marry my mom.
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
You're always your harshest critic.
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
So, have you given him "some" yet?
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A blimp.
A turd.
Who?
Hello, he only invented money!
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
Sorry, no further questions.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
No. Look.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Do you know what this means?
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
Roger that, Wilco.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
And with that complete loser
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Okay. Which one do you want?
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Hey, where'd you go?
That's gross.
I know.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce. Well, I see you have a camera.
No.
Oh, you're good.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Oh I think you do.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Not to expect you tonight.
That's not your tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
TURK, leave him alone. You're coming too.
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
You're just jealous.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Looks like the best man won.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
Can you believe it?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What are you talking about?
Skateboard.
Of course it does. Obviously in denial. Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Okay.
Do we have a deal?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Uh-oh. Harry?
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
I liked it a lot.
Hey can be on top?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
It's too close to call. Okay next contest, now lets...
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
I reckon so.
No.
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Yes you are.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
And I you.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Yes!
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything?
Everything. Just for the record.
Just like the President.
What papers?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The evidence of what?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Piter.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
This is my son, Paul.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
With your permission...
Nothing.
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Yes.
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Sire!
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not sorry enough.
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Paul!! Paul!!
Don't you trust your own eyes.
They said you were dead. They said...
My Lord?
Let him stand free!
The Emperor's blade.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
As the legend says.
It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
What does she fear? What about my Father?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Excellent!
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock...
Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
He knows.
I can't... I can't.
Yes...
I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone.
Yes...
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
That it is. He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always?
Always.
Why do they come?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch!
We call that one Muad'dib.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
They tried and died.... Jessica!
What can be done has been done.
MOTHER! Tell me!
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
SILENCE!
Those sounds could be imitated.
I'd know the difference.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
We have our new army. Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Greetings. I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
It is my home.
"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Uh, Greetings. I am the Count...
Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this! <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
No.
YES! My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No. I don't work here.
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Really?
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Don't you bave a car?
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.
Don't worry. I do it every Halloween.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Yeah. You pull the strings -- "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Huh?! Oh yeah, of course.
But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?
Of course!
We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
They do? Shoot. There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital. Just take me to the couch...
Nah. This happens all the time...
Goulash.
I don't know how to make goulash.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Beg to differ. This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
I never said I could ad-lib...
Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Mmph? Where am I?
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
"Dear, you're lovely." "Strap her to the table."
Stop worrying. This is going to raise your spirits.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
Yeah, I did.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out <u>there</u>?! What happened to the stream?
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Fuck you! <u>You</u> come out here. Hey, toss me that J.D.
Huh?
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.
No, you look good. And the tests came back fine. C'mon...
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Oh. So what is the scene about?
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
No problem. I know it by heart...
I don't know. Where?
Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
I dunno. Lie on the beach?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
If you say so.
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What's to protect? It was perfect!
Rolling.
Sound!
What do you mean?
This is the big moment...!
Nothin'! I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
This is kind of a stream--
NO! It has to be UNDERWATER!
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell. I know all.
I don't understand.
I made it up. It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
My pleasure. I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
We'll do our best.
Isn't he?
No. They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
What?
The ghost can be barefoot. <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane." I'm already 30!
You got the job?!!
Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Better than not getting a job?
Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Who? Robert Taylor?!
No! A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Close! The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
I thought he was dead.
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
So did you get his autograph?
This is my way of telling you --
Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
Oh, just like in the script!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Say it a little louder. I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Exactly.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
The secretary. Or the file clerk.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
I'm going to my mother's.
Does she have room for me?
Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
That's right...
Oh really? How much money did he put up?
None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions. The mark of quality.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
Yes. Hollywood is oh so exciting.
That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Yeah. Exactly!
What other sixty-thousand?
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
You misunderstood. I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
That's not true --
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
It's Wood. Ed Wood.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show. I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics. It opens next week.
Screen Classics? Hmm, don't know them.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got?
Hruphh...?
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
You could say that --
Absolutely! You see this script..?
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
<u>Lugosi</u>??! Didn't be pass on?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk. Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
People won't notice. Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, of course!
Tor!
Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter! It's a visual medium.
Hopefully, very soon. I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Nonsense! You must try our hot glug.
Don't worry. We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Yes?
Oh. Um, I'm Ed Wood! So, what are you working on now?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood. I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Fuck no! But there's a poster.
No. Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
No! It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>. The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Who?
Yeah! <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Uh, yeah. Our picture.
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
There's still a sex-change --
And what's with this new title?! My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Yeah? Whatever. So did you like it?
Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh. Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
Oh. My condolences.
Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
How long's he been here?
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am. How's your father?
He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
Not good...
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice. Let me get my coat.
What do you mean?
"Dracula."
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh. Okay.
Okay?
STOP!
Bela died.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Dynamite --
No, BIGGER! What's the biggest energy??
The sun.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yeah... I should give her a call.
Who's Dr. Tom?
My chiropractor!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
C'mon! Let's just go.
Let's get married.
Huh?!
<u>Right now</u>. Let's drive to Vegas!
But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
Yes?
No. I think my film is perfect for you.
It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
Well it looks good. Let's use it!
Here's to Ed. For making us into something.
Yeah...?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES! JUST DO IT!
What octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
Great! Bring 'em in! Bunny, I gotta run.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Are you IN5ANE? <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
I thought this was a group effort.
NOOOOO!!!
I'm directing.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose. It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
No you're not! This marriage was never consummated. I'm getting an annulment!
Who?
Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Oh. Yeah. You.
ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Come on...
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Who?
They celebrated the common person.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
No.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
Yes!
What?!
What?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
Okay, I'm nuts.
So?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
What?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
You know it.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Excuse me.
I want you to take this.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
A woman wants to be pursued.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
This guy.
Good luck.
Yes?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Mm... Oh, man...
I ... don't know. I ...
Who?
Al!
No. The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
You said that.
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Your brother's here.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
No! Don't -- Oh, wow.
What?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby... Jessica!
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
So he killed himself.
Oh.
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Hey, he cheated on her.
He made a mistake.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Mm.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.
Holy sh--
He says --
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Who?
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
What's the matter?!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him? With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
But Al is your husband now!
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
I'm a tramp Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Shari, Ray feels --
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
Well, when will she be back?
What are you talking about?
She wouldn't tell me.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Our what?
Our foibles, our foibles!
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Welcome to work, Ed.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Dynamite.
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Dynamite is dangerous.
Right.
Okay ...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh... how come?
Yeah.
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
Go!
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Oh God, this is so weird.
I missed you.
Yeah, well...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh yeah.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Saturday, I think we should
Why?
He could give me some oxygen.
What?
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ... ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Ohh...
Really?
Ed?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Somewhere.
Come on...
Are you all right?
No. It's your fault.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
The what?
Come on.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
Where were you?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
Hi, Shari. Let's go in the stockroom.
What?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Why do you do that?
What?
I'm doing all right.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
I don't know.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Hey. Check this out. Look at this.
No. What happened?
That's our sister. She's got a new boyfriend.
No, this is great. You'll love this. He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Oh, Jesus.
What's the dif --
Richie! She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah...
We'd better go...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Please!
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Cassie...
Ray, come an--
Me?!
Who's Shari?
Who's --
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
What...
The pirate ship.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
What?... Why?
Hi.
Thanks... That's ...
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh... I'd better get a cab.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Hm?
No.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
What is? Oh, dinner!
Good?
Mm.
Ed?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Yeah. Why?
How?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
pierde.
She's incredible. Everything just gets soaked.
I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals.
What kind of person?
Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Yeah, just --
Do it!
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
You guys have fun?
What?
Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes.
What?
Dick.
So nice
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
All right. I'll be back
Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Yeah?
I think we've got a problem.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
I know.
Tracy.
Ethics are...
Oh. There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Here they are.
You can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
NO, that's fine
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Okay, fine. Sure
You bet.
Should be easy. So far no competition.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Looks like today's your lucky day
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Hello, Tracy.
I'm looking at new cars.
Oh. New cars. I see. Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you. Good for you
Sporty.
Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
That sounds good.
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
I've got an idea.
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Take as much room as you want
You'll be fine.
I hope so
You will.
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.
Even tried you at home. We've got a situation here.
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Oh. Okay.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Okay. But is this about the posters?
Possibly. Please just wait outside.
Okay. Because I know who did it. So.. I'll just be outside.
I'm the one. I did it. I tore down Paul's posters.
Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a word.
I did it.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday. Sunday.
And how did you get in the school?
Door was open.
Which door?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I don't believe you.
I have proof.
Sure.
Here?
More this way.
Okay. Give me the drill.
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Oh.
Dave.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life. He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
We'll let it run awhile
Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.
Right now?
Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
Yeah. I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that. You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake. Let's not make it worse.
A mistake? That was no mistake.
I was lonely. You took advantage
Yeah.
And she's super-nice
Huh? Oh. Uh... pears
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Okay, let's say
No, wait -- apples. Apples.
If you say so.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Larry, you just take it easy
I'm not like you.
What...?
What?
People can see this.
So?
These are private -- these are for us.
I know.
But other people can see them too.
I don't care.
Well, I do.
Sorry.
It's a conflict of interest. And Paul was first.
For what?
I mean at you.
For what?
I don't know. You're her brother you should know.
It was Tammy I That's who it was.
Oh, no, hey. Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Huh? Oh, hi, Tracy
What do you mean?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
No. Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Thought what?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Thanks!
Yeah.
Sure, Tracy.
Oh, yeah, sure. Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Have a great summer. And good luck at college.
Thanks. You too. It was great working with you.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah. So guess what happened. So Mr. McAllister, he -- Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What'd I do?
Okay. Great. I feel good.
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom. I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
It's not what you think.
Yeah, plain scotch.
Of course I am. What kind of question is that?
No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yes. But do you know?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I don't know.
It's Bud.
Yeah. But not for long.
He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
We talked.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
No. Now. You fucked him.
This business, Captain?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Doing what? Mowing your fucking lawn?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
How'd you get them to retract?
You've got it, Wendell.
Seen him around. He used to be a cop.
I got to write my report first.
What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Five minutes. That's all.
Maybe. I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?
No! Please leave!
Yeah. A great big one.
It's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you, White?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Get the fuck away from me.
It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. <u>Justice</u>.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
She told you?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
What?
Which one are you and which one am I?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
At least not anymore.
What about him?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Me? You called it. I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
I'm not asking you.
I don't know him. Mr...
Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here. How did you find me?
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
Against your code?
No.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
That's right.
Wait. Our deal still holds?
What little studio?
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett.
His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.
More's gonna cost you.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Exactly. At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
What do you mean?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
And I'll promote you. You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
More or less.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Someone must've pulled the records.
I don't have time. I have --
Just show me where they are!
Say what and so what.
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
Believed what?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh? you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Say what?
They shot him in his library.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Gone. Not a trace.
I'm happy to cooperate. You don't need to tie me down.
What does that have to do --
And what?
He runs call girls. Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
So be it.
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Yes, I do, sir.
It's mine. I'll make you my second in command.
I'll break them, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Anonymous. Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland.
Why not, lad? Absolute justice?
Something like that.
Okay. I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley. It's important.
It's a private investigation. I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
No.
Not even with Exley?
That's right.
I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert. I'm just doing my duty.
<u>Shit</u>. Someone beat us here.
What?
Glasses.
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Yeah. My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant. I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
It's a simple question.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I want to do it right.
A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Great. You get the girl, I get the coroner.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea. You got a description?
Of his penis, sir?
Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.
Not good enough.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Really? What did White say?
Why?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
I know how he feels.
Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
When?
Right now, before I back down.
Where is he?
Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
None. Call it a hunch.
The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it.
What's Dudley's scheme?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
All he found were rodents. No signs of foul play. So there.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
No. It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, are you back on Narco? I need copy.
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis? Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Around.
Sid, cut the crap. I --
What's wrong, Trash?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
I just called it.
No, Sergeant. I checked twice.
A bootleg...
Yeah.
Something like that.
Oh, I know. A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars. Pierce Patchett has it all.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Really? How?
It'll be our secret.
Showbiz.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap. Back in Narcotics.
Oh? Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Oh Jesus.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
I don't know what that means.
Listen to me--
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Listen--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Do it!
Clear as day.
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
Be careful, Danny.
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Rachel Banks?
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Told by whom?
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Who are they?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
Wait.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Yeah.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that means.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They're spooks.
I don't know what that--
No shit.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if--
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
I'll pay you.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
Move it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
We said a hundred.
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
I told you no calls.
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
It really is. Did you find anything?
Yeah. Take a walk with me.
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Oh my God...
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
Goddammit--
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
No.
Who?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
C'mon.
Not particularly, no.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
Oh my God.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With what?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Neil, thank you for your help.
Anytime.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married.
That's fine.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
Very good.
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight. Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
For that matter, I think you will too.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Why?
Because my life is being ruined.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Thanks. Who are you?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Your stuff?
The robbery.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
A report?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About the accident.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Uh-oh.
Listen to him.
Not a very good one, but--
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
You should take this seriously.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
What?
I saw a man die.
What do you mean?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Yeah.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Have you been working with Rachel?
No.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Well, you know--
He's got his priorities?
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
How could you let me find out like this?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
Robert--
It's not true.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I know.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Leave this house.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I know, but listen--
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Yes.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Well...yeah.
Good.
Stacy--
That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
You opened the thing?
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
Yeah.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Yeah. I wish you could've met...
Who?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
You did good.
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
My suitcase is gone.
Don't count on it.
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That ain't me.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Oh.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
Not that much.
DePinto?
Brill.
Never.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
What answer were you--
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
So you've said.
Other than me.
Why would I--
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You're not.
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
Eat your fish.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
Why?
You got a minute?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Who's doing this?
I gotta go.
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
I <u>did</u> care how.
This conversation's over.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.
You're Brill.
Brill.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
You're firing me.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Bobby--
Fuck off.
Good point.
I don't under--
Mr. Dean--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Where's Stacy?
She doesn't want to talk to you.
What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.
Why?
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
You staying for dinner?
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Alright!
No "900" numbers.
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
Serve the ball.
Table 122?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Just be cool.
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
So do I!
No. No, it's okay.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
What does that have to do with you?
I honestly don't know.
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
I said fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Who?
Get it.
Hiding something?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Help from whom? Christ.
He's clever? He had help? Oh.
Sir--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We don't know.
Explain that.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
And if it wasn't?
Do you have visual?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Hello! Good morning.
They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
As the wife of one of our party.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
He said - be careful.
Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who?
Her or me?
Pardon?
You sing. All the time.
I do not.
Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Look over there.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
No.
Shall we be all right?
Yes. Absolutely.
Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
Oh my God, the others!
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No, but I think I do.
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
I believe you still have my book.
Good.
You sew very badly.
You don't sew at all!
Now.
When were you least happy?
Now.
Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
A lie. What do you hate most?
Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
What? No!
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
No.
I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
This is empty, just coming!
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you.
It's a folk song.
Arabic?
No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
It's beautiful. What's it about?
You bastard, I was believing you!
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
What?
Dance with me.
No.
I can't move. I can't get out.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Don't leave me!
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Yes. Absolutely.
Oh dear.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I know.
Still a car.
There you have me.
You too. Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Appropriate?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
I haven't, no. Sorry.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
I see.
What?
If I could just see some identification.
Her hands and feet were tied.
What did you do?
In my room.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you.
Okay.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Thank you.
No.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
I don't know.
A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great.
Don't cut me.
Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me. Come on.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ.
Are you Hana?
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
No.
Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'll have some of your water. It's hot.
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
What? How could he have? When?
Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Please don't creep around this house.
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?
What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I can get in the back.
Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
For?
Top Hat.
Is there a song you don't know?
I've had a drink. Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Very true!
What?
The rest meant nothing to me.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
No, now I can't kill you.
Oh really?
Well, she is!
I'm fine. I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
Right.
Aren't you?
Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you. What do you smell of?
What?
Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Oh no, really. She has her book.
I won't hear of it. None of us will.
Very much so. We are all, save my friend here.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Candaules you're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
Yes. Dropping off.
How? How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.
Why? Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
Thank you. Thank you.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
Really? That's sudden.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
Why? Is he staying?
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
Kip's another one.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I don't think it's indifference.
Hey! -
- to her cooking.
You'd better be.
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
No!
Hana, I know you do!
I love you.
I don't think so.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
I've done this. I've had to do this.
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
Yes. Later.
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course. When?
I mean home. India.
Kip I -
It's what I've learned.
Then come with me.
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.
When he dies I'll catch up.
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
No. He's - no.
Oh God. Oh God.
Hello miss.
I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.
He's sleeping.
Only we have to go to work.
I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Does he have to go?
Pardon me?
What if you couldn't find him ? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I'm feeling old.
Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.
Go away.
Yessir.
This is making me incredibly angry.
How awful. What will you do?
Why not?
I don't think so.
I'll come with you.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What's he saying?
No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Or my wife's.
Then you were married?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
I don't recall asking your permission.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
You got a better idea?
Yeah. Me.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Which you have in mind.
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where are you at least?
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm in the middle.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
He's on to something bigger.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Too late now.
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please.
I don't want to waste your time.
Then don't.
I have a proposal for you.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I'll call an ambulance.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Excuse me?
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So what?
So alive.
You...you can't.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
No. Why would I be?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Not interested.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
It's not for sale.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Oh?
Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
Give him the card.
But--
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
You what--?
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
In a week.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
That's because I wanted them to!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
It was perfect.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
We are...for the tools.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
Hmmm.
It was a long time ago.
Yes you did.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
A dozen times.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
One more item--not on the check list.
It's---beautiful.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
I've got something for you.
Little celebration before we set off.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Aren't we all.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Something like that.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You can't be too careful.
Yes, you can. You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready.
Got it.
Behind you.
Duh.
Shut up.
The Mask.
What?
Yes. Yes.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay, 80-20--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Everything.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Parachute.
Packed.
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
There is one more thing.
Call it a new tradition.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
FUCKING THING!!!
The disc is still in there.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
I sincerely hope not.
You can do it.
No way.
Go!
Get out of here!
No, you can't.
I'm not leaving without you.
But--
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You mean the seven billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Always in a rush.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Which is--
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
And you do it so well.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
The key to success is using the right tools.
It's never big enough.
Because I never assume anything.
Black of course.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
You look like George Washington.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.
You damn well thought wrong.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
To yourself, that's where.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
Thought you had to use some of these.
I figured that out.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Yes it does.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Don't use language with me --
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
His dry cleaners. You want him?
What do you think? What's this?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
He's a low-life. Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
Right. Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
Who?
All of 'em?
All of them.
Which one?
There's more than one?
Yeah. There's two. Why?
What's your point?
So you say.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Jesus.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
You're a lawyer?
Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
They did?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yeah.
For what?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Both.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
Yup.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Bullshit, you don't.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
Good.
Excuse me?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Oh, yeah?
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>. Jesus.
Lemme see it, will you?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
What, you think I'm made of money?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Bullshit.
Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
You think there's more?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
She lived on the plume. You never know.
<u>No</u>.
It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.
No --
Show me the document that proves that.
Really? It makes me sick.
I would now.
Well, good, Ed. I like working with you too.
They're trying to intimidate us. Tell them to wait in the conference room.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
What? Who?
I don't know. Big. Dark.
He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine.
I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Not in my world.
Gee, I wonder why.
Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look. It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
No one's taking anything --
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.
When? Where?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the doctor says --
This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come.
Why not?
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Erin --
Erin? What are you --
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
I did. Both.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Take it.
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Corey.
Good.
Right.
I think we should makes some changes.
Nope. And I didn't ask.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
That's right.
What do you mean?
Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
Ross.
Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I guess I did.
Nope. Maiden.
You're married.
Not anymore.
There's more than one kind?
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh. What's that?
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
I don't know.
George!
So did I.
Some meeting. With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Yup. They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
In the conference --
Well I hate it.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
We'll see.
When?
I'm gonna go live with George.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Whose number do you need?
Everyone's. This is a lawsuit. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
You got more than one?
Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Return 'em. Maybe you'll get your money back.
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
Right.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Better safe than sorry.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
What do you mean?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm gonna clean it up.
No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me.
Nothing.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go. Take her, will you?
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin. Bullshit.
Thinking.
About what?
What's that?
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Mm-hm.
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
You know me. I pick things up real fast.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better. A lot of these folks aren't.
Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute. Get a little more sleep.
I will. Bye.
That's okay. I understand.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
What's going on?
Yes. It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Have you been logging on?
What?
Yeah. Who are you?
What?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Wow, that's soon --
Yes?
Who's Baxter?
He did, didn't he? <u>Baxter</u>!
The Emperor?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've discussed this before.
He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You are the last Jedi, Luke. You are our only hope. Be patient.
No ... there is another.
You must. Luke, look at me!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate.
I can help them!
You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
I feel The Force.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Right.
Everyone's invited, of course.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Okay, okay.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
No, I'm alright. I'm alright.
What happened?
Barks his agreement.
Barks his right on!
Howls.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Barks his agreement.
Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.
Looking? Looking? You've found someone I'd say. Heh? Yes!
Yeah ...
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
A great warrior? Not many on those. Wars don't make one great.
Mine! Mine! Or I'll help you not.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
You know the Jedi Master?
Patience. It's time to eat.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
Yes ... yes. That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Fine. But they'll have to take care of themselves.
What is it?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
The energy shield is down. We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
It can wait.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
I'm going to see what it is.
Not collapsing, honey. It's closing! This is no cave ...
Good. Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Does Luke know?
We?
Yes.
Not you?
Me? I don't know what you mean.
You probably don't. How could you? You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
No kidding. If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
Now don't panic. We don't know that.
Ooops! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Or you ran into something ....
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
I take it back.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Good.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
What is it?
That should do nicely.
Very funny. You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me. But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Yes, you do.
That's quite a compliment.
Why?
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
Try and control this ...
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
It's not my fault. I can't under- stand it!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas?
That depends. Where are we?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian.
Never heard of that system.
No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Let er go, Chewie.
It'll be all right. Trust me. And keep your eyes open. You wait here.
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Luke! I'm sure he's fine. Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Something's wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I'm worried about all of us. I can't figure out what they're up to.
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Thanks to you.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Don't worry. You haven't seen the last of us.
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'll bet.
Repairs ...
What have you done to my ship?
I'm sorry too.
Luke? I don't get it.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
No.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
I'm altering the bargain. Pray I don't alter it any further.
Not really.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
... we're the bait.
We have no use for your kind.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Sure I did ... once. It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Luke needs help. We must go back.
Wait a minute. We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
That sounds familiar.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Not yet. They're working on it now.
What is it?
We have no choice. Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I'll be back later.
Closer?!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
Let's go.
What did you say?!
I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...
That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off?
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Jabba the Hutt?
Luke, no! It's a trap.
He'll survive.
I've never seen it fail.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
You are reckless!
You will be, my young one. Heh. You will be.
I thought I was in good shape.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I? Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
No. Try not. Do, do. Or do not. There is no try.
That is why you fail.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
That they are.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
But I feel The Force flowing!
No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death. Something's not right.
Only what you take with you.
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast.
I see a city in the clouds.
It is the future you see.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
If it must be. Yes.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
And I too.
That won't be necessary.
Time will tell.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
Good God.
They suggested oranges.
They're...pretending to dress.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing. Where'd they get those clothes?
We know that.
My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
And we can watch ...
A display of primitive apparatus --
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
No -- clothes. Stevie, they changed into them.
I don't believe it.
Security. Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
They look pretty docile.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
He's a gorilla.
Humans?
I'm a psychiatrist.
Please
I like you.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Go on now. Do as I say.
He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Give it.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Where?
What?
It's so good to see you again.
Where's Plissken?
He's... near.
You're stalling, Eddie. Talk, you little gringo!
Cuervo, look out behind you!
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
What's in it for me?
Not anymore.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Somebody get off!
What's the little black box do?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Having second thoughts?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Call me Snake.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
No.
Good.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's history. I gotta go.
Yeah, I got it.
So where's Plissken?
Does he know how to activate it?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
No way.
I said pull over.
Right over there.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
Later.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
We'll see.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Don't like it, don't come.
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
If he lets you get close enough.
Looking to get out.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Which way?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Where?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
You need help.
Like hell I do.
The what?
Sewers. Come on.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Who?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
You're running out of time.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Yeah.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
...I saw nothing.
I will not.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
It is deep...
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Of Merlin?
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
In the great book.
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
What's this, what's this?!
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
...to ride out and meet them.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is it my child?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
What is this place, Merlin?
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well hurry then, and get it.
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
Ye...
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Without Lancelot?!
You, my lord.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
No.
Why?
There is one.
Who?!
You.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
To me? But why?
Love demands it.
--Nothing!
He has given up.
We are to blame.
You're a man?! ...with metal skin!
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
Can it truly be used for magic?
I'm not jealous!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Maybe... maybe...
Why?
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I swear it.
I?
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Well what's wrong?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Hiding?
Fuck it.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Yes.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
I'm sorry.
In here!
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
What's this?
Dinner at the White House.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.
No kidding.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Why don't you let me?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
What's Burke got to do with it?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
Of course I didn't.
What is it?
Phonograph.
Storage.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
Please.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
I just heard them Karl.
Yes, I go now.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl!!
She is going to be well?
What!
A man to see you.
What man?
No thanks Karl.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
It affects concentration.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Lies?
Never.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
Why, I don't understand?
To begin with it could make things worse.
But how?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
Please.
What do you drink?
Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
No
Well I think you should.
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
What?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
Father?
No.
Um........Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
We'll see Regan. Now about those party invitations.......
You like it?
Oh it's so funny.
I found it.
Where?
The closet
Yeah.
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
He's nice.
Oh I bet he is.
Here I'll show you.
You think?
Cause I like it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
I wouldn't talk.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Oh I love you.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
Well you know it's okay.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh, honey.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Honey it's to help you.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Hi Father.
Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
That's good.
Okay.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
I believe you.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Stealing is a sin.
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
Sure.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
No.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I'm not Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Where's Regan?
In here. With us.
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Uh Huh.
In time.
No now.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Holy water.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Uoy era ohw.
Merrin! Merrin!
Uoy era ohw.
How's your leg?
Oh really, when?
Last month.
No.
No momma.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Why?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Amen
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Defender of the human race...
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
Don't listen.
What's this about?
Always.
I've seen him.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
It's possible. Possible however
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Very much.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
Be silent!
O'Lord hear my prey.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Just a minute.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Why not?
I'm afraid.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
No.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
Mondays.
Your pay.
Now? Why not tomorrow? After the show.
Take it now.
What about tomorrow?
We don't need you, Frankie.
It's all there. Both nights.
Look, Frankie. You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years. Couple times a month.
So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad. You could use some sun. Really.
Maybe next time.
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
I'll take her inside. You too, little Frank. Out of the pool.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Frank.
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.
What's wrong with them?
They're falling out.
Uh-oh. That's not good. Let's get him up here.
How many?
No bones.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker. We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Oh. What do you do?
Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.
Oh.
What's wrong with the kid?
Accident?
Get your hand off me.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Recognize these two characters?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Wait. Watch. Here comes Dad.
Out.
When they coming in?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
Two nights.
My pleasure.
How we doing?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
That's not the point.
What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
Frank.
Jack.
Frank. I'm here. I always get here. Don't sweat it.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair. Come on, we're on.
Lotta water.
Who's gonna make trouble? Hey, amigo!
Like an angel.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
Fuck him. Great. Terrific. Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't. They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Cindy.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Bosen black. Flat.
What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up?
Yamaha white. Nice.
Try the black Knable.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really. You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
Funny. Strike a bell?
It's only a ring. Not a collar.
It's more than that.
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Her hands. Like that.
Nothing. Everything's great. Terrific.
It's me.
Frank?
Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family. It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, okay.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle Jack.
What?
The trees. The flowers. Nice.
Terrific.
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Hey, you weren't there. Right?
Talk.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I'm grateful, Frank. How much? For the singer.
It never was.
What?
I just don't understand. You would think someone ... anyone ...
Let's get it over with.
All right. What's your name?
I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
I'll drop the eighths.
Okay?
It's early.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
She'll get here.
Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
She's here.
Here, how's this?
How about these?
Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
That's what I figure. Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah. Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Right.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
Very realistic.
Two years ago. March.
First night?
Day. Wednesday.
Last?
Sunday.
We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Pearls. White gown. Beautiful.
Not true. Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea. To Peggy Lee.
Okay.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Okay.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm,flexible.
Right.
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
Yeah. You mind?
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What?
I love you. I just wanted to say it.
I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
How dare you say you love me.
It won't happen again. Scout's honor.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Really.
Fine.
How long you been at it?
Two hours ago!
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.
She's a big girl.
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
He's with the hotel. I called him.
What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He was wearing a suit.
He had to come quickly. It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.
Celebrating. Join me?
The party's over.
Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there?
Couple years.
February?
April.
Right. It's incredible how you do that. Remember things.
A useless talent.
Yeah.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
I could've. But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
Maybe so. You ever go back there? Where it happened.
What?
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
Just until we find another girl.
Cancel, Frank.
No.
Nothing. We get nothing.
I told you, Jack. It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What's it for?
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
You don't know?
It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one
Seventy-one? What's seventy-one?
Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
What?
Shut up, Frank.
It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
No, fuck you. And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
What're you doing?
No.
Bought it on the way over. Clean as a nun.
No, it's not that. I ... can't drink from the bottle. I ... gag.
Good choice.
This'll kill 'em.
Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.
I mean, you can play. You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Five years ago. November.
Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's. Sweet sixteen.
Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare.
She asked for it.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
So what'd you think?
Thrilling. Both of you.
The audience was a little off tonight.
No, we're not. Jack?
Just call me a cab.
All right.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
What am I gonna do? Put a record player out there? Bad, Frankie. Bad.
I'm sorry?
Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
Blanche.
No romance, right? That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Candy Man.' Is that all right?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really? Isn't that a coincidence.
Yes, it is.
Well ... thanks. Bye.
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality. First rule of show business.
Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
Impersonally.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
We ran long.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
You find a girl?
What's that mean? Thirty-eight.
Catchy. You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Okay. I think that's all we need to know.
I sing now?
That's the premise.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
When we know.
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team. We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What-?
Changed?
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That! You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Come on. We don't have much time.
Time for what?
Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
A seven.
My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
We're not exactly silly with time, you know. Jack, you find anything?
Nine.
Nine?
Nine!
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Zip me up?
Right.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Don't worry. We'll take it out of your share.
You're a prince.
Piece of cake.
Switch? What fucking switch?
I said I was sorry.
Did you hear it?
Hey!
We do not take tips. I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Maybe. I'll call him.
So find a dime. Let's get out of here.
For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two. Don't forget. We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry. It only plays static.
Baker's unabridged.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
Virgins.
Virgins?
First times. Hey, look at this.
He's always right. Go ahead. Pick a virgin.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
It's paradise. That's what it is. Paradise.
Great.
Great?
Yeah.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Tell her.
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Huh?
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
Well then ... shall we?
Someone needs to grow up. I won't take it, Jack.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Uh ...
No. You listen. I had my doubts about you from the beginning
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Forget it.
Huh?
Forget it.
What?
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
What're you talking about? They love it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune. But not with each other.
Is that important?
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... thanks.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
I'll call you.
Born and bred.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Funny job.
Will I see you again?
Shit, thank God. You look like a creep.
Thanks.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Baker. Jack Baker.
Right. Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
Right. In there.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Yeah.
All right. Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it. What's he look like?
Black. Labrador.
Downstairs.
I'm tired. Really. I should get home.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer.
For a while. She left.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
I suppose.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Yes. I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
He'll come around.
Not for money. With my mother.
His kid's sick.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame. Shit.
The Stratford.
Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Forget it.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
I guess in case one year they're not.
It's okay. Last one.
Can't sleep?
In and out.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
In and out.
No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty song.
Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Better than that.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Let's make a deal. You shut up.
You were good.
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
She's four feet tall. Ed?
Ed? How many people live here?
Sure.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
Soap?
Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
No kidding?
He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Long story.
You sending me home?
He had a mind that escalated things.
So, what happened?
Ma didn't want it around. After.
Oh.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
Yeah. Got my own sign.
So ... ?
We outgrew each other.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
Vegetables.
Oh. Carrots. And peas. None of the important ones.
If I see him.
Hi.
Well, this is some surprise. Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
No.
Yeah.
Thanks. For letting me in last night.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over. Like a song.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
Eddie did.
Sounds big. What's he do?
Married.
My days are not the old days, genius.
What are they?
The recent past.
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
Looks old.
Older than me.
Wow.
Why not?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
What's a prom?
Ever go to church?
Okay. How'd yours go?
Not so good.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Yeah?
Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
Merry Christmas.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Good to see you, Ma.
Fine. You?
Oh, fine.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
I'm not much for sweets.
Eddie.
Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
He's losing his teeth.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
He hit a guard.
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
... Thanks.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Sorry, Admiral. It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Should be. It's yours.
Of course he is ... -- He's yours too.
He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.
Or reactivated the first one.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Shut up.
Let me have a look.
Like ...
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Only one you've never broken.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?" I guess they really did fuck you up.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
Something good?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
So you had a nightmare.
No.
How come?
I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.
One last time. It's important ...
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO!
Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Don't hang up ...
Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Jon, what is it?
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
That's what they always say.
Damn right.
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...
Go on.
Castor's still alive -- Technically. He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his coma.
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday. Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day. I haven't had time.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Don't count on it.
Not anymore.
It can't be. It's impossible.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Five seconds.
Not if I kill you first ...
Shoot him!
So's a noose. Now keep your mouth SHUT.
I'm going to have you fired.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Or what? You'll have me fired?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
Janie?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
I mean like protection.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Get rid of them.
The Admiral?
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
There's fun, bro. Then there's FUN.
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...
Like I fucking care? I'm not just sitting here!
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion. There's just one problem.
What's that?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever. Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital? Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor. Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games. There're leftovers in the fridge.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
No.
-- I've got to study.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
... That's great.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Great.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
-- Studying.
I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
Okay, I have a confession to make. But you aren't going to like it.
Good. Because I'm fed up.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
You? Married?
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it's led you... I'm gonna get her on the phone...
No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
I don't know. Maybe...
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
I can see that, Alan.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Im sure you do...
What about me?
I dont think youre hearing me.
Whats going on here?
But I think I like you better this way...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
Five thirty. Okay.
Bye...
Big Eds.
Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Thats where you work.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mom liked it.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
Its not Kate, is it?
Kates my wife...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.
Screw the rules. Im talking about the choice.
Its your birthday? Today? Whats your name? Where were you born?
Its me, Jack...
Howd you know my name?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
What the hell are you talking about? Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise itll be returned!
The Caddy? Why dont you take your own damn car!
Ive got all the time in the world...
No.
Yes you do...
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Hey...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Everyone needs something.
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all.
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
Thats my car! You stole my car!
Basically, its my car now. Get in.
What the hell is happening to me?!
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
What're you talkin' about?
You draw lines with pencil! I know about this!
Get out, I call 911.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Get out!
Its lovely...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
I dont think so, thank you...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Need a nurse?
Youre a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Is there something going on between us?
It would help me if we were.
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Nice night for it. I'll have Louis send your car home.
Thanks. To you too...
Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz? I dont think so...buildings closed pal. Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...
Thank you.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You want me to handle him? I think Im ready...
Okay, chief.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
What?
No, youre right. What are we doing?
We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
I dont know! Please stop yelling at me!
I was in the city.
The city? New York City? Why?
Because thats where I live.
Jack...dont even start...
You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Because youll be here.
Funny, Jack. Im laughing on the inside.
Pro bono. You dont get paid at all. Nobody makes a dime. Well, bravo...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
No, shes not.
...my feet are hurtin...
HEY!
And...?
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Im working on a new deal now...
That is the general idea, yes...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Sure. I really like Annie.
Good, Jack. Maybe well keep her.
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
If you want to look at it that way...
How would you look at it?
Sorry, Jack. Its too important to me.
I want it...
Its good, right?
What...?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.
What? You make me hot...
Wait a minute. Youre my wife?
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
But Im gettin close, right?
Okay...
Are you sure?
No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
Now...I dont...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
What are you sure about?
Ill just full yours up to the top. Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Im out of the doghouse?
Way out...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
Its like a museum.
For the week?
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell. And thats always a good thing...
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
Its good to see you...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Thats the one...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Jack.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Hello Jack. You dont have to stop singing on my account...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
And God love you for it.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
Aspen.
Not by a long shot.
Do I know you?
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...
But youre not interested in boutique dollars... I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Okay, Ill take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
Is there anything I can do for you?
Im sorry, no...
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.
Thanks. You're not bad yourself...
I'd like that, too.
Tonight.
So we'll get egg nog.
I'm taking the train...
I've got plenty of places to go.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Merry Christmas...
Christmas? It cant be Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
Yes!
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
I mean...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could <u>save lives</u>.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
<u>Should</u>?
Ben. This is serious. <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
Reed. Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
Am <u>I</u> okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you <u>think</u>? With <u>Sue</u>.
Is it safe?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him. It's <u>them</u>. I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
What about you?
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
<u>Now</u>.
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude. That's my sister.
You gave us <u>names</u>? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis. Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
And if he's not...?
Reed's <u>always</u> right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Showtime.
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation... How's the other matter?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Not at all.
Hilarious.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Never better.
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh...good.
You always had a way with words. I should be getting back.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
We need to get past them.
What...? <u>Oh</u>.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door. Ergo...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
I gave him twenty.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A <u>gasket</u>? Reed, we're at a party.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
No...
The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
Message to Proteus.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up! Contact the Proteus!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
<Me>?
Here's the Surgeon.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Come along, they'll be operating shortly. See you later, Mike.
No question of her loyalty.
Say that again?
Trip? Where to?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
Where can I get a cab back to town?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Difficult? He's impossible!
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
We must!
With no laser --
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Yes, Cora.
I -- I want to say...
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
But big enough for us...
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
You may learn to like it.
Now I know...
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Not anything built into the chassis. If it hadn't come loose --
A surgeon might...
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
What gives you that idea?
What do you mean?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
It's too late now. We must go on.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Nothing -- against all that force.
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
What's that?
The Breath of God...
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Oxygenation...
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
What about Dr. Michaels?
It's too late!
At an operation?
How are you, Miss Peterson?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Send the following message...
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Two in a row?
It's possible --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
Where we going?
Go ahead.
I'm married.
And she said it was indelible...
Sort of.
That makes two of us.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission... Get this on. Hurry!
We can get out through the Lab Section.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Then don't drift down further.
I'll do what I can.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
The Wall's transparent...
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
What do you mean?
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Can I see your license and registration please?
Certainly.
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't think so. It's nice.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Would it kill you to say something?
I did.
Huh? Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
I need ...unguent.
Whoa, Daddy.
Yeah.
Jezhush.
We split that.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Okay.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
We need more -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
I'll see you tomorrow.
GOT IT?
Okay, real good, then.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
End a April.
Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, yah, I know that!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
You have children?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
Yah, right-o.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Ya got that right.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
Chaska.
In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
And what about the other fella?
Oh, yah?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Uhn.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Oh, man!
Hold on.
Yah, right -
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
Ya kiddin'!

Huh? Yah?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -

Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.

So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.

Okay.
Okay, real good, then.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well... yah.

Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well, what do ya mean?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
What the - how's Jean?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.

Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'?
We might be innarested.

What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
...Huh?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way!
No, see -
Mm.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Carl somethin'?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Yah?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Oh, yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
No way.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Yah...
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Oh...

Oh, pretty good.

Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?

Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

Norm?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -

No. No. They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Oh. Oh, my.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Oh. Geez.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
We've got a -
There's the car! There's the car!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Love ya, Margie.
Yah?
Prowler needs a jump.
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Uh-huh.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, ya think?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
No, no.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
Norm, that's terrific!
It's terrific!
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Yah, I guess.
That's terrific.
I love you, Norm.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
He's at -
Well -
Well... Why don't we...
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
The garden. Take him there. Move, people. Let's do this!
No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really? Great. Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Really, what's that?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Oh.
You are?!
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
Yes.
Some of it, yes.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image.
Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
I'll ask the questions, son.
Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
Sure.
I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
What?
Practicing what?
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
Yeah.
Really?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
Please. Can't we do something... ?
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three.
We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.
I suppose.
Marla?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
So you're staying in tonight?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
What... ?
What the hell are you doing here?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Worth every penny.
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Please.
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
No, thanks.
Good.
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
No.
Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Nothing.
No... no problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
It was the smart move on her part.
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject?
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me... Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away!
Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is this a trick?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Say my name! What's my name!?
Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there...
The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
I've done you enough favors.
I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
Marla...
No, no, shut up! I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
What?! You're sorry? I don't believe that for a minute.
I'm begging you. Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Don't ask.
Yes.
I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who's this?
I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
You fucking slut!!
... You know me?
Is this a test, sir?
Yes... it's a test.
You were in here last Thursday night.
What?
Is this part of the test?
Excuse me? "Throwers?"
Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Yeah, uh huh... yeah? Oh...
You're a tourist. I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Tyler Durden.
No, supply oxygen?
Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork. I get it. You're very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
What?
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
And, now it's gone.
All gone.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Do what you like.
God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
Yeah.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
A nice, big cock.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
You get the idea.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it? In the face?
Surprise me.
Like hell. That counted.
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
This fight, pussy.
Anyone.
My dad. No question.
What car?
Hum.
What?
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
Show-off.
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. William Shatner.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You?
Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
He was obviously able to handle it.
No. Not at all.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
That was three times you promised.
Uh... nah...
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
Shhhhhh! I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
Don't mention me.
A liposuction clinic.
Look at your hand.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
We don't need him...
We don't... ?
You quit?
Yeah. Where you headed?
Work. Going to work.
Nothing. Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
Okay, and... and...
I heard. Local 15, Monday nights.
I thought you did.
Homework assignment.
What is it?
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
No.
What should I have told you?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
You know what I mean.
What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to know --
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I'm not asking you to.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
What?
Nothing.
... is over.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
I don't know! Tell me!
Is this really news to you?
What are you talking about... ?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Um, well... technically, no.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
...your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
You don't know that. There could still be people inside.
If you know, I know.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green? Did you say green?
Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I'm serious. That's the wrong one.
You want out?
I quit.
What?
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
I think this is about where we came in.
It's out of our hands. This is it.
Please...
Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10... 9... 8....
Paraffin.
What?
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Proceed with remote detonation.
Why what?
Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
... no, no, no...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I swear on my life, I won't...
You will. You know you will.
What have you left for me?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
What?
My eyes are open.
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Well, sir, you said you might.
No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson?
Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you...
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine? Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
Thank you. Thank you, sir...
Let go of me!!
How'd you know?
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.
Yesssss...
"Stuff." Were the mid-terms hard?
Why?
I... I don't know...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
Too much school.
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
What list?
Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
I hope you're ready for this.
I...I...
How you doing in there, hero?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Speed up.
Yeah, fuck 'em. No offense.
I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Taken care of.
Don't sweat it. It's over.
She had the baby?
Random, sure.
Blow me.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Who?
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Take my van!
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Maybe. What's this about?
May we come in?
No. What's this about?
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
She did.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
...My Premonition was just like his.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
They're next on the list. We have to find them.
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
He can't breathe damn it. I think his lung's collapsed!
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
I wasn't worried about us.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I know how it feels to be dead.
Impossible. She was on the onramp.
I know. I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I can live with thaaaa --
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
Sure.
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
I...I don't know.
I guess so.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
Hey, Dad. What's up?
I mean it. Take care of it.
I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
That it's not over yet.
I love you too, Dad. Goodnight.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah?
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Nice try, kiddo.
He's not a witch.
I'm... really sorry.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Thirty-nine.
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
Right. April 25th.
Most kids never have it happen.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Nothing is... anymore.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car!
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
All I owe is these people. To live my life to the fullest.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Why do you think I was hiding?
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No. I saw it. I saw it!
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
I know who you are.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
That's what I'm doin'!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Huh?
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
What just happened?
Really? How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Oh, yeah. Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Star Wars?
No.
Ninety.
Yeah. Second set. Let's go.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Read you.
Home on my strobe.
Keep it down, man. I got problems.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Where's your stuff?
There's a compass in the handle.
Exactly.
No.
I've seen worse places.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
Damn! Leeches.
No cigarettes.
I had it cupped.
Fermented fish sauce.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
Yeah...
She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners.
Pirates? No kidding?
I need a vacation.
American?
Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Let me see.
Alright. Home run.
Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks.
Bastards. Let's get some shots.
Nothing we can do, man.
I suppose you have...
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Yes.
What... whattaya do?
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose. Here, gimme a hand.
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
It means "virgin." My mother was comedian.
Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years.
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
Spooks?
Intelligence work.
Oh. They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon. Make deal.
Where's his father?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there. He's probably digging every minute. Got a surfboard. Breaking girls' hearts.
Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.
Why'd they want us?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio. Make deal. More than we pay.
Took bus, most of way. I knew you would come here.
Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
In-vul-nerabo. But you get ass kicked without me.
Yeah. Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Go United States. See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics. Buy Cadillac. Watch "Dynasty."
I couldn't get you in.
How?
Minigun. Come on. Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
It doesn't hurt. Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir. Can't do it.
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.
Why me?
Not yet.
I'm not jumping blind.
We just take pictures?
Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
That's right.
Typical...
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay. Just came through.
What?
Christ almighty.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
What?
He... took it.
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
Couple hours. Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Have fun.
What that?
American. Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Can you walk?
I could a couple of days ago. Gonna be... stiff.
De Fravio. Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Colonel.
Mind if I sit down?
I could take it or leave it.
That's it. My life.
Those men are all dead.
You're not.
Yeah. Big time.
What did you want?
This just occurred to somebody, now?
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You got it, sir.
Yeah.
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes! They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
No, thank you.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Yeah!
The nails!! Watch the nails!!... Listen, you still have to eat.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
Why this is outrageous!...
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
<u>What</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>! <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
You're all right... you sure...
I... I stayed at a friend's. Listen, I --
Okay. ... I love you...
You still believe in God?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?! Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid. It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He just needs some clothes?
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
My agent. I called my agent.
You're kidding! What did he say?
Thanks.
No, it's not... Come here...
"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
How have you been?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Uh... basement I think...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No... He is supposed to live there?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
He's not here.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where? Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
I... I was just leaving.
Good. You believe this drunk?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yeah? Who is this?
Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
<u>No!</u> <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
Yes. They're free.
How much?
Well, since you're a member, we could...
Tonight! How's tonight?
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
Lydia. Lydia what?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place. ...UH...WARREN!
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're -- -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
Sshhhh!
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Take a guess... <u>Let him guess</u>!! <u>Tch</u>.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
The Little...
They work for Him.
Him...?
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
I don't know.
Fifty dollars?
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You really want to help me?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
The Red Knight!
The Red...? You're totally gone, aren't you?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
It's a classic.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Bingo!
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Sure...
<u>Parry</u>! Close your pants...
What are the other reasons?
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving.... Am I doing that?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You advise us!
You're out numbered son.
OWW...MAN...
You won't be alone for long.
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
I don't like horror movies!
What a gyp.
Yeah.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
There isn't any more to tell.
Don't say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
Will you stop!... ... I'm in love with you...
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
A wig?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
No.
You said.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
No, dammit, I would easy.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That's right, hand.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I did, didn' I, El?
You got another ball comin'.
I'm not.
You just going to sit there?
Yes.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I hope they do.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I'm sorry.
Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.
You'll be gone, period.
I love it.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
What the hell is that?
I'll tell you... ... l-a-t-e-r.
Shut up! All of you!
No.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
It brings out my eyes...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Okay...
What?
Just finish eating.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I don't, huh?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
No.
You got any change?
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
Alaska.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Shut up. You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
No. How much do I owe you?
Five'll do it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Are you talking to us?
Am I on TV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
No, I'm not... I'm not.
That's good.
Don't, then.
Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.
Thank you... Oh no, don't put it on there...
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Oh.
You know who it once belonged to?
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
No kidding.
Very nice.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
What?
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's had two strokes.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No...
Wait...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Yeah, me, too...
All right...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
A couple of months.
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Like what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I don't know.
What?
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Yeah, well, he's...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
I guess you fell in the water.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
Why?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
I was really very moved by the way you...
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
Then I must have been supplying it.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
At being a fake.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Some bath oil?
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Shut up...
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
Yes.
Yeah, I think I could.
What?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
Yes, it is!
Will you let me talk to you, please?
What?! I can't hear you!
Catherine...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
Is she?
Thanks, Carl...
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
At game, Carl.
All right, let's have a rematch.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
Will you shut up for a minute!! Pull your car out of line.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Not at all.
It's a Borzoi.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
I hope I didn't hear that.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Well, I should hope not...
Jesus, what a rude person...
That's an old maid's tale.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Hold onto this.
Pardon me?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Fine.
Look at me.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
Not now, I'm busy
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Is it true?
I'm wit' Carlos.
Victor.

Victor.
Wussup.
Hi.

Um. Yeah! Shorty!

A play-ya.
You got a boyfriend?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
Just chill.
That's it?
Nah, we make out and stuff.
You look good.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
How you treat them?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
I kissed those girls.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't!
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.

She fucks it all up!

Where you goin'?

Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
C'mon.
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
Which one?
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
What you want with her anyway'
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.

Yeah.
Okay, then dance. Show.

She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
Positive.
You sure?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
What?
Nothing.
So, then whadda ya want?
Not really.
Hey!
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
You gotta girLfrLend?
Nah.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
Comanche Indian.
Would you like me to change anything?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
You mean her.
What?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Fletch, this is dumb.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
It was planted on me, sir.
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
That a boy.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
What?
You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
My lawyer was a bum.
I agree.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Of course.
Wait a second --
Cut the crap and read it.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Velma.
Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Oh, about ten days ago.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Since he moved to L.A.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Then he has.
Course he has. That's his wife.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Of course they are.
Where are you going?
You sure did.
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
What are you doing here?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
What?
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
What's that?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Twenty years.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Why not?
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Alan Stanwyk.
Charmed.
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
Come inside.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
In this drawer....
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Shoot.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Not me.
No problem, boss.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Spot right here.
You doing a story on this guy?
Maybe.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Only one way to find out.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
You've met her?
Cute thing.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
John! You used to fly together!
John Ultrarelamensky.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.
So were my parents.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I love the outfits.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
See what I mean?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Hi.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Down boy.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Here, take mine.
Yes.
God...
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
Good point.
He never sees them and I never met them.
How come?
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What are you talking about?
That's what I want to know.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
You saw a forgery.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
No.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Gail, please.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Very good sir.
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Very good, sir.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
I commend him on his choice
Who are you?
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
Moved out.
She moved out?
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Uh, almost.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Irwin...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
...never reads the paper...
I don't know. Look!
Looks great.
Practically.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How gray?
I'd say charcoal.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Get out of here.
I want something I can print!
Print this Frank.
What? Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
What...
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Forget it.
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Not really?
I was upset.
Yeah.
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
My secretary.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Of course.
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Please.
Some fag. Charged me up the ass.
Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Uh, let's go sit down.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Zuzu Petals! Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Hold that thought. Are we being shot at?
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Thanks, I needed that.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy. Can't we bring up the bass.
Right away!
Could somebody tell me what's going on? <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
No prob...
All your friends call you Jazz.
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz? Don't do this to me.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it. It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we...
Celebrate? Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders? Forget it, man.
Contacts.
I like.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Hello... It's Colleen. With answers. She wants to meet. Down. Way down-town. Late.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Who?
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance! Get that music off!
You're not funny.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Thanks. You interested. It's festival seating, so...
How much?
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Oh. Three hundred coming right up.
Fluck you!
What?
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Peachy.
Why are all these people after me?
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit! Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life. Here's our stop...
Friends? You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask. Have you ever thought about mousse?
People still watch that?
Who cares about people?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Okay? I just blew up. I feel orgasmic.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet. Put in Colleen's disc. Number two.
Ye-ah.
But you know, that was just a dream. Doesn't really count.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
This is fucking unbelievable. Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
You wish. Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Yeah, Ford. I'm okay.
Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin.
Forget it.
Twelve pack?
Did he just say what I think he said?
I don't need it that bad.
Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar! You don't care! About anything.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Yeah, go on...
Good news is that yeah, I found him. The bad news is...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Case closed, okay? Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what? Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh, but I am. Dianetics, Ford. You should try it.
Say cheese...
Okay. 'B-y-e!
Let me go out like a man.
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Go on, another time, another place.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Are you okay?
Oh, wait. One sec. Open the window.
Ciao.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Fuck me...
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute. You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh. Hebedeebuh. Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us! It's computerised.
What?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
No.
Cause if I do.
Everything is everything.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
There's nothing around. Nobody's holding.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing. There's only some talk.
What?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who brings it?
Where do you want it?
This side.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Well try, okay?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --
Yeah?
Don't forget anchovies.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Henri... I need one more favor from you. I know I am imposing...
Who's this --
... Salvatore?...
Yes --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
It's yours too!
Si tu veux.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Formidable! Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker. Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Comment va-t-elle?
Non!
I'm going to put them on the cat.
That's a relief.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
But will they?
Mmmmm. That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo. I'm in show business.
S'right.
What?
Fake it.
He got off on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
No, I figure he stays here. Where's your registration?
Names.
Where from?
Des Moines.
What's he do?
Businessman. Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
Yeh? Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
This Charnier guy. He's in shipping?
I think so. But they're in Room 408. On the fourth floor.
Marseilles.
Yeah, I know.
Willie Mays.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
Morning. Sometime.
Who's on him?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Tumble it. One end to the other.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
He coulda been white.
Not a chance.
Drink this.
Whip it out.
Policy man in Queens.
What about the last of the big-time spenders. You make him?
Hunh-uh. Check the bread. He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
He probably sells insurance. Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Come on -- just for fun --
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Toy wit' this will ya.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Suspicion of what?
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
We're goin' now! Goodbye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy. Open the door.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed. With my own cuffs.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Sixty days. Here. Don't mention it.
Pour it in your ear.
We put him to bed for the night.
Four.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Whatta you got?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Nothing.
Yeah.
They around?
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
We tried. Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Baltimore?
The game, Graham. The Series?
Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with me. This is what we do.
I seem nervous, huh?
Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this.
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
Then fuckin' find it. I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
The usual.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Sure.
Nothing. I just wanted to see you.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear. What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
Do you know how much I love you?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Honey, what is it? Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know. He loves that thing.
No. Not our Johnny. I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
I think you know, Frank.
No, I don't.
Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that.
About what?
Let's go. Do us both a favor.
Do you know where I found this?
No. This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh.
How's that?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard.
No kidding. I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW. Come get me.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Get him home safe.
I know. Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
No, but we can. We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Wait...
I'm right here behind you...
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Name's John.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Hello?
I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it?
Huh?
The World Series. You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon.
This afternoon?
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
W...B...2...YXB.
29-years ago.
I'm dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream.
I'm not dreaming.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What?
You just burned the desk.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five? That would make it...
1998.
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay. I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It did, Pop. It did.
When?
October 12, 1969.
Tomorrow. Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
I don't understand.
Chief?! Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Tell me.
What, Johnny? What is it?
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What? Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What? What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died. It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
October 22, 1969.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now. How?
Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work. They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do? You don't even know who this guy is.
I do know. I'm a cop. This is what I do.
Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
Whatta we do now?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
You there?
H-hi.
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Johnny, I know, but...
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him! Dad you got him!
What?
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
Hang on.
Dad, you there?
Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John...
We did it, John. We stopped him.
What's wrong?
I don't remember. Why don't I remember?
Sully! Is that you?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I talked to him Gordo. I talked to my Dad.
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
I know pal. I remember. Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Better.
Longbranch...?
What?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer. Ten years ago.
The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
How'd you know my name, mister?
Nothing you're willing to do.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming. I talked to him, it was real.
Yeah. That's it.
Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot. We pull on this string...
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
What?
Yeah. Sure.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Close.
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
Yeah, that's right.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Glad you did. Come on in. Buy you a cup of coffee?
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Oh. Sorry. How so?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
I look familiar?
No. What house you work?
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right...
You have the right to speak to an att --
Fuck you, asshole.
It's a small world, Carl. And I'm gonna find you. Real soon.
Where are you going?
Going? How do you mean?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
"He" wanted me to warn you. Look at this, all of you!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
Same thing.
Yes, you can. Come on, Shelly!
I did?! I broke the world's record.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is. I was just kidding.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Cool it, Andy.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
No way. We're pregnant. Remember?
Where's Shelly?
I don't know...
We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.
Not now. I'm cold.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
If you insist.
I'll think of something.
I vote for me.
I vote for the hammock.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
You're too clean for me.
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What?
Sure.
Yes, man!
I love you, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't. We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know. I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
A hammock?
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Why?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Hello. How are you?
I don't know.
You're irresistible. I lose control.
What?
Nothing.
Did you stay here last night?
No. I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm serious. Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Are you all right, Shelly?
What do you mean?
I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
I'm sorry.
My whole world.
In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Not us! He's really creepy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
May be please have the wallet.
Yes.
Gulp!
Keep looking.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Stop the car! Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it. I can tell.
You're wrong.
Great. Just great.
Who's Horace?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
What? Who pulled it out?!
No way... ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?
Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
We're gonna scare him?!
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us.
Just drive. He'll get out of our way.
That's it. We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
I wish it was.
Whaddya mean?
Happy Friday the 13th.
Sheriff, you better take this.
Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot you.
You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
I could swear I heard...
This is taking forever. I'm starving.
Yeah, that's fat too.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We have! Trying to track you down. The phone there is disconnected.
And make sure my daughter stays put... ...She's grounded.
Uh...yes. But...
Okay. There's one.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
I hope so.
Did you hear me?!
Yes. And I said, hand me those padlocks.
There was this monster. He was after me. He wanted to kill me.
No, he was real. Like on TV.
Nancy.
No more.
I found it outside.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
Huh?
Who ya calling?
We'll scare 'em right back.
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Don't piss me off, junior. Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do something. He's even more powerful now that...
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes, but they released me because...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I've seen it.
Please, Sheriff. You'll see we dug it up.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Yes.
No. Not here. Come by my house tonight at eleven. Don't be late.
The what?
Save your...
I'm here.
I'm scared. I'm very scared.
Yes.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You food'll be right out.
Twenty.
Look --
Thirty. Name your price. Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
You know what I want. You know why I need you.
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
So's he and he knows it.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
Why don't you blow me, Chief. After your girlfriend gets through.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Take him to my car. I'll be out in a minute.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
She's yours?
Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Absolutely. The church even sent me an autographed picture of God. Ward!
Next, you dial a number.
Sorry, I'm working now. You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
Have a good night.
Yeah...
Gotta go. See you guys later.
I'm sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
Are you crazy?!
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this. Just hang tight. Okay?
Okay.
He was dead. He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
About Jessica.
-- Bad?!
-- Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
She did!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she? Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
Never.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Jason...Voorhees?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
Really?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
But...wait a minute!
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Tell me.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
No.
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
The fire alarm...
This is Jason's fault!
Not another word, do you hear me??
We have to get off this ship!!
Don't be ridiculous!
Nothing.
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Where is she?
Oh dear God...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded... It's no coincidence.
Walking corpses are not real!
What are you talking about?
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Am I? Let's find out.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm staying.
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
This isn't a request.
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Just felt a little chill.
Really?
I don't know what to say...
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Yeah...a lot.
I gathered that.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Yes...
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
What do you mean???
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
Is the ship going to sink??
But Rennie...
I'm not!!
Drugs... Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Please, hurry...
Where you're going, mister?
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Do not inhale.
That's where I peed.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Alla puttanesca.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
I don't want to hear about it.
Shut up, Elliot.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
That's awful.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
Then you should carry a gun.
Where is it?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
That was a big mistake.
No, we're not.
He'll hate it.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
Classic.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
The Red Sox
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
We don't even like each other, do we?
They'll lose because they're my team.
He will absolutely hate it.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Why do you need a radio?
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
She is kicking you out.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Opening night?
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm not sure.
Everything.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Daddy, wait.
It's only our first date.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
First you tell me.
Brilliantly moving.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
A flat-out hit.
Yes.
This building is not secure.
What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Yes.
It's your best play, Nicky.
See, Daddy.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
Two-all after six.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
How prominent?
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
I don't know if I can say that.
Washed away.
One more out.
A thousand things.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
You know the answer to that.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I know, Pop.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Oh yeah?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
A grandmother. God bless you.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
That's a simple subject.
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Life is good.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Matthew.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Because life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Why do you care?
They're my team.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Eleventh inning. What else?
You're not making sense.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Why?
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes, Peter.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Burnt sienna.
Mine was cobalt blue.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
There was a review.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
One more time.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
But you're his friend.
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
Yes.
Never mind.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Yes.
He goes to the theater armed.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I haven't come to you.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
I don't want you, Steven.
I'm going home to my machine.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Are you sure?
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
It is the work of untouchables.
All the more reason.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
One more.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
Well, we shall try.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Going nearer to God!
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Back in South Africa... long time ago.
What was he like?
He said he's in charge...
"Hell!"
A -- a week.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
Panditji -- please, help me.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
I hope not.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
A great deal.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I would rather march.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
There is nothing I can give.
That was England.
The fools! Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
Thank you. No.
I dined at the prison.
Ahh.
Somehow I expected not.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Oh! Neither have I. I'm awfully sorry.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Have you found him?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's over.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.
You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.
Now is your chance to find out.
Too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
Er, no...
It would be five thousand more.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No? What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll take care of it.
Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Grudges?
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
What a pity.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Something's not right.
He's not here. It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Get it. From outside, if you have to.
From what budget?
Where do we start?
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
Where did you get this?
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
What a relief.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
Thank you, no.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"?
It's about the Director.
Again?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
You have more in common than you know.
Six one.
He's too tall.
Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?
Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this.
You had to be a right-hander.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
<i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Keep going!! Keep going!!
What <i>is</i> that one?
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
In a corridor.
Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye.
I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
I'm sure I could have.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so. The stripe.
Good choice.
I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know. She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I'm sorry. I've got plans.
Again?
She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
Will you be okay?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I was never very good at it, remember?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
I could always walk. I've been faking it.
Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down. I've found him.
No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
There's a way.
Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
I've found him too.
A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find?
No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
I know about you.
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody.
You celebrate, Jerome?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.
You'll be next.
Of course.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here? Let me order for you.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
Who are they?
It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.
Come on.
My medication. I left it back there.
We'll get it later. Irene, please.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
We could go together one day.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
No, you don't understand. I <i>can't</i>.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Honey, look around you. The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
Antonio--
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
I get my own help.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
News said two persons killed.
And you got him...
That's right.
What about her? Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No way. I always do my own work.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
No. My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Hi.
You okay?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Sure...
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Sure.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really?
Really.
Better than I remembered.
You were asleep.
I bought you a lot of new things.
Suit yourself.
Is he straight?
You got the parole, didn't you?
I couldn't have... much longer.
Yeah... I know.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
My mind's not on guessing games.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
That bad?
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
I see it...
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Why?
There are three men dead.
Do it my way.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth...
What do we do?
We keep going.
And switched keys.
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Fifteen minutes.
Sure?
You bastard...
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
I mean it.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Like what?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I didn't mean police.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
When are you going to learn?
I did I killed a man.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
I think so... I don't know.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Yeah.
Sure...
I don't want to hear it.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I guess you're right.
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
I don't see how.
You and me.
Can we make it?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Who was it?
Just get your clothes on...
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Yeah.
Pull over.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
I guess we are.
We walk.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Yeah... I guess it does.
No, I'm afraid not.
I never have any luck.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Oh my God.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
All right. Shells?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
Where?
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
What about you?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
What about the vault?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Wire pull over?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'm good at that.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Whatever you need.
What do you have in mind?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Right.
Then you do it.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Why not?
I kinda doubt it.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Not now.
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Go with God.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Can he trust you?
That's what matters, isn't it?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I'll tell you when.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I know. I know.
I know.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
How?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
And you told Brumby?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Was he?
Well?
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Never mind.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Christ, what...
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Jack...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
That's nice.
Confidential, like.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
I can't Jack. How can I?
Yes you can.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Brumby!
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Fine... I want to talk to you.
What about?
Doreen.
Killed? I don't know anything about it.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.
I can't.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
No, do you really?
Go on.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Really?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
No.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Could you please put my glass on the table?
No. I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Of course. Where else?
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
We're there now.
Brumby.
Is he coming here?
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Now you're asking.
Especially when I play the lead.
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Who set it up? Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
No.
Nice of you to come.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Have another?
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
Yes.
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
No.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
What?
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
Nobody seems to know.
Yes.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's what he was saying about you.
Nowt.
Good lad.
Where you off to?
Las Vegas.
How many?
Four of them.
Who's Brumby?
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
How'd you find me?
No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Get knotted.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Oh yes? How?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Definitely.
Will this do?
Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
You sure?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny. Can I phone London?
It'll cost you.
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No, you won't.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
No.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
No.
Do you want breakfast?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well?
Uh-huh.
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
No. I'm not tired, Do you eat breakfast?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Funny, that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yeah, Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Making a living.
Still got a sense of humour?
Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Still got your sense of humour.
Piss off, Ray.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
But they have to be diplomatic.
The gun he means.
Shut up.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That's right, Harry.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether?
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Shut up.
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em. They, hey: it happens to us all.
Where am I going to work?
I'm not?
You had to, yeah. Why?
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
You did?
I...I don't know.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
You're on this...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not right.
No.
Eh...?
That's right?
Eh?
No. That's absolutely right.
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
For some sales pro...
Yes, it is. And you know who's responsible?
Who?
He's doing very well.
I heard that they were running cold.
The nurses?
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well. He's doing very well.
With River Oaks?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Yes. It is. It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
What hard part?
Just the act.
What act?
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the truth...
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it! Men come...
Men come work for you...
They...
They have...
When they...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
What do you mean?
Somebody...
Yes...?
Should do something to them.
What?
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
How?
How? Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
What?
Huh.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff? Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him about this?
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
We're just speaking about it. As an idea.
As an idea.
Yes.
We're not actually talking about it.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?! No.
Well. Well...
Hey.
Not actually, no.
No. Not actually.
Did you?
What did you say?
Yes. I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George? We're just talking...
We are?
That's right. It's a crime. It is a crime. It's also very safe.
You're actually talking about this?
That's right.
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
What did he say? He'd buy them.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
He would take you on. Yes.
What? What? The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You...
I'm sorry?
You.
You have to go in. You have to get the leads.
I...
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Yes.
What does that mean?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Yes. I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
...they take me, then. They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Me?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory. Before the fact.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why? Why, because you only told me about it?
That's right.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why? Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money? Is that the...
Yes.
Because you listened.
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
What do you care...?
Yeah. That's swell. Yes. You're right. How are you?
I'm fine. You mean the board? You mean the board...?
I don't...yes. Okay, the board.
Well, they're old. I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Yes.
Huh?
Yes. They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
Clear Meadows. That shit's dead.
It's a waste of time.
Yes. I'm no fucking good.
That's...
Everything I...you know...
They stole the...
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Down the street.
...what am I going to do all month...
Were the leads insured?
What?
To the cops?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's swell. Another waste of time.
A waste of time? Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
The cops?
Yes. The cops. No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Why? Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where were you?
Where was I?
Yes.
I was at home, where were you?
At home.
Was I?
Yes.
No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah. You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Yes.
Where did Moss...? I...
Will you excuse us please?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant? I...I...
You understand?
Did they catch...?
No.
Oh, God, I hate this job.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Fuck. I had them on River Glen.
You...
That's great.
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I didn't rob...
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George...
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
That they're going to be upset.
That's right. You want to go out today...?
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in. I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Excuse me, sir...
Did they get my contracts?
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who are you?
How the fuck do I know? What...talk to me.
Please don't leave. I'm going to talk to you. What's your name?
Are you talking to me?
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Levene!!
I've...look. Will someone get this guy off my back.
You have a problem?
You call them again. Mr. Williamson...!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
And let's put this together. Okay? Shel? Say okay.
What two?
Four. You had four leads. One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...you want to see the court records? John? Eh? You want to go down...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...no...
...then...
...I only...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that? What is that...?
All that I'm saying...
Under him?
Moss.
...you talk to Murray...
I have. And my job is to marshal those leads...
Yes. I am. I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Let me...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Yes.
John. John...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly. Please. Murray told me: the hot leads...
I'm out.
Yes.
I'll tell you why I'm out. I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John.
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
What if you don't close...?
And fifty bucks a lead.
I saw the board. You've got four...
I've got Roma. Then I've got Moss...
Good. Now we're talking.
Now. Yes...When?
I'm asking you. As a favor to me? John. John: my daughter...
I can't do it, Shelly...
Because I say so.
Is that it? Is that it? You want to do business that way...?
Yeah. Yeah.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
Somebody broke in.
The leads are coming.
Get 'em to me!
What does that fucking mean?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
It's not impossible.
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
What?
How do you know I made it up?
What are you talking about?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Well, hadn't it?
No. It hadn't.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
You robbed the office.
Sure! I robbed the office. Sure.
How much did you get for them? How much did you get for them?
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Uh-huh?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Mmm.
I...
Abso...
Forget it. Frame it. It's worthless.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. I'm busy now...
Their check's no good? They're nuts...?
Call up the bank. I called them.
You did?
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this: I said...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shit.
"'Why? Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
And did they steal the contracts...?
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them. As I do, as anyone does..."
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
What does that mean?
That's right.
Shelly...!
Hey, big fucking deal. Broke a bad streak...
They took the phones...
They...
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
Guess who?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Fuck her...
The hell with him. We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Kenilw...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek. Yes. In Florida?
Yes.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Sure.
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh! For the magazine...
Yes. Is this something that I can talk ab...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure. Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Go ahead.
Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you have...?
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh! My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
No. You said the one. That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Ricky...
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes.
Mmmm...
Well, let's have a couple more. My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Lingk. James Lingk.
Jim! What are you doing here? Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Why did she do that, Jim?
To...you know.
To change our minds.
Of course you have three days.
But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba...
Three business days. They mean three business days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I don't understand.
That's what they are. Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
I'm not.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
Tell me again.
Tell me again. Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No. She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She won't listen.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
I do. If I don't get my money back...
What does that mean?
That...
I...
What...?
I...
What...? Say the words.
I don't have the power. I said it.
What power?
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what? To negotiate what?
This.
What, "this"?
And the check is...
What did I tell you? What did I say about the three days...?
It's nothing.
What are the police doing here...?
Not to my knowledge, no...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View. Eight units.
Yeah. He closed a deal.
Eight units. Mountain View.
You did that?
Guess who?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
They took 'em...
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home. I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
And fuck you. Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They didn't get my contracts.
They--excuse me...
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
The...
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk. I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
It went down. I filed it.
You did?
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what? With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
I'm giving you three leads. You...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Yes. Please. Please. The police can be...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk. James Lingk. Your contract went out. Nothing to...
John...
Your contract went out to the bank.
Yes.
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
They were friends.
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know. How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator. We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
No. He would give it away. I know how to repay a consideration.
Oh yes, the very best.
What? You read it in the papers?
Go on, answer him when he talks to you. Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
She couldn't decide.
He's going to kill Fanucci.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Bought at the airport.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
No.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Relax, Freddie honey. Come dance with me.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
No, Dad.
Now what is this talk about joining the army? Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I understand...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
You're a good fellow.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
It's all right. He stays with me all the time.
Oh. Mikey, what's up? I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five-Angels? Anybody?
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?
That's what I'm here for.
Wait'll you see!
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No. I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
Nowhere, Mike. I wanted to get a refill. How about you?
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
A pig of a Neaponitan.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful. For me, there is only my wife!
I know. That's why I brought you with me!
What?
Chi?
Roberto. Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Within the compound will be fine.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
I don't know.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
Connie's outside.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
If I'm wrong...
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Wait... there's something else.
Alright.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me? The baby?
I don't know.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
That plane goes to Miami...
I want it met.
They are everywhere!
Good. Then you're staying.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The room has a bug in it.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.
Tom, what do I do now?
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
Do you gamble?
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.
Thanks...friend.
I don't think that's necessary.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through.
I'm going to the market.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
This is my boy, and my wife. Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
You haven't heard me.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
You said you were Klingman.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
Get out of my hotel.
I'm alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight. How are your eyes?
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
But times are different...
Not for a few years.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
However I can help you...
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Except the President of the United States.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
So, that occurred to me.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
How is his health?
Not good.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Okay. You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Yes.
When do we talk?
After dinner.
Says who?
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Good.
I thought we would meet alone.
Keep them alive.
It's important.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got no choice.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Eh... Five dollars more.
Yes.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I won't keep you another minute...
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Not anymore you don't. Doll.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that! We are watching my fucking movie.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
Weird.
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I didn't mean to...
Sure. I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
The Master is waiting for you.
What're you talking about?
What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?
You will not hurt him?
Expect nothing fancy.
That's okay, Hanna. I'm more comfortable in here. It is Hanna, isn't it?
Long enough. Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? Movie stars?
Your wife?
I'm not married.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Of course. I am married still.
Yeah? What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
Yes! You know?
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
No!
Yes. I trust you.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I put him to bed. He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself.
But I didn't do this!
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
We have his note.
Mornin'.
My name is Whale. This is my house.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Boone. Clayton Boone.
The Marines. Good for you. You must have served in Korea.
Yeah. I better get on with my work.
Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you.
No. Iced tea's fine.
Splendid.
What? Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say. If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What was wrong?
Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken. How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.
Yes. You were a Marine.
Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time.
You don't say? Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man." Shall we begin?
It's new.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Of course not. As I said, only poor people --
What?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
All right, I guess.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
Did you now?
I liked it. We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
No.
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
I don't like to talk about that.
Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
All righty. I understand.
No. At least not in the legal sense.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What way might that be?
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry. Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on.
Not at the moment.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years --
Better work.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand?
Oh no. I never swim.
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not me.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't.
Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.
You were a soldier?
I was an officer.
Of course I remember. Do you think I'm so senile --
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait. You cannot force what will not flow.
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Clayton is fine.
Do I look okay?
If that's okay?
Nothing would please me more.
I don't hear anything.
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
No. The girl.
Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Monsters? The only monsters... ...are here.
Can't you see? It's raining!
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
We're not sugar. We won't melt.
Catch my death.
Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Good. Let's get dry.
Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
Why not? Give us something to do while we wait.
Never gave it much thought.
But you said --
-- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.
The Great War?
I didn't have the guts for it.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one. A very good story indeed.
Not at all.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't remember that one.
James Whale. This afternoon at the party.
But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Your friend?
What'd you say?
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect? Bronze?
Don't move.
Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect.
There are straps in back.
What was that?
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Fuck off!
You told me to get you up, asshole.
Hasta la vista, Boone. And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
Good. Fine.
I just want to watch it, okay?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Hanna.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You didn't, Jimmy.
Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean. Your reputation.
But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Then who did?
All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
More your line.
Boris? Do I look a fright?
Elsa?
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a few minutes.
Of course.
What's our pesky friend up to now?
Oh dear.
Good-bye. So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Don't be daft. It's just a student from the university.
Yes?
Luminal.
No. Let me lie here. Thank you.
My mind's lovely. And yours?
Just go. We can manage without you.
Go.
Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
Good night.
Of course. This afternoon.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No. But someone you can talk to.
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course. How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room. I will look.
I know. People's movies aren't their lives.
Sure.
After you then.
Everything. Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
No. I never said you were. Or will be soon.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I guess.
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Of course.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto. Let me see.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio.
Head. Not heart.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Right.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
Don't go away.
Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid. Now that I know you're around.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.
Is there someplace we can talk?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Six years ...
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
Jesus ...
The business has changed...

Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Point-five ...
Yes ... Kip ...
I don't want him hurt...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that, too --
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
One more night --
Get out --
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Right there -
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You got no choice. It's over.
How is he?
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?

Kip.
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Your girl works in there ...

Double-meaning intended --

Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
Right ...
The other day....
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Not at all ...
Keys were in it ...
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
Good.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Yeah?
C'mon, man ...
We're partners here --
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!

Peugot convertible ...

Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?

I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
It's arright ...
Yeah...
one minute -- !
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
That's a good one, Donny...
I think so too --
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
We don't -- ?
Remember who my brother is?
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
How's Kip?
No.

Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Of course ...
What time of year?
Tuesdays ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.

We'll take it.
What do you say, Toby?,
I'm cool -
Yeah... You want a ride...
Sure -
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Don't go there, Toby --
I dunno ...
What am I supposed to do?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
You, too
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Sure --
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Yeah --
Okay --
What do you got ... ?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
About what?
"About what?"
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can see that -
What?
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
Me...
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
Shadow games ...
De nada ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
I'm cool.
Nah.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
I don't know. What -- ?
What?
Come here -
What?
Come here -
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Toby...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Move over ...
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Sure, man --
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
I gotta get my tool --
Now, we go -
Run it...
Hospital.
We can't do that, dude --
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
We're going shopping -- !
For real?
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Call 'em here -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
What are you doing here?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
You look like you lost your sheep ...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Mitch.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of me.
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And here I am...
Six or seven...
What's wrong with her -- ?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
Very good...
No ... ?
No ...
Oh, yeah.
No. Open her ...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Deodorant.
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
I take out my slim-jim...
Oh, God...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I do ... I cut "em...
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
No worries ...
How is he -- ?
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Yeah ... You -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
What's that?
Bench seats.
You remember Junie?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
He's gotten involved --
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Tell me...
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
She left...
I'll see you soon --
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She soars -
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
How come ... ?
Not really -
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Not --
Excuse me --
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Checkin' it out
Shit all looks the same here --
What? What happened?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
No more shines, Billy.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
What?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Wha? Me?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Anybody! You understand?
I understand.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You treated me like shit.
Liar!
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What are you gonna do?
Get inside!
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
How much?
That again.
What's the matter with you? You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Jezuz Christ!
Let her carry this shit inside.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Never.
With what?
She's beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Hello! Hello! Have a good flight?
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
I got scared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
Jimmy.
We did it. We did it.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
So what? Where are they gonna go?
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Nah.
I better call again.
How?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
Yeah.
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Will you stop.
He heard.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You're some fucking jerk.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Yeah.
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat. I won't go without it.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy. Come on. Relax.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
So do I.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
I got dry cleaning.
We'll pick it up.
I don't want them left back.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
That's important.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Please?
Yeah.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home...
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Least I work for a livin'. Why'd you get fired?
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
All right, then.
Watch what happens.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Stop crowdin the plate!
What are we gonna do up there?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids. You'd prob'ly fit right in.
We're not goin'. I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Next week.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
You're fuckin' good.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
I don't know.
Gone.
What?
She went to Medical school in California.
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
Yah, it's not a bad school...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
How you doin'?
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
Yeah, it is.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Fuck her.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
I told you "no" yesterday!
I'm Irish.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Oh, Morgan.
Shut the fuck up.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Retainer...
You want us to give you cash right now?
I have about seventy-three...
Will you take a check?
History.
How'd you like that course?
Good, it was all right.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Seven.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
It's touching me.
Down there. And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
The limit is not found! The limit is not found.
--But--
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
Building two.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
What're those?
That you meet with me twice a week--
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
I think so.
I happen to know so.
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
An integer.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
That's enough.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I don't know what it's called.
It's right. Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Bullshit.
I appreciate that.
Yes.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Find out what?
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Yeah, cured polio.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
I did.
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I've been busy.
You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
That would be fine.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
Tom.
You too, Gerry.
Not at all.
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
What don't I understand?
Who?
I do.
Well, you're the only one.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Where're you going?
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
About thirty million to one.
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
He was my roommate in college.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I go places, I interact.
What places?
Certain, clubs. Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
What?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Probably not.
How about the ones on that shelf?
What did you think?
That must have taken you a long time.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
285.
Oh.
No.
Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
What is?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Watch your mouth.
Time's up.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been out of Boston.
No.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
How'd it go?
Fine.
Well, are you going out again?
I don't know.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
They could see that I meant it.
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I don't know.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
What did you think?
What did I think?
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't want the job.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
What?
No. Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Yes.
It sure ain't good.
I used to go with the wrench.
The wrench, why?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done?
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
What?
Here's my number.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Okay, sounds good.
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
Sure.
Okay...
No.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No I haven't...
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What, five?
Not a chance.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
Your house must have been a zoo.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Do you know all their names?
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Well...
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
If you bring the caramels.
How the hell did you do that?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
No.
Then let's go have some fun.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
When?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Not tonight.
Fine.
Want me to take a look?
No.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
It's important that I learn this.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Like me?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why not?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
At least you have a mother.
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Yes, I do, Will.
I love you, Will. No take-backs.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
How 'bout you?
Sure. Why not?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You're *ticklin' me!*
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Now I can't breathe.
Naw. They paroled me.
Oh.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
She got to make it.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Short fella. Pale face.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
I didn't see nothin'.
Okay. Go on.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Deputy sheriffs.
Got a warrant?
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
How many of you?
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare! I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
Been out travelin' around?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years.
Excuse me for asking.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
They never wrote you nothing?
No. They wasn't people to write.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
What you figger to do?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I don't know.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Thought you was in jail.
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Women is always tar'd.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Save your strength, lady. Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Lissen, I heard that before--
Want to work, do you?
Sure do.
Pull up behind that car. Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Can't you see that sticker?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.
Get to what?
Naw--not much!
I stay in my own yard.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
I didn't mean nothing.
That's where I get off.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
What you mean?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Hush!
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Yes, ma'am.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
Take her with you!
California.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Sure. We aim to.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
Stand by the door.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
She'll be awright.
Sometimes they do.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
I'm ready.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
That's right. And douse some in it.
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
Thank God! An' we're still together-- most of us.
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
When?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
Looks like you done it.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know what--this fella looks like?
They know he got hit in the face.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Me neither. It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.
Sure. Good-by.
Good-by, Tommy.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
There, them stripy ones.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Won't they come out here?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
California, here we come!
Give 'im a fryin' pan.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
We gonna take whatever they got.
But what about this?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
You do not see either!--not yet!
I wisht it was day.
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Whatsa matter?
It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
Won't they ketch us?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
I won't-- --if you won't tell what *I* done!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
What's this?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I never--
Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You do not.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--Stop it--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
--No.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
Wonderful.
So, what are you doing now?
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
What?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
Okay. See you later.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
Really?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
Insane.
To make a long story short...
Overflowing with love.
Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Correct. That's for you. Keep it.
It's nice to see you again.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Okay.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
You see someone?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Yep.
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
That'd be good.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
What?
No time.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Yes.
Not the other way around...?
No.
Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Come on.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
I just know.
Say more.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Mmm.
Morality.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Out Loud?
This is me breating.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Do you like the people you work with?
I work alone.
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Thank you, no.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Hard to get good help these days.
Okay.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Nope.
I guess.
In Portugal, yes.
I don't think so.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Wait a minute--
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
If he does our job, he's our job.
I get it.
No...
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Patch him through....
This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
I'll pay.
I'm not happy.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Never enough.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Jim?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
Of course you will.
Yeah...
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Paul?
You're leaving me hanging here...
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
No.
He sold me this bad boy.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Mein Dealer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
As long as you had a good time.
That's too bad.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Work's good for the soul.
See you in ten years.
How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Wow.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How are you? How's business?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
That's good.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
It is cocktail hour yet?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You sleeping all right in that house?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
You too.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
OK. I'll stop talking then.
Feel good?
Yeah.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
OK.
Five years. My son was born here.
Son?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Ever think of moving there full time?
I am comfortable.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Huh?
Tom.
What?!
I won't ask you to.
Annie!
One more time.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Why?
The point was to love each other.
Why?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Okay.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
It's still early. What's your next class?
I brought it to you in the hospital.
No, you didn't.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Doesn't matter.
What about him?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
I don't care.
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Fine.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
You don't.
I don't care.
I don't care.
What?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
That's not true!
Then why do you want to leave?
Little.
Don't they believe in signs here?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
I didn't see it.
I think they call it a pasture.
You already did.
Did he mention it?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
No. I just thought... forget it.
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You're right. Good.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks, honey.
Did you go riding?
About what?
Well... So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
What are you talking about?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I said... I started.
My period.
When? Tonight?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?... Oh baby...
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Tom's gone.
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Hi.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Exactly...
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Riding with Judith.
Yeah. Bye.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, let me go.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
The funeral's on Friday.
Okay.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
How's my pregnant chick!
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
Doing what?
Yeah.
What did he say?
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Night.
Everything all right.
Huh-huh. You?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I wish I did.
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Let's not talk about that now.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
You want to take a walk with me?
Where to?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
What was it like?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise?
Promise.
You too, Diane.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Well, of course, right...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
What?
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
No thanks.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
Yeah.
We should be fine, then.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You know, you're a good kid.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
You're catching on.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
It's never too soon to start.
I don't have all day.
Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I thought your mom's coming up?
So?
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
No, not yet.
How's Pilgrim doing?
OK, OK.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Maybe... look -- just...
NO!
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
WAS SO!
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
We still have a way to go.
How much longer do you think?
I understand...
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
How long were you married?
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
What stuff is that?
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Don't move!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Hack the Planet!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
What is it with this guy?
Shh!
Was that her top?
The sensitive type.
Again? Yeah sure.
I want it.
Super hero like even.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
...as they snoop onto us.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
It was him, man!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I'm gonna hit you!
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the lights.
Difficulty rating?
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Roger.
Curtis.
And what's he do?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
No, don't know who he is. Do you?
Dead?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Mm-hmm.
Up all night again, huh?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?!
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
No. No one special.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Blow me.
Thank you!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Give it up! Just give it up.
This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
No.
What's going on?
Razor and Blade.
How did you know that?
I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa!
Burn!
What's this one eat?
It nibbles. You see this?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
What?
I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
What?
I didn't know what was on it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I'll make it up to you!
How?
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's my subway defense system.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
Thanks for your help.
Yeah.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
Dreams?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
Homicidal?
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
I think we've got something.
We caught 'em.
Good.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
Cancer?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
Virus?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Pervert! What are you talking about?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
What number please?
555-4202.
Just one moment.
Thank you.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.
Yeah. Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
All right.
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
This morning.
I'm not angry it's just
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So?
I don't know Brady.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
You don't owe me anything.
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Not without Jamie.
Look.
She's not dead!
I don't know!
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Get back!
Brady!
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
It's okay..it's okay.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink Rachel?
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We should call the fire department.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
You know damn well about what. You let them take it out of here.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.
How many bodies did you find?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
Ready to go. Who signs for him?
I do.
Outside.
Check him out.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Yeah. Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
No way. No how.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
It's been eleven months.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I don't want to.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
You bet.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
What?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
Coming.
I thought you said you were ready.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh Rachel!
No.
Come on.
I can't.
Well try dammit!
I've got you come on, go down.
Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
No.
Dad, what's going on?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
Just do it.
All right.
Hi.
You knew. You just didn't care.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Hi Jamie.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Okay, bye.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Do you?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Go get it.
What are we doing?
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
How do you know?
Least I'm not alone.
Yes.
Dear God.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Evil.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Be here in a minute.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Car trouble?
Sort of.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
What's going on?
Now you understand?
Uh huh.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You blame everything on kids.
Huh?
He shouts, too.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
That's not true. Here I am.
We just talked.
Sure.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Cute.
Okay. Bye.
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I've already lost it.
Bye.
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
That's probably all he can do.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Yes, you can.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Here, Lester.
No, he's not.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't know.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
I don't want to.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I want to stay here and watch this.
Come with me.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
And I can't keep you interested?
Just answer the damn phone.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
YEAH?
Are you sure?
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
It's important.
I'll be here.
Could have...
He isn't a man.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
You all right?
Sure...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
I found the car! He's here!
Where?
TOTALLY!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
I don't think so...
Totally.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
See you.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
I promise.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
I saw him...
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
HURRY!
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
No! Do as I say.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Yes, she is.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Okay.
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
I couldn't if I tried.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Oh, listen...
Mmm?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I can't believe it!
I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Well, let's hope so.
Oh.
Are you really interested?
Yeah.
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
Great.
Look at this.
A lot of works.
Uh --
And then, uh, April...huh?
Great.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Mmm.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
Yeah.
It feels like you're in France.
...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
It's really terrible.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Well, wait. You know what? I know.
Uh...
I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
What?
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
And you, you-you're going?
Right.
Hmm?
Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.
Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Really? Is the food that bad?
Oh no. Not at all.
Ah! HOLLY Now.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
What time do you get off?
It's terrific!
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Fast.
Well...
Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Let's take a look.
When did you first notice this?
Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have?
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
It's nothing. Will you trust me?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
Yeah?
Well, are...are they big?
Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
Read the papers! Half the country's doing it!
Yes, but you name names.
We nev-- We don't name names! We say the Pope.
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Oh. Well, I live--
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Oh, God.
I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
Yeah, you would.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yeah, sure.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
No! No...
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Everything's okay?
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
No, I don't think so.
Well, sure.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, yeah.
But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you.
What are you doing?!
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But not over me?
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
No.
Is something wrong?
Oh, not here. There are too many people around.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
I know! I know!
No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
Mmm.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot.
I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
You're not lost.
Get his wine away.
This is a toast. You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
I am glad to see you.
Always.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
How can we be happy?
But why? We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Of what? I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
No, thank you.
No, nothing.
Absolutely.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
Mmm...
Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
Me?
Yeah.
Based on what? You never even see him.
They're in the basement.
Oh, Frederick!
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I can't take this anymore.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
You've been with someone!
Stop accusing me!
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
Yeah.
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
But who? Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh...
You know...
Yeah?
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
Like--
Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Like what?! What?
I don't know. Cancer, I--
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here.
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
No.
Yes!
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I think they're fantastic.
You've outdone yourself.
Okay.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...
Why?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
Y-yeah.
Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly. Stop it.
Oh, now--
She's going through a really rough time right now.
I think we need to eat.
Yeah. I'll get some ice.
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
Very good.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Huh?
Everything's good. Everything's fine.
Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Here, you guys. Open them up.
He's fine.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think so.
I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
Yeah.
The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I know, I know.
...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person...
That's really nice!
...you know? I, uh...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Oh!
Go right over there.
Football!
Wow!
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself?
I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you talking about?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
What, by a st-stranger?
Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger? With a--
Just think about it. That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, okay.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
True.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know. H-how much do you need?
Two thousand dollars.
Yeah.
Okay.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here. Be careful with those.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Oh!
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh-oh. HOLLY ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic.
Oooo.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh...
No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
I know, no-- I know.
Uh-huh.
Easily.
I hope.
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Look, everything's going your way.
Well, I just came from an audition...
So what's new?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, what do they know?
You got it.
How?
You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
You're too demanding.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter?
Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, so loosely.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
Well--
Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can't hear anything.
You want some?
No!
My--uh...
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Yeah. Me, too.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Right. Yeah. I had a...
God!
...I had a great time tonight, really. It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, really. You do. You do.
Yeah?
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, it was.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
People change...you know.
Well, I hope you've changed.
...namely a personality.
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much. You know...
Well...
...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Have you?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
No, I am. I am.
Really?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, I haven't.
You have.
You're kidding me.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But--
I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
What...what about your script? So what's it about?
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Yeah.
Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Well, what about me?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous.
Oh!
Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed.
I am. You-you made my day.
Oh, wow!
It's all right.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault. I--
Hi.
Hi. How you doin'?
Okay.
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Oh. You look so beautiful.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
Mm-hm.
God.
Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
Where are the antihistamines?
Oh...
Dad!
...which I did not get.
April?
Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Uh-huh.
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay. Thank you very much.
You're welcome. Hare Krishna.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...I was <u>working</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Yes? My <u>promotion</u>...?
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience.
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
...you...
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..." Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Who would that be.
Oh, yes. He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
Hey, I'm fine. Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You're ready now.
I'm not.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I feel... I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
And who is "they?"
...they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're...
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...these guy'll back you up.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
He had nothing. He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Their family owns...
Impossible.
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
That's why my wife adores me.
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.
Seen what, sir..?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Show me the Pigs.
Have the child taken to bed.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No. And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes. You know I will. That's right.
Awright.
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am. It's just something he does.
I won't take much of his time.
He's glad to help. ...it's just a question of his physical condition. You Understand...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction. To his appearance.
What reaction?
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.
I can make you rich.
And I expect you to. Let's talk like two medical men
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
...unmarked hundreds....
....what...?
Let the girl go.
Why?
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own. I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>. They botched the fallback plan, they...
He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
No.
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>? There ain't nobody there...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
You nervous...?
Said what?
I'm an orphan.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
A wonderful country...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
That, that was <u>business</u>...
Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'll have them picked up.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?--
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
My scar is a war-wound.
How so?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.
How could you know?
Enchante.
Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a pleasure.
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Back to <u>America</u>...? When first we met you'd just returned from America.
I require...
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
She's not the first foster that you've had. <u>Is</u> she?
No.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long. They die.
Oh, no, no. It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Thank you, that's not responsive. How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Thank you. No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...? Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.
You're <u>free</u>...
...which of us is free...?
...what has she done to harm you...?
Well. <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
That's what I should do. Tell me why?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>!
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What do you want to do? You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself?
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you. Why dontcha gimme the gun?
...<u>what</u>...?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Fine, thank you, but
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
We are here on sufferance. I am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...they asked us to dinner. How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...get me a cigarette.
...what did you want?
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you. What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
...but: this particular statue...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
Brazilian.
It would seem.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
"A liaison position with the Opera."
I can't remember. I've got to make some money.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
..and <u>humiliation</u>? What is this new job they've...?
No. That's right. That's all part of it.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know. Do <u>you</u> know...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her. To appeal to her, and you feel that...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
Your father. It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Well, no... That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
What's wrong with approval? You admired that man.
Yes.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
...yes...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Yes.
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And. I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
...yes...?
But they were not there. <u>Yesterday</u>. Is that called a Delusion...?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Did you wait until you were 18?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Wha-at? What is it?
Everything.
This is...this is...a very special moment...
What are you gonna do about it?
You guys have been so colossal...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight.
That would be a No.
That wants to be a Yes.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Nothing.
Why do you even like me?
Uh-huh.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh that's right, you can't.
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
That's not what I was worried about.
Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Talking while kissing.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Probably.
It's been known to happen.
Do you really think I care?
What do you want me to say?
Something more interesting than that...How could you? How could--!
Thank you, my love. ]
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Don't get cocky, girl.
Shoot.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Gee, thanks.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey, don't run away now.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Like last night, Veronica?
You did last night.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
Oh yeah, that's it.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Uh-huh.
Don't think.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Geez, don't listen to them.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You goddamn bitch!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
King David.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yeah, maybe.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
Oh shit, yeah.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
Give it up girl!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Suicide is a private thing.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Sure.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I don't really like your friends either.
S'okay....
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
Killing her won't solve anything.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Chick-en.
You're not funny.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
And your worst enemy.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
That's good. Have you done this before?
Next channel, darling.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
French.
Incredible similarity.
Oh.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Remember he's left-handed.
Of course.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
No-o!
What?
I thought I...you..
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Let's kick his ass.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Pretty weird.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
I think so, man.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Punch it in!
I guess.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
May<u>be</u>.
Superb.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But my name's not...
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
What's that?
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Look who I've found!
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
breaks down into heavy sobs.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Bye.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
What does old Stew want?
Open this door!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
stands and walks toward the door.
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
hurries over.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Saint Mario!
He . . .
Him . . .
This . . .
That . . .
God, yes!
It's so beautiful!
What???
You're such an incredible woman.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go overseas . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Yes . . .
I know what to do about mother.
Mummy!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Your wife...?
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I'm all over it.
The way you just looked at me...
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
All finished.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Bull...
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I did more then that.
Well?
No.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Just get better okay?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Since what?
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
I quit. Today's my last day.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Someone special.
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Uh... eighty two?
Eighty four.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
What?
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
What?
Never to put you in my will.
Really? Why?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
I only married you for your body.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Where's my wife?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
No please make yourself at home.
We're all here for you Trevor.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't work here.
Music to my ears.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Hey buddy!
Who the hell are you talking to?
Ambulance.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Two.
Can you follow them?
Wow you are out of it.
This game is over do you hear me?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
What do you mean?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.
YOU!
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Really?
It's getting hot in here.
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Try stupid.
One leg! Like the Red Cross or something?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
LaPlante!
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
In private. They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
The bathroom! For two days?
Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here.
You should go in. You're risking your life again...
Right.
Huh? Whadda you mean?
Bernie. Call me Bernie.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie. Almost half.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
Bail, for Chrissake! I'm innocent!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope. You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Often, uh.
How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff. You are naive.
Spanish kinda guys!
Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know. Those guys been in here?

He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Camera, Chucky. Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir? What is your relationship with John Bubber?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
"The Nomm"? What's that?
It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter.
Were you in it? In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase.
I'm working on that. It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Thanks. Thanks, pal.
JOEY!
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
...unworthy of the adoration. We all do.
You... you think I saved your... life. I can't take advantage....
No, I don't have the right. You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Uh, right. A... news story.
Goodnight, John.
A script! I thought we just walked through everything...
Read it. It'll be fine.
There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can support me anytime, John.
Gale...
I just remembered. You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Bodybuilding!
You do?
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This sofa is a lethal weapon. The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
LaPlante!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!" "Not a passenger." Who?
WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT?
He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
A Silver Mike! You're covering us in glory!
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
She can't quit.
What?
The Presidency. The public loves him.
Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.
The "unknown hero." They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
You were in bed. Weren't you?
I... I saw him out the window.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
Never reach out!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
You didn't?
He's pretty... remarkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
I didn't ask him.
Call him back. Ask him. I'm a little...busy.
They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding.
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV.
What toys do you have?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
A sense of proportion.
I should.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Right.
Because life isn't about playing it safe. Life is about taking risks.
Sure.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
I bet. Going into people's homes.
It's a living.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You must value your independence.
What happened?
Can I tell you tomorrow? I think I...
I think we should talk first.
About us.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Bye, Neil!
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
A man scared me.
A man? Was it a dream?
Uh huh.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Did Daddy tease you?
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Holly -- that's not so.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
He'll never appreciate it more.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
RUDOLF!
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
He's staying with a friend. Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey --
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
That's okay, Mom.
What?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end? Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job. Come on.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
Damn.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
<u>No</u>. If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
No.
There's no card or anything.
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
What next?! -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Fuck you, Philip.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Yeah -- she did a good job. This glass looks brand-new.
Philip! The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
C'mon.
He wasn't there.
What?
There might be some extras in the garage.
Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates me.
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I think it's time I came home now.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Yeah -- we know him. He's been hanging around the house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long. There have been a couple of bids already.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Isn't it?
Oh, space! -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Put it out, man!
Do you have enough money?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What about cable?
I didn't.
Rudolf? C'mere, Rudolf!
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
-- A man.
No.
No man! <u>Go to your room</u>.
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah? Where's the bed?
Right over here.
It's a double.
Even better.
Even cosier.
Promise.
Would you?
Uh huh.
Really.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Parker. We found him knocked out in the can.
Not now. I'm busy.
What? Who are you? What do you want?
They appear to be authentic.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Yes.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
I'd like you to see this.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
This ties in with Nash.
We don't have any proof of that.
I don't need proof. I know it. Send it out.
I think it was England.
Why?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
What?
Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
That's what I figured. Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
I already told you. I took a walk.
Tell me again. Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No. I don't scare easy.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Around.
And Brenda?
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
No.
No.
You sure?
Is that it?
Get outta here.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Aye.
No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.
We too are brothers, Macleod. In fact, you have more family than you think.
What?
Sing.
It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Are you always this pleasant? You know what you're problem is?
You?
What else? What else do you hear right now?
That's all?
Yes.
I see. You don't care about life anymore.
Leaving what?
England. There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.
Then it's worth the journey.
For what?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to?
France.
How long is the voyage?
Not long. We should arrive in the morning. Are you going to be alright?
Living. Remember?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
She's the King's cousin.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
What worries you?
You.
The only thing you can do. You must end it.
It's done.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
You always get to go first.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
I would like to say goodbye.
How?
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Your life.
How?
I lied.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
The past?
Sometimes.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Why not?
I'm leaving in the morning.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
Huge.
What are you hoping to find inside?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries. It's a syndicated show out of..
I remember you.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Are you a cop?
No. I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
A lucky guess.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
If it's good advice.
This is. Go home. Stay out of this.
Why? What's going on?
I'll be fine.
What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
Jennifer.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
I'm interested in mythology.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
I told you I'm interested in mythology. We can talk about it more.
You're twenty minutes late.
Sorry.
I know.
Why?
I've lived all over the world.
Why? Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.
A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.
Is it?
Yes -- it is.
Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan. Do you know who they are?
Why don't you tell me.
No.
Why not?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
You don't really believe this do you?
--for three hundred years.
How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.
Not unless they're immortal.
I've seen it.
On the back it has--
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
How did you know that?
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He will not stop until it is over.
Get out.
Conner?
Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
What? How?
I don't know.
What's that next to him?
His head. Someone cut it off.
It has to be.
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I know, Paul.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
We'll see.
It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
This cannot be.
That's what the Kurgan said.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
Why did you wait?
I know.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I can take care of myself.
No.
How can that be?
I don't know.
No -- I'm fine. Thank you.
Me too.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
I love you, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I'll no forget you.
And I you. Go now. Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Yes.
I shouldn't have come back here. It was a mistake.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Fine.
What will you do?
Why?
I don't know. He is the stronger one. He has a power--
You also have a power, Conner. It is why you have survived.
My dreams died long ago.
Good afternoon... ... Shirley.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
No. The money, please.
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry. I'm three feet away.
Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief. Absolutely.
Get to work.
It's me, Chief. Can you talk?
It was stolen.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Keep trying.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
The best.
I want a message sent: No fuckups allowed.
I'll make the call.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
<u>Fuck</u> them! Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
I guess not.
I guess not, too. How much information is in the house?
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Am I talkin' raghead?! I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
I'm going to my desk.
You're not goin' anywhere! Get on the fuckin' floor!
I have contacts in Los Angeles. Lawyers and judges who can help you.
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up! Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
I didn't know he would have a gun! It just went off!
Shut up, goddamnit! Just calm down!
What if he's dead? What if you killed him?
We're on foot. We can't get away.
Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We should give up. All we're doing is making it worse.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
It's about Mars --
Bullshit. Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis! I <u>saw</u>! It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Are you totally stupid? What does it look like?
Jesus, first Mars, now you. You two need anti-depressants.
That's why we tied him, dumbass. Now come here and see this --
Not if they're looking at something else.
Like what?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
There is no way out.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>! Help me celebrate! I figured it out!
Celebrate what? Going to prison?
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck it's over. That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department. Look out the window. You see the car?
We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him.
Fuck you. I'm running this shit. You talk to me.
How about the cop?
Dennis? I want you to release those people.
Fuck that. They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down! I got gasoline all over in here!
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis. They won't give you a helicopter.
I'll give you these people.
What?
I gotta piss real bad.
The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that! You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.
Maybe that's what I'm doing. Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Give up.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million. I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis. Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
My father.
Shut up and sit down. You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV. <u>Look</u> at him.
Use more ice.
I'm getting a doctor!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him! I think he's dying!
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before. That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We're rich.
We're trapped in a house.
You can't run with suitcases.
Find something: Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I got the gasoline --
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave.
Fuckin' A.
I overheard him with the girl.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out! If he took those kids, we're fucked!
That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
You have his address?
Pretty sure I do. Yeah, here we go --
It won't be a problem.
He has a wife and kid. That's how we'll get to him.
Okey-doke.
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
Give me an ETA.
An hour, tops. Might be sooner.
What do you mean?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
Canyon Country.
I think you got no choice.
Yeah.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You said they would be here!
Close.
First my girls. I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You're hiding, Jeffrey. You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I still see that boy's eyes.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet. Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm in no rush. Maybe later we can talk.
That's okay. I love you anyway.
Be quiet! Listen!
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs. Then we can run for it.
You go, Thomas. You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Go! If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
Shh, they'll hear you!
Better than you getting killed! Don't touch that gun! Daddy says --
I know.
I don't drink beer.
Mommy won't know. You can do anything you want right now. Mommy won't know.
We can't make the microwave work.
We're hungry. You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Stop it.
Mars? What are you doing?
Whatever.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
He's just knocked out. I've been knocked out.
Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
He said something about a girl --
Holster your guns!
What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.
Get in the car. <u>Now</u>.
What are you doing?! Stop that!
Just one question. Please.
He. Can't. Answer.
I need to talk to him. Alone.
Another minute. Please --
Three white males shot Junior. Mike followed them to York Estates --
Where are they?
York Estates. Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief? Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me. She's at the little Thai place.
I know the one.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Go.
I couldn't find Jane. She wasn't at the restaurant.
You have her cell number?
She didn't answer.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
What's wrong with the radio?
Other people can hear us. Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Stand by.
Laura Martin. This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Jesus. He must've siphoned it from the cars.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras. Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Then I think we should wait. Do you agree?
And now I'm taking it back. We're getting Smith out of the house.
I'm looking for you. I need your tactical unit.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?
It's right in front of us.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
Are all of you named Jones?
Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it.
What?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up. I'll handle the Sheriffs.
Not until the man calls.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath! He <u>kills</u> people!
They've been in there all day.
Where's the office?
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
In my room.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall.
I opened Marlon. I think it's somebody's taxes.
Look for names. Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al. See if you can open Al.
Who is it?
Charles G. Benza. They're coming!
No! They're right here --
They're still in the house.
Yes.
Then you have everything. You can put them away.
A man has my family. Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell. He was on his way for the disks.
How do I reach him?
I'm the Chief. I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang. We won't go far.
What do you want?
Smith will know.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
I guess we do.
My people are good to go. You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.
We're almost home, you and me. Keep your shit together. This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
We, who is we?
A delegation.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Cockroaches?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Excuse me?
Of course.
I'll be back.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
We are looking for you.
Let me see your identity card.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
Let me explain.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
I don't have that much.
Six.
And four children?
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I don't understand.
They're only taking the whites.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't, I don't have the men.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Well rewarded Those were his words.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
The front gate would be best, General.
You said you had no whiskey.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I'll be over.
Bring back your policemen...
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
Today.
No.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
At least.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Great. No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Fuck you.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Of course.
Very soon.
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Promoted. House Manager.
Good for you. We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Call, sir?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
I will remember that name. Let's go.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
You have our cards.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need a great favor.
Of course.
Move? Where to?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Of course.
Homework?
What?
We must do something.
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
Murdered! By whom?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Get in.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
It will do just fine.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
I'll try.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
We have been abandoned.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Go out! Where?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
No, no.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
A kiss.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Yes.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
What?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Why?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
A car.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No.
No! Sit down now.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of everything.
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
I have to go to the Diplomat.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
You have taken business class?
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
How much beer?
Many beers.
When?
As the trucks go.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Who is this Simon?
Where?
On the street.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
I'm confused.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
And what's Steven's status?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
More to the point. Where's our host?
Yeah...something.
C'mon.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
-- I'm sure you did.
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
Excuse me?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
I don't know!!
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
As a tumor.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
Left, goddamnit!
Yes.
The...Fourth of July.
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Up here --
Over here!
Take the gun.
Prove it.
Prove it how?
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
I'm better than that.
Don't push it.
Why?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Most fun I've had all day.
You need to get out more.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I don't think so...
Why not?
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
No...not air --
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
And then where are we?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Back where?
Let's try down here...
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Better living through electricity.
That's crazy!
What about that other guy?
It'll have to do.
He's gotta still be down here.
He's dead...?
We're safe?
-- was that??
For chrissake give me a hand!
It's succeeding!
Run.
What --
I don't do groups.
Jesus!
So where's the party?
I hope not.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
You're hurting me.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- in the act.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Where is she?
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
Question answered.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
Steven??
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
No, no, it's just --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
What?
And here's your goddamn severance!
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
My wife. Where were we?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
And then what happens?
I think it's something better experienced then described.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Maybe if I --
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- my loss --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
What?
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
I am.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
-- no more --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
Rewind that.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Why not?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?
He would have been back by now.
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa...?
For the love of God....please...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Sara...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
You say you saw some activity here?
What's the matter?
These records only go back to 1880. But... ...wait a minute...
Colleen.
It might have been her mother.
We don't have proof of that.
Suppose not.
What will they tell you?
So was I. The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
No!
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
By freeing them.
I don't understand.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Sure.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
Who...is Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
She talks to me.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Ok...
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
Go to your room! Now!
What do you mean? Mommy? You're scaring me!
I'm ok mommy.
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
Take me to her.
My God, I heard something!
Sure. Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
Ok. If you want this room, you can have it.
He's blessing the house.
Why?
For good luck honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
That's great, honey.
Fight it back Aubrey. Fight it back as hard as you can!
Don't be afraid!
Daddy, please!!!
Daddy help!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
The place is pretty dusty.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What?
It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you.
I don't know. That's strange.
She's asleep. I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Ok.
Were you fooling with the power?
No.
It was in the cellar. Weird.
So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Who?
I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
What about keeping an open mind?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
She has a...friend. Colleen.
A friend?
You, an imaginary friend. That's what she calls her.
I think everything's ready.
Good. I'll start bringing things in.
She's gone!
Aubrey?! Aubrey?!
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Ok...
Know what?
What?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What are you talking about?
We're not going.
Not going! Are you out of your mind?! Wait!
No... NO!
What's happening!
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
She's at school. We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
Oh, that's nice...
May I come in?
Did you know her very well?
What!
Why?
Aubrey? It's mommy.
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
And you...are?
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer, But I really have to go.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Good night.
The amulet...
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
It will not take long...
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
What's going to happen?
Yes, they are.
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Not really. Oh, wait a minute.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Runic?
Not at all, if it can help.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
I don't know! Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
I know what I saw.
And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story.
No. Not on station time. My story. My time.
Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place.
And why are you back? Why are we here?
Your apartment.
The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
It's nothing to do with me. I wasn't even with him.
Where?
Under the Underground? What's that? Where is ...
Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Joey. Yeah, who is this?
Right. Right!
Right.
Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh yeah ...
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
It's okay. It's just someone burned me once.
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
I'll do it!
The bank owns it. But I'm working on it.
Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys.
No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
Sure. Why?
It's Saturday morning. Let's go shopping.
Yeah. Happening, isn't it?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Oh, Terri ...
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Here! Here! Pull over!
God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.
No. We want ...
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business. I ...
It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.
Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
I don't know. Maybe.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Uh-huh.
And this is your club. Great club. I really love it here. Great club.
Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That's ... really nice.
It's yours. You won it. It's a prize.
A prize? For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman? I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
I'm sorry.
Wow. Thank you.
No. Thank you.
Unh-unh.
Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out.
You shit. Who do you think you are?
Good. So did I. And that's all ...
But how in God's name ...
It has already begun.
Not quite.
JP?
Live and in the flesh. How're you doing, babe?
What do you want?
Will you relax? Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah really. I'm ...
C'mon. It'll be great.
Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It was so beautiful! When the blanks went off, they...
I laughed, I cried.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Don't say it, Hawkins. I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness." Swear to God... tubby.
Show off. Hey, boss tune. "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Sure. That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
You're not...LISTENING!
Don't wet your diapers. I'll have to change them. "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
No need. Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
5:32. "Swinging on a Star."
You know they invented something while you were inside. Called a watch.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
Why try?
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
But I said I was sorry....
Damn travel agency. That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Why not just go now?
Okay.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
You can be lookout!..... Take Alex's gun.
"But we'll be the same as we started...
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight. I lost ten pounds in Rome
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Get em....
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
You're unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her plan is over.
George, you promised. No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
You're supposed to be dead!
I betrayed a man. A good man. An innocent man. A thief.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Sorry. Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
God go with you, sister.
Fantastic. Perfection. The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Nice. But right out of our brochure.
Oh, you read that.
Actually I wrote it. It's a good sentence. It can apply to people.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I never break a date. Scout's honor.
Prison?
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Oh. No.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Oh. Well, what's this?
Trust Leonardo....
Wha.....
Actually he never told us what it was.
Baseball, why?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Like a "cat", one could say.
I don't care.
So let's get busy. Have some fun and make some deals.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?
Million five, lover...
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Uh, yeah. Cut to the chase.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing. Don't touch me....
When it rains, it pours. Name's Snickers. The plane leaves in 40.
Bastard! If you were a true American.
Just shut up and hit me!
Hush. My employer wants a meeting.
Employer? The president?
No, somebody powerful. Oh. Look. what's that up there?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Shucks. Guess not.
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
The Jerky Circle!
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
He didn't look unhappy!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Okay, Miss Archuh. ...I got gears to see to.
I'm plenty happy!
Adenoids?
Lumbago.
Yeah.
A sawbuck!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
On Norville Barnes!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
The couch, please.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Please! Norville!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...I'm sorry.
...You do?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Sure, Norville, sure...
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Never mind about that...
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
You mean you know about this?
Consider this my resignation --
Norville!
Huh?!
Oh Norville, I --
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez who?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
He grins wolfishly.
Terrific.
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Forty-eight years...
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Well, I --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Huh?! But, buddy --
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy --
An example must be made!
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Get up!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
...It is?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
But Buzz --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Sir?
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Yes sir...
Yeah?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
I --
I --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
Hmmm.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or... ...'schmoe'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
You're fired.
But, sir! --
Get your feet off that desk.
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
Fah from it...
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She's looking for her mark.
She sits down.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff-up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma. They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
No. She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.
If you say, miss. If you say.
I'm afraid so.
Ti-Joseph?
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
A missionary's widow? It isn't very likely, is it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
But, Mrs. Rand --
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Thank you.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
My brother's wife.
I went to school in Buffalo. Paul went to school in England.
Mr. Holland?
It'll wait.
It's my day off.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Did you hear what he sang?
Of course, Wes.
But she's not dead, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes, thank you.
No, thank you. Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
A woman crying? No one's been crying here.
I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I often do.
Didn't I? I don't know. That's the simple truth of it. I don't know.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I imagined this so differently...
Help me? How?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort. I thought they might cure her.
I hated her.
Yes.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
Foolish? Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell them what you saw there.
Got a meeting uptown.
Right o'.
Up the organization! Bastard.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
No thank you. We should be off.
Gotcha.
I wasn't star--
So maybe you'll come too?
Good night.
You want to go?
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
Rough day. Good night.
Hmm. Good night.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Um, yes.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
That shirt?
What?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
See for yourself.
No advice from the experts, huh?
You think I --
I have no idea.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Don't be dim.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
It's a starting place.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
I'm not.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
We'll talk in the morning.
The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Anyone special? You know...
Hnnn.
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Yeah?
Gotcha.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
In a bit.
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What are you talking about?
What?
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Good night kiddo.
Nah.
What you been up to?
Nothing.
Jesus all right enough!
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Yeah.
C'mon.
That's besides the point.
But what?
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
A key party?
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Yeah. You?
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Hi Wendy.
With Mikey?
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
We were just riding around.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I suppose. Why?
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
I insist. Don't touch them.
It's really quite all right.
Of course.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's not like we're too busy.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Educated guess.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Yes.
No need to make excuses --
Forget what?
Forget how to ride a bike.
That's right.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Ouch.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
See ya.
Where you going?
Do what?
What?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
Am I right or am I right?
Shit. You're not planning --
All will be revealed, baby.
Moisture! Moisture!
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
One for you and one for me.
Major.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Groovy. Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter? And what's that?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
No!
Play with the whip.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Great, thanks for the tip.
The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
What is it?
Thanks for the advice dad.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
My what?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
Who said so?
No one.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah?
Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Out.
It's freezing.
Sure. Twinkie?
I'm chewing.
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
There's a TV in the basement.
I don't know.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
You like him? He worships you.
Wendy!
Huh?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Watching what?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
With who?
Her name's Libbets.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have plans.
Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.
Yeah? See ya.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
The ones you built?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Just thought I'd stop by.
Are you his girlfriend?
No.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Communist Viet Cong.
They left it in the jungle.
Vodka?
You never tasted the stuff?
One more shot?
Okay.
Huh?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
That's all, for now.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Good.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Sure.
What's that, then?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Too bad...
Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
But they're so boring. All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
We already did.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
Good. He's up next.
Yeah. All over.
Twelve years younger.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
Five feet? Seven feet?
About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Worth pursuing?
I know.
Byrd's dead.
Why?
Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Anything. It's important.
Right. Got lost in the rocks.
We'll get the other one, though.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Like I said, no. We know about those things up here.
Around twelve-thirty.
Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
No.
I told her to come.
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
I beeped you over two hours ago.
And something else that might interest you.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It's signed. Personally.
So?
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
How do you mean?
That boyfriend. Randy.
That's right.
Seven years.
You know what about.
To do nothing.
That's right.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>. On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
He's just rattling your cage.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
No way.
Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
What are we thinking?
Will?
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
What is it?
There's a guy down the hall. Complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep.
Huh?
Kay Connell. Did you love her?
You heard me that time.
She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
After that she left the party to go to him.
How should I know?...
Ran like hell to go to him...
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You're not missing much.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
Best friend?
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other.
Must be tough for you. What happened.
Long as it's fun.
Thought you wanted something fun...
That's what I said.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
What was?
My arm!
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
What was it?
Brody...I don't know... ...Something Brody!
The phone call. The knapsack.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
I was a mentor to her.
Yes.
Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
He. Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
Congratulations.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
But how did you come into existence?
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
No.
Perhaps...
Then God does not exist...
I have not spoken to him...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
Your lover.
No, my beloved, my child.
If you say so. You are innocent.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
But why?
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Then I leave too.
You said there were none.
How he must have loved you.
Yes... My God...
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
Louis, I swear I did not.
No.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
What night? What do you mean?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realise.
Is this my birthday?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
But you're the fairest by far.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
Stop her Louis!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Does it?
Not you my dear.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Why does he call you that?
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Claudia - don't -
Why not?
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
I took your life. He gave you another one.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock, Claudia...
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
And you never cried -
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
Yes...
Yes.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
How devilishly clever.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
And no one knows but us...
Yes, and very beautiful.
Be still!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Love?
Never.
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
What do you mean?
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Yes...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
NO!!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
Call him.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Yes...
Sure...
Dying?
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You have fed. You were made for this...
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Fascination...
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
I don't know any hell -
As did the one who made me.
I don't pretend to know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
I know. Let her alone.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
NO!!!
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
That and more.
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I didn't want to kill her.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Are you mad????
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
Yes. I remember...
You followed me here, didn't you?
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
So shall we begin? What do yo do?
I'm a vampire.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
What about coffins?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
He did it to make you stay with him!
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes...
And you know what you ask for?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
A child who can't die...
My daughter...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
The guy looks dead.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Yet. Nothing yet.
No.
No means yes.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Okay, okay. You're right.
I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
He does work hard.
Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Karla! You promised.
I also promised Tyrell.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Don't even think about it.
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Not me...no way...
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Some.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach.
Just kidding.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
I've got to see.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
It's okay.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
Never do that again.
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
Fine. Show me the body.
Who?
Ben Willis.
I told you.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
What?
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
It beets being on the mainland.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
It's in my room!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming.
Did you get help?
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Rio, baby!
Hello?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Hey --
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How's Julie?
Alone. In the room. Got any advise?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Yes!
Okay, Karla, five seconds. Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
How much?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Wanna drink?
Not anymore.
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Cool.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
So why are you still here?
Crowded.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
And do what with it?
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
I'll go find him.
She's in her room.
Drunk again?
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
My friend -- what can one say --
But why?
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
Thank you.
Sleep well.
I think not.
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Poor Cathy --
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
How old is she?
I was looking for you.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
They shall not hurt you
Thea is an orphan.
What an odd question!
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General  you don't even know him.
That should decide it or you --
It was, the plague
Whet do you mean?
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
That your father and I 
Wouldn't I?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know. He can't tell 
Yes?
Theodosia.
Her family name?
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
Why -- no not before Thea came 
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Oh, now  now look here 
I can't understand that.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
We have no time for that.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
But the war, the army  they need you.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
You are my friend.
Listen to what I say --
When you make sense I'll listen.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
I can't do that. These families have children.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Well, all right . . .
Who?
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I'm hurrying.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Don't . . . George?
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, very funny.
Well . . . . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Go through with what?
Suicide.
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Made what?
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I'm not supposed to tell.
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful!
That's your problem, George Bailey.
A boy?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
No!
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
All right.
Of course it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, sir.
Mother . . .
Mother? What do you want?
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
Well, what happened to you?
I won a flower.
Want to give my flower a drink.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Give the flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Uh-huh.
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Fine.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Hee-haw!
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Goodbye, Sam.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
A cattle boat?
All in . . .
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Please don't go away  please!
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Well then, how do you know?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Yes, sir.
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir.
No.
Anything I can do back here?
No.
Ummmm . . .
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Hope you enjoy it.
No. No.
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay. What's yours?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Oh . . .
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Did you get a doctor?
Say, where's Mother?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
What's that?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, what am I bid?
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Peanut?
How do you do.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
That way, huh?
George . . .
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
All of it?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Holy mackerel!
Hello?
Yeah . . . . . . you can take this one off now.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
All right, sir.
Have you notified the police?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Well, what about all your other friends?
Five hundred dollars.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
I'll take chocolate.
I don't like coconuts.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
Beautiful.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
You may kiss my hand.
Ummmmm . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Uh-huh.
Come on, tell me.
If I told you it might not come true.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
I'm going to scream!
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
Didn't you tell her?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
Thank you.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Mary . . .
That does it  come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Going up to see Zuzu.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You have no idea what happened . . .
I've eaten.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Huh?
You forgot something.
What?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Sure, sure I am.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Oh, shucks . . .
Hmm? Well, I . . .
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
What?
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
What the hell. For you....
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
I want to go faster!
So's mine.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
No problem, no problem.
What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it it sticks in my mind.
Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
Back down!
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
No.
Good. It's terrible.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shut up.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
I was counting on hours.
That's awful.
What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Shit. Shit, shit, shit!
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
Like hell! We're on the starboard tack!
You're betting what you already got.
Sean! Catch it!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Gangway, Turkies!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
Want to swim home?
You bet. Hang on....
Anyone got another set of sails?
Over here!
The rope! The rope!
Can you get us a line?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey ---
No! It's still there!
What is it? What's there?
It's still there!
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty.
Happy to do it.
Then check it out. I'll be in the office.
Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess.
Positive I.D.?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Oh.
What camera?
You got it.
Not the drugstore!
Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight....
You can't stop me.
But I signed for the boat. You' re not authorized any more.
Please. It's my job.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Hey -- you can't do that.
Got it.
No place special. Just hanging out.
Sailing?
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Do I have to?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
Bartending? I'm 17.
Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
Because.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
You stay right here. You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
You want to come here a minute?
I kind of had plans....
Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
Hey, come on....
Pop. I'm sorry.
It's okay. What happened?
At least you're safe. What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
What?
Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Me neither.
Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?
You're damn right that's what it is.
First things first.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?
Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
What shark?
We don't know that, do we?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
This is a mammal, not a fish.
That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
Sound?
Can't you tell?
Late.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
My boss and your boss. Sure.
Because they're playing our song.
And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
Fooling around?
Right.
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Better yet.
It's good with coffee.
So's a donut.
What're you guys doing today?
In the den.
For me?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
Santos' place.
Careful. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh. Want to talk about it?
No.
Terrific.
Do you?
The goddamn smell is always the same.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!
Sean's asleep.
That's great too. Gorgeous.
Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
I try. Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Going out.
Mike's out there.
Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Perfect. Look at this ---
What?
10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
That's it?
That's it. Just do it, all right?
10-4, soon as I can raise him.
Brody? This is Patrol Base.
That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Yeah? Then what?
That's what he said.
When?
1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.
Shouldn't he be at home?
No. Find your brother, okay?
What's daddy doing?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hiya yourself.
Dad! Dad!
I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay....
Sure they did....
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
Now I really want to see it.
You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Shh. Shhh....
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen. She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I will, I will.
Great.
Maybe.
Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
Great!
Ready?
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Help! Help!
Okay, okay, coming....
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.
Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
I know.
None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
3:30.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
I can't stop thinking!
What's that mean?
Huh?
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Double nope!
Just like this.
What about sailing?
The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
I dunno. We'll think of something.
And second?
Mmmmmm.
Wait a minute. Promise me something.
Anything. Anything.
What Kids? Who went out?
Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Anything?
Figure they split?
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
Power line.
Oh, great.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there. Wait up.
I'm not sure I can.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
You do everything your parents tell you?
No.
Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
I can go out if I want to.
Name it.
I love it.
Coming about....
Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Might as well.
Sean, baby, please....
When are we going out? You and me?
Not tonight.
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Coming about, then.
You always go with Andy.
How was dive class?
Yeah. Go on, beat it.
Eat Cheerios.
You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
No.
I want to go with you!
Quiet! Shhh!
Michael....
Okay, okay. Close your door.
Would you take him?
Brody's riding his tower.
Oh, shit.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
What the hell is he doing?
So? So?
So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Forget it, he won't listen.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.
Go on, you're tired.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
I can get it.
With those camera lights and...
He's going with you, Doctor.
Have you checked the bars? The guy's irresponsible; he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
And a missing man.
You buying?
Sure am.
Coming with us? Overman's buying.
Yeah. Down there.
Shit.
No.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
How many sharks have you killed?
Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
You will. I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
See you later.
Don't let him get you. Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton. He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
I can't leave now. We taking Sean out?
Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch. You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Get out of here!
We play hide and seek all the time. They find a lot of things.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn. Real cute.
Just put your mask on.
No.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
... Friggin' fish.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
I know, I built it. I've just never seen it this way.
Oh, yeah. Very.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Nothing.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.
Swim where? Out there? Oh, no, forget it, not me! You go, I'm staying.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Are you coming...?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I think so. I'm not sure... Are you?
I'm okay.
It's all right, baby. We're safe...
It's never over... Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Kathryn, you're crazy. Really crazy. A suicidal maniac.
I got it on sale. A real steel.
Here.
What's that?
Bracelets.
Yes?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why? 'Cause they're hungrier?
No.
You amaze me. I'm more scared than you.
No, you're not.
... Me, too.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Get some sleep. And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Sean, that's right...
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
You don't.
It's my new perfume. Great White, the Man-Eater.
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes. It's faster.
No, I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did. He wants it on exhibit.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
I have to get out of here.
Come on.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Yes, you can.
So?
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
That's just it, Michael. We don't!
What do you mean, we don't?
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You wanted to know about a cave?
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
You two go! I'll call Calvin!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Who's going to do it?
Me.
Michael, you're not going down there.
I am. You're not.
But you --
It's a construction job. I'm the only one that can do it.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
You don't have to prove anything.
Only to myself.
I'm fine.
On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.
Fine. Have them do some.
I don't know. They're nervous and skittish right now.
Yes, aren't we all.
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins.
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no. That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton. Not man-eaters --
That's preposterous!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Like hell!
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
So do I, love.
Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups.
What in hell is that?
We're taking that shark alive!
Let's hope he knows that.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Afraid I can't do that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Still sleeping.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I. But for different reasons.
And I like you.
Skillful? I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Philip.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
Thanks to you.
How'd it get in here?!
The water ski show! We have to get them out!
She, Mister Hutton.
He. She. Let's blow the bitch up!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
They still seem nervous.
I know.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
Don't blame yourself.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
Not good enough.
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Sure.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Come on! Check this out!
And alone.
Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific?
As always.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No. Of course not. Don't listen to him. He's - he's... ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
I know! We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature.
I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Now what's this do?
Goes up.
What, hon?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod! Be serious!
I am serious.
Balance, Kelly. Bal-lance!
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What?
On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something.
That?
Yes, there is goes.
It's disappeared.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
Precisely.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Thanks. Bullshot.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's large enough...
Five hundred yards.
You have a man near it?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
No way.
I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere.
Always do.
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
I know. But we show it's not closing.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Right, Mike.
All right, hit those lights too.
Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.
Sharks???
In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
So was Dad.
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
That's Dad...
Gee, it's good to see you!
I want to see Kathryn.
Just find your own. Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Something wrong?
You know Overman?
Don't hurry back.
It's all up to Kathryn. Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
We're in love.
Sure.
No, really. I've never met anyone like her before. This is it.
Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love. This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
Give me a 400-foot magazine; we may be down there for a while.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Absolutely. The audience will stain their drawers. I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
Not today. Come on, Thea....
Did you hear what I said? Come inside....
I don't want to. I want to swing....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad? Did you ever spank him?
My tea set. I got my tea set. Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Yes, I did.
It's time for tea, Grandma.
He told me you both did....
He was doing his job....
It was a piece of wood. A shitty piece of wood. It's not fair....
Nowhere....
No way....
Chicken....
It sure is....
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
I'll be right there.
Tell Matt he should be here....
My brain is shrinking. There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
I have work....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong? What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
How could you do that? Your own daughter....
Where's my mother?
I don't know....
I'm not on vacation....
I like it. Really....
I can't help it....
You caught me....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
It's beginning....
Whatever happens next.....
You make sure they come?
You have something to say about everything....
What difference does it make? It's here....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down. All of us....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
He knows what he has to do....
Stop what?
That....
I'm not doing anything.
Serves you right. Will you please stop....
Can't help myself....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I won't....
What's going on?
You can stay in my room.
I'd like that. I need to be away from here.
It's too dangerous....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
I'm still five....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
Thanks for the consultation....
Good night, Daddy....
I'll miss you....
You guys must be starving....
What?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water.... Never again...Never....
Dad died from a heart attack....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Come on, I'll show you around.
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
You were a monkey....
I'm fine....
Okay.
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Good. So will I....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
I am.
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day.
I'm pleased. I really am. Really....
No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
You just got here....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother. It's my job....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
No.
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship. It goes where I take it....
Mostly it feels like driving. You digging for buried treasure?
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it. It's just something I feel.
I always listen to my feelings....
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Doesn't matter....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
Where do I pull off...?
You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon. Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're impossible....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
Sharks come and go, Ellen. People don't have anything to do with it....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
A big one....
All or nothing. You want to roll them for me?
No!
You'll be sorry.
Good. I have two left....
I have my own little island.
But it gets cold in winter....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
You're always taking time off....
I like to travel....
What?
I borrow it without telling him....
Won't you get in trouble...?
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee. Can I drive the plane?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
The wind does that. Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I do....
I'm the artist. Like my mother.
Just like that?
Yes I can....
I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss.
We'll buy you one. We're having a party....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
She said it was coming....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It'll come for the plane. It's attracted to metal. The electro- magnetic impulse....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Get her started....
Aye, aye, Captain....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Nothing! What the hell are you doing down there?
It needs more time to charge.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Inch by inch....
How's Ellen?
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Feathers all over the place....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
I'll get her. Have a good Christmas, Matt....
You too, Michael....
Stop busting my hump....
Try the area around the wreck....
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
We'll pass around cigars....
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Forget it....
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Stop busting my hump....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
I've struck the mother-lode. I'm counting... spade work....
What?
Spade's a garden tool....
Holy shit!
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
So did I....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
Lots of times....
So far..
What she's got. Nine knots....
Shit....
What?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long?
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
Who?
Hoagie.
I don't remember. One day he was just here....
What do you know about him?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...? You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'A Moray eel....'
'Snuck up on me....'
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Don't be so down, man. Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
Tough shit. 'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
It'll work....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you. Get it on me....
Jake.
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Don't flatter yourself....
In a few minutes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Oh, Jake...
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
When he has a pillow over his head....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Anything to do before I go home?
Gone to Ben Masters' place. Cow tipping.
Cow tipping?
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Yes.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
How about any guys on your staff?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
I think you're here all day.
The <u>dogs</u>?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
O.K.
What does that mean?
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
Maybe?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
So am I. But where's my money?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
To throw out of the window.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I was wrong.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Car accident.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Hey ..
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
Bits.
What d'you mean, "bits."
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
You ain't going in alone?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
No.
Have you got a print from the hand?
No, Sir.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
No.
I want Serato .. Why can't I have Serato?
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Vehicle references.
Wrong cabinet.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Bullshit.
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
He ain't offerin me shit.
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
Me?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Yes.
What color was it?
I don't know.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Of course I would ..
It was probably the wind.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
You should. It's wonderful.
No.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
I was married to her sister ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
I know.
You know? How do you know?
No I'm not.
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
It's not possible right now.
Why?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I'm going back to the institute.
No .. not now ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
You do?
I'm blind because my father drank.
I wanna be near you ...
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Why?
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Freddy's new obsession ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
Whass going on here?
I'm already walking. Where is it?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
No, Sir.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I think I've found a hand.
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
Ugh!
Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Okay, this is working.
You are not a loser.
Let's go. I'll drive you. _ 45.
Jerry! Do something --
What do I do? How do I spin this?
Oh honey. It's spun.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Look, I don't want a --
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
I think you added the "brutal."
-- stop --
No.
It's over --
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
I see what you're saying.
Wait. What do you mean?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big.
"Something in the way. Yeah."
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
You're imagining it.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh, tell the story.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Well, take care.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Absolutely.
Same to you.
Hello?
Wait. That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck.
Hi.
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home. That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sure --
Yeah, thanks.
Good idea. Thank you.
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
Sure.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Mission... statement...
Oh shit. You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good evening.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Good night.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
Right. I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
Oh hell yes.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht. No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...
Will you marry me?
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
What --
It's not fair to you. This whole --
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I think we made a mistake here.
I don't like to give up.
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me. _ 118.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Of course I know --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thanks.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
No--
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I'll give it everything.
Said who? Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I'm sorry, I --
Here it is. "Show me the money." Show. Me. The. Money. _ 36.
Congratulations. You're still my agent.
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
I might call you later!
Very much.
Huh?
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
No.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Why not?
Uh, not today, but --
That's your word?
Great word. Towel?
No, I air-dry.
You.
No, I'm saying to be --
Fine.
Forget it. Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind.
It's a risk.
Good deal, man.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
Well, this was another way to go.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Don't I know. Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend.
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
Damn right.
For loyalty, you buy a dog. For love, you get married.
Fine.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go. Flee.
I missed ya. What can I say?
What --
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Jerry Maguire. SMI.
Bobbi Fallon. BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Well. Good luck with that --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
But wait...
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
And say what? "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
My husband believes in you. We're gonna make it. Bye bye Dorothy.
I'm freakin out. Oh God I'm --
The best commercial director in the business. I hail you.
You okay?
I'm fine. What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know. It sucks. I suck.
Dick.
You wanted smaller.
I'm over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?
No.
They do, my brother.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
Let's go the zoo.
Okay. I've been hogging it. You're right. _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
You said "fuck".
Yeah I know. I did.
Funny.
Funny... I better go to bed.
A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Right up ahead, buddy --
It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...
Can you be quiet?
What'd I say?
Shut up!!!
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
One way to find out.
What is it?
A bird cage.
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
What's a bad idea?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
People change.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Eric!
He's this way.
We have to help him.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Think.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
You mean it?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
I would completely support that.
Who's that?
Here!
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Where is it?
DAD!
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
then we should...
I didn't know, there were two islands.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
It won't hold!
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
They're here.
What?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Baryonyx?
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
KEEP GOING!
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
NO!
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really? What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
I try not to.
To a degree we never imagined.
The last of my breed.
Goodbye, Alan.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
In Costa Rica?
On the island.
Which one do you prefer?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Any weapons, radios?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Yeah.
What did you think?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Mine's new.
Are you sure?
Why?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Something must've scared them.
You should.
You're right.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
But you never came across just one.
Back out! Move!
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
How do you mean?
It certainly does.
No. I feel something.
Minimal.
Former academic. Now I actually make things. I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Because I didn't know! I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
It's the lawyers. The lawyers are finally killing me.
Well? Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
What are you talking about?
-- my --
-humidity, I know. Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?! Gene splicers?!
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Kelly! What are you doing here?
I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
That was about a year ago.
Well, is he?
No. Richard talked to his parents.
That Richard.
Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Come on!
What? Why?
Good lad.
To collect my fee.
Rex won't be any different. It'll come.
You've broken its leg!
Isn't it obvious?
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Operations building. Far end of the street.
Possible.
Why?
It's just fed. It won't attack unless it's threatened. Don't move.
Let it go, Peter. The animal won.
You version of it.
It was a payoff and an insult. InGen never--
Piss.
Oh, God.
Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
It has a broken leg!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No! Get in the car before they hear us!
What do you think they want?!
No way.
No.
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
It'll hold!
For sixty seconds, maybe! Look at this! You could-
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look! Sarah!
What's that?
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Because it exists.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Don't let it out of your hands again. Can the kid walk?
I'm her father.
Funded by whom?
John Hammond.
What?!
They're pushing us over the cliff.
What?
These formations. They're dried --
Birdshit?
Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
I believe in him.
Oh, no!
I'm trying!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you. MOVE IT OUT!!
Can the kid walk?
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Stop the program! Stop the program!
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
So how much for our first tour. Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
It could have been worse, John. It could have been a lot worse.
The door security systems are shutting down.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
What now?
Fences are failing, all over the park! A few minor systems, he said!
Find Nedry! Check the vending machines!
The monitors are failing.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Uh - - about two million.
Two million - - great. That would help. Oh good, that'll take no time.
Yeah, again, in theory, but - -
No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.
'Bout thirty seconds.
Remember - - viable embryos. They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Anybody at all. Feel free to speak up.
Six weeks?
These are dilated. Take a look.
They are? I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological. From local plant life.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Come along. I know my way around a kitchen. Come along.
Oh my God.
Could I have a tissue please?
Oh my God.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex. Guarantee it.
Why?
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Look.
Good! Keep going, now. The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
They do smell. Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty. Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Sattler.
Small versions of adults, honey.
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility. You're right!
How did you do it?! How did you do this?!
We're out of a job.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
I know.
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - totally incidental unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun!
I can't get it! I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
Alan!
I don't know.
They're not here.
What's that?
Okay.
Stick to my heels.
I can see the shed from here! We can make it if we run!
Why not?
Because we're being hunted. From the bushes straight ahead.
Like hell it is!
I get ah - -
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Anti-nature.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome. That's what?
Unpredictability....
Yeah.
Please - - chance it.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Faster! Shit, shit, shit, faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together. John's plan.
- - shut up.
Yes. It's not a criticism, by the way.
Hola, bienvenido
He sends his apologies.
Why not?
Because he's like me. He's a digger.
What are we looking for?
Dilophosaurus.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
Then they're expensive. Put them back.
Relax Donald, relax. They're scientists. They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man. I hear it's nice. Is it nice?
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
Tim. Which car were you planning on - -
Whichever one you are.
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, are you okay?
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet!
Tim, I'll come back for you. I'll get Lex out first.
That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
What if the car falls? What if the wheels fall?
You'll probably be safe enough on your own --
I doubt it.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
I don't know. What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
It's so strong! Look at its nose. Need help?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Amphibian DNA.
Nope.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go. I'm going to count to three.
You're crazy! I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, I'm right here. Easy catch. Easy catch. Count to Three..
Try to!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Occasionally. Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
You haven't touched didn't touch anything. We're stopping. We've stopped.
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
No.
The kids okay?
Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.
What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say I was scared.
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
You're sure?!
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
What? What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
John Hammond. And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
The brachiosaur? Thirty.
Sorry! It's kind of a ride!
Let's get outta here!
Wu?
Who?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!
Let's get you out.
That's not what I'm going to do. Good!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe.
It's safe.
Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
Alright.
No, I didn't hear anything. No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
I'll stay awake.
All night?
All night.
It's okay! It's okay! It's a brachiosaur!
You're a beautiful big animal.
Please!
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Okay. Keep low. Follow me.
Timmy! The power is coming down, quick!
Phone security systems, everything works. You ask for it, we got it!
Don't do that!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Wait a minute? What do you mean "worked"? Everything is still off!
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Thanks, Steve.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
Excellent.
Turn it off, Lex! Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
I don't know! I'm sorry!
What if we fall? I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
What?
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Shut up! You're scaring me. Stop! You're scaring me.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Really? How much?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Ken, we've been through this...
You want to put in chain saws?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Get rid of them.
Great.
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I really think we should go back...
I want to look at the rest of the house.
Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
And we're in the center ring. You sure you want to wear that blazer?
What?
His camera... it's still recording.
_Krueger_...
Who?
Come on.
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
What are the charges?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Who's chest?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
He's fucking nuts.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.
So?
That didn't sound very convincing.
Oh?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
How do we prove it?
Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Think it'll do any good?
And if he's not?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
My client... is dead. But I think he's a free man.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
What was the matter with it?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend. One link is all they need.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. Very good.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat -- And drink.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Yes.
Will you do me a favor then?
Another one?
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
Not necessarily. A <u>wife</u> would.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Yes.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
And you're late!
Sit down, Kafka.
In a small way.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
I do.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
I've never seen you here before.
Have you looked?
Yes.
No.
He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.
Two or three months, that's all. -- I seduced him.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Tonight?
Last year. I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you ...?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
He was murdered.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I wouldn't put it past him.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous? He's too cautious.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.
Yes. Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday. We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Eight -- and seven months.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
No. He didn't seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We know that.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
What did she say?
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
You mean you've actually begun some?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
-- You should meet my father.
It's a farce.
That's obvious, isn't it? We have an opening for a new member.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Then why haven't I been --
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
It usually is.
Yes. Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Orlac is an account?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I could always apply there.
Oskar.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?
And we're upset too.
Ludwig?
Here too! They're all in a dreadful muddle!
They'd drive us away. That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter. It's too late for all of us.
What's to become of us now?
Amerika for us!
Amerika!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
It's ... lovely.
Now Ann ...
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
Value? ... Value?
No!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I can't imagine you crying.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Sun's coming up ... We've been in the fog for six hours.
Leave it, Ann.
We're leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
No! Don't!
Jack!... Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Two... maybe three.
They' re dead.
Oh my God ... Ann?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
That's too bad.
A man eater! Fantastic! Making history, Herb
An ape ... some kind of ape.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
) They are now.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
What?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
Coz of something I lost.
What's that?
Compassion.
What's compassion, mister.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Did he come around often?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Please --
Guess!
Do you always have to repeat?
Sorry.
Well I have to close up now.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
So do I.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Well we're pretty --
Why isn't he locked up?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
No, that's not --
Here please.
Like for you to look for the man.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Will you let me go then?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
Tell me. I'll listen. I just want you to tell me.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Gee.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Mm.
What? What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I can't say he was anybody!
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How would I remember?
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
OK.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
-- OK?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
What do you think?
Can't you get him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
He never told me.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Well -- she's dead.
You said you wanted these.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways.
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Not much point to this, is there?
Thanks.
When?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
What the hell do you think's the matter. I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
But if it's someone else I do.
How?
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
We did this before.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Yup.
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
What am I supposed to say?
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Don't touch anything.
Drop it.
Right back at the start, right?
Go down in my room.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints. Can I go in? I need some stuff.
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You're going back?
Mm.
I am.
You could at least look at me!
They don't scare me any more.
What?
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Can you use these?
No. I'm sore.
I believed her, Pete.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
What?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I wanted to give it to you first.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
I've just got a few --
Not unusual.
Did she talk about him to you?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
No.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
Yeah.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
Nobody's seen that.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Trask --
Yes sir, we know he --
Yes?
He's in his room, playing.
Good. I'll see him in there.
Not particularly.
What does?
The prospect of losing my child.
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
Detroit.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Playing.
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Welcome to the...
Greatest...
Show.
Show...
On earth.
Soon. Very soon.
Wow! French toast, really?
That's right. You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Right. One O.J. coming up.
Soon. I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
What if she forgets?
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay? Don't worry.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Goodbye.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Sorry.
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
Can I be excused? I'm not hungry.
I guess...
Uh huh...
We use the green and yellow.
In a minute...
C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's okay.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
That's okay...
I hate it.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
You are not allergic of onions.
No. This is fine. Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
No.
You're no bargain either, pal.
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
Tough shit. You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep. It's very late.
Uh huh?
Are you...gonna go...away?
You mean for good?
Oh...
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
Dad?
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Sure.
Sure. Lots of times.
It's my name too.
Right.
You like it?
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
Sure.
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
No.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Uh, huh?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.
What else wasn't there?
Because...Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.
Like a principal?
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Who will read me my stories?
Your mom.
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Overruled. The witness will answer, please.
Sustained.
Overruled.
Yes, your honor.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Then I have concluded my questions.
And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Yes. Very much.
And yet you chose to leave him?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
No questions.
Objection!
Eight, almost nine years.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Yes...
And how did you find his work?
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
No.
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Do you have a lover now?
I...I don't know...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
How long was that?
We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.
Oh? What do you call it then --a success? The marriage ended in divorce.
Yes.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million-- What?!
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother--
I don't know...
So do you.
Fine.
You have?
He is... You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
You want what?!
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Beautiful.
Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late--
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Hey, Ted. C'mon in. I wanna' talk to you.
Yes, what?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Do you?
Kramer...
Murray.
Yeah?
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
I'm going to take it.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough... ...I get off duty at five-thirty. How long you been divorced?
Three months. How can you tell?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Fine.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him? I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Oh, no..
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Don't worry. I'll get the money.
Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Ted? Are you there?
Yeah.
Any prospects?
Don't worry. I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
I don't know.
She's the mother. That means she's within her legal rights.
John, what if she kidnaps him.
No, but--
How many?
Ten.
No.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying with him.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things. Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
I'm sure.
Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and Lex. The emergency number is 327-0800.
Slow down...Slow down...
Three. And add some basil.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
No. I don't think so.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
I told her you're doing a
Sure.
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
What?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Don't say that! I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Uh, huh...
Please, Thel...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma. You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
Ha! You tell me.
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Yes, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Kham, Holiness.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Again?
Tell me.
No cried?
I know.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
No.
But, I am in charge.
Are you? Of whom?
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Hmmm.
No!
Are you, General?
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Thank you. Please sit.
I have.
I have a copy for you.
Soon.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
It is calm.
We did not.
All?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I am afraid.
Time to study.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
Far, far away.
I miss him too.
How many?
Two.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
We do not know.
Answer.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
Do you have money?
I am him.
Not until you are eighteen.
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Tell me.
When it is time.
Look here!
Ask whatever you will.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I had relinquished doubt.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
The people will not allow it.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Thank you.
I leave tomorrow.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Me?
You will always!
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
You decide.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I have smarter men.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
It is a story, you decide.
Pretend.
As you say.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
The Chinese.
Yes.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
Ahh.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
But, I have no experience.
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
You have grown up very good.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Eliminate you.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
It may not be your decision to make.
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Much too young.
I see that.
Oh, yes.
No. Do you?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
You're all fuckers. Vicious little fuckers.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>? <u>Hector</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Wait just a second. You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Mr. Cyr!
C'mon, we're losing light, why does the big one heckle me?
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Keystone what?
Cocktail?
<u>No</u>!! What's with digging the holes?
No!! Out!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No crocodile has ever--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Yup.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
It came from across the lake.
Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector. I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood. Maybe you got him, Hank.
I don't know!
Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
He never said "go".
Get the gun.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Hey!!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
You do?
Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You talk to Bickerman?
Just those two.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
I'm just saying last resort.
As if. Will you miss me?
Are you sure?
Scales were oval. It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
I'm a civilian! You don't have any authority--
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Excuse me?
No.
Eh. Fuck it.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...
Could we have intercourse?
They won't. He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.
Yeah. Thanks to you.
And Hank. I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Never been to Maine before?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never <u>believed</u> it.
I <u>told</u> you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Well. You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is. It <u>is</u>.
Who?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I'd be able to see something.
I beg your pardon?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
'Night.
Good luck.
Yeah. Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
That's probably good.
Um... y'know... Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Excuse me?
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just forget it.
Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Keep it dry. No swimming.
Thank you.
Night.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
What?
I heard something.
Maybe. Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
<u>No</u>. I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.
You calm down!
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Look.
We might as well pack.
Good idea.
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
He's floating. Take it home.
Hector.
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
Take him.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
I don't care. Hank. End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
You wanna ride in my truck?
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Yeah.
But we do. Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.
Ready. A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Let's go.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Obviously I was wrong!
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Other than to eat us?
Where is he?!
I'll take it!
Hector. <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
Don't count on it. We better take him out.
You too.
Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there.
Yes.
Is the dead guy in there?
That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well. At wakes.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
Seconds. Three, four.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.
Okay. And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
<u>We</u>?
I got nothing against--
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
It's just that--
Sheriff.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I told you. Two days, we'd have to camp.
I thought I saw...
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
<u>Apologize</u>?
I'm sorry.
I asked you to be nice to him.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
You like Jack?
<u>What</u>? I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
I don't know. It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
I think. My hair. Where's Hector?! Where is he?
Yes.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. Could you cut me down?
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
What?
Look ten feet into the water.
She's worried about the cow now.
Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you?
That it's about to go wrong.
I don't know. Back the truck--
Wait.
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
Me too.
You work for me. I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...
Else.
Yes, well... famished.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
I'd like you to check out this lake. See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>. That's ridiculous.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have. How did you even know where I was.
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
You and Kevin.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
I'm not upset, Myra, okay. I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
I really... I should get back.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Thanks, Ardelia.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
He's here, Ardelia.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
What girl?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Hot damn, Clarice.
He knew her...!
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Where?
Sometimes.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Good idea.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Oh.
Not yet! - just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds.
Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I think we may be, yes.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Yes sir.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Miggs has been murdered.
Murdered...? How?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
What would it take?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
You do until six p.m.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Five... so far.
All flayed...?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
No. You ate yours.
Reasonably so. Yes.
How did - It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Ahhh... Why?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Mmm. And what else...?
A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.
Did he try to?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No! That's incidental.
Early. Still dark.
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
What was it?
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
Yes...! They were screaming.
So you ran away...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Yes. I'll tell you.
Promise...? Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Goodbye, Clarice... You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
Did you breast-feed her?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
We leave in the morning?!
Yes, miss.
Can we rest soon?
Absolutely.
Let us go, miss.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Your "father"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
He did?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
What?!
Why did they turn back?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Thank you so much.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
How did you learn English?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Miss. May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
What would you have me do?
Do not. Promise me.
Maybe...
Our father? Did you see my father?
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...
There was none!
What?
There was no letter.
I sent three men to Webb!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Aversion? No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
...Fort William Henry.
Day and a half Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
He is Huron and nothing else. Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Ottawa!
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
We don't.
I don't understand!
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
: Only one or two loads.
Your enemy...
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
We'll see in the morning...
You're not coming with us?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Yes, sir.
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Sir!!! Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Sir!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Atten-hut!
Yes sir!
Fire!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Yes.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
For Munro children?
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
And this?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Granted.
My colors?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Be my guest.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
He did.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I'm not a doctor.
For this...you don't need to be.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Why Sixpack?
No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Was there such a thing?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Stay calm!
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What?...
What has?
One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
He did.
Crunch...Implosion.
Can you fix it?
No way...
Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
No.
No!
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up! Try this!
Just get in yours!
Huh? I...uh...uh...
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
What?
Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
Roger... More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Why can't we pick up his signal?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
No. I'm just being friendly.
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here?
The escape bubbles?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Maybe they already have.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
Can't we fix it?
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
He's not at his station.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
All right...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
It bit me!
Jones...come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set. Backing off. C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Roger.
Ahhhh!
Okay.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
No...she killed herself.
I know that.
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Beautiful.
Unfortunately. We can't.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman... Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Hook's on 24...
Russian.
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Take it off and let me have a look.
Shhhh...don't tell no one. Job security.
What music? There ain't no music.
Pretty good. He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Twelve hours!
What? That?...I've done this one before. You hungry? I'm hungry.
Under there?
Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
No fuckin' lie...
I don't know. I'm guessing.
Let's hope it holds.
Jameson? Who're you trying to con?
"Debbie Does Dallas"... Hell, it's in Russian. I can't read it...
Sixpack...
How is he?
I ought to smack your face!
DeJesus...It's got him.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
The air's stopped.
She's wondering what's happening. We're losing air faster than I thought.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson? Who are you trying to con...?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I'm not touching you!
Your pocket?
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
Right.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hardly.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
Well, talk.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Well what?
And Tom took care of them.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
They were . . .
I am not fucking interested.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Chris. You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Nope.
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Yes?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
You had better be careful.
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Try that one.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
All right, Kenny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
How about you? All right?
There is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Plank?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Hit the fuckers.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Why, what's up?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Right as rain.
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
What do you mean, me?
. . . What?
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
I'll only be a minute.
A hundred grand.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
And?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
You've already been fifteen.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What about all the gear?
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
Er, fertilizer.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Just shut up.
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Oh, come on, Amado--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
Leave your sister out of it.
--you're going to be on your own.
So?
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
They stole our land--
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
I can fix cars.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Catholic school, nasty.
No, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The--the officers.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
You really want to know, sir?
Please.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do whatever they tell you--
I mean, follow orders, sir.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Chaos.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Will this go on my record?
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm feeling okay--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skinny?
That badge--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Yeah.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got a cause of death?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
He swore by it. What?
Just wondering.
So is Buddy on your short list?
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
Do I seem jumpy?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Same weight I always was.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Best part of the job.
What?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Come on in.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
He never asked her.
No sir.
Go out through the back.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Both.
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Tanks, huh?
No.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Good.
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
He does.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
It's not just cactus. There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Cliff--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
You going to get married?
Maybe.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
It's a .45.
Yeah?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
You could take it--
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
Masons been around a long while.
Old bullets. He uhm-- makes art with them.
Pleased to meet you.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
If the next guy's a redneck.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
This is an official visit, then--
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
Right.
I hear things, too. People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Why would you want to do that?
Because I'm your father.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
What's in the back?
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
You carryin' a firearm, son? Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Aqui! [Here!]
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
We have a daughter.
Tipico.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
He was a unique individual.
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
He still living?
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got an idea what happened.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
The Perdido thing?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Your mother's family is Spanish?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
The Sheriff.
You told me one time it was true love.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
How come you never got married again?
I was too busy.
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
I've seen 'em.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
What was your deal with him?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Of course you can.
What?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
For a while.
What do you think?
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Enough with the clothes--
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
I only went for my last two years.
How come?
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I'll see what's going on.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Are you okay?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Want to take a walk?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
So she tells me three times a week.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
People liked him.
Most people did, yeah.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Weird what you remember.
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
No--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You've got your mother, your kids--
They've got me. Different thing.
Pilar--
Yeah.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Nothing.
Yeah?
I came back 'cause you were here.
Yeah.
How come it feels the same?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
More, I hope.
Two years.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Couple months before I was born--
Yeah--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
The shooter local?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I been working on a few things.
Uh-huh.
I'm going over to the other side.
The Republicans?
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
Oh.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's up?
We'll get 'em-- So you livin' out here now?
Yeah. It's quiet--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Sure.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
You sell much out here?
But you don't see much competition, do you?
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Me neither.
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Payne.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
I know that.
Why you think that was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
You believe that?
Yeah. It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
You bet.
I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
Who is he?
I think maybe he taught Swann. This is me. See ya around.
How?
It'll be something hokey.
You heard right.
You ever been married?
My life was too weird for her.
I love weird.
Nope.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
Knew what?
I'm out of here, man! Are you coming?
Hey, anytime. Actually, no. This was enough.
D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
Beats me.
Deep shit?
I told you --
All right. It was...
I know him. I saw him.
No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you.
He won't.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I don't know.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about. The rocks...
It's him... it's him.
It was me.
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
Maybe he'll show you.
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Be ready.
He's with us... He's with us...
Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared. They knew the Puritan was coming home.
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Yes.
Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I think we make our own futures.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Why not?
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Does that mean...?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery.
Harry.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
Sure.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yes. I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why? Because he had you?
He... didn't have me.. I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go.
Okay. I'll keep digging.
Yes. You do that.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
Stuff?
Some or it.
Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
What then?
No it isn't. You can't help me.
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing?
Nothing you don't want.
Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. He's dead.
I know. I'm the one who shot him.
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them.
It's okay.
Find Valentin! Find him! Get him in here!
It's all right. It's not hurting...
Hang on!
You can't.
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I think so.
Harry-?
Out! Out!
Good. There. Yes?
You saw this?
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom? Me? I don't think, so. Try him again at the hotel.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic...
... they believe you.
Yeah. Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I just saw him.
Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
No. I'm not going near him.
He got up and walked.
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
--vanished.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
No. Not yet...
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Heaven and Hell?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
What about Swann's miracles?
I heard he was the best.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted.
Evil. He was evil. Come on.
Fuck you.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
What are you, my mother?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in-- Shit! I'm outta here.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
Nah. You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Probably.
It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
Looking for you. I tried the hotel.
Why'd you come here?
A ticket home,
Yes. It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
What for? You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
No.
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
Yeah, I know.
You want more money, is that it?
Shut up!
No.
Yes.
You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
Yes.
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Shit...
Help me.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
Shut up. We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
A Mister Quaid?
She has no real grip on reality.
Does anybody?
Too late. Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yeah. You could say that.
I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible... coming home...
The Puritan?
Yes...
Who is he?
What?
That.
At birth. I don't know you --
Harry D'Amour.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Not the Walter Wilder?
Sure. Vivovich.
People are pretty cagey. Who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so. You need me alive.
Why? So you can fuck my wife?
Or murdered, like Nix.
He deserved it.
Oh yeah?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
It's me betrayed him.
Help me.
Will that do? No?
Didn't know you read minds.
No.
Who else did? Did Valentin?
Yes.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Fuck.
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Try.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
I got to go. I'm late.
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Who is she?
No.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
No. He's coming back. He's digging his way out!
You don't think I've got it to give?
No!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Not true.
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yes.
No!
Liar!
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?
Yeah, I'll stay.
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Thanks.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
See you later.
I know, it's stupid.
No.
Hi, Charlie.
No way.
Ok.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, its easy.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't know.
Really?
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I don't remember.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Ok, whatever you want.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No, I was looking at you.
Oh, for her show?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Oh.
You're possessive.
I know.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
Oh.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
No one ever tells you that...
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
How old is she?
Four.
Oh, she'll love it.
Fuck off.
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
Yeah, look at that thing.
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
Do you know where we are?
No.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
I don't want to be.
A coke.
Around.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
Well, I mean it more now.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Why can't it last?
Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
That'd be great.
Yes, no.
Yes.
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Ok, bye.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Can I enter?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Yes?
Take them.
Hello, darling.
Ok, well... I love you.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Good-night.
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Like Japanese food.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Oh, come on.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to-
What?
Do you want to talk to Zoe?
Yeah.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
That's ok.
When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Bye.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Great.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Excuse me?
Hospital?
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
One moment.
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Why do you have to defend her?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Good...I'm tired.
You wanna come?
Sure.
Ok.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
I gotta go to work.
Bye.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
I don't know.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Its bad for you.
Ok, I will... later.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
It's ok if you are.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you have to go?
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Sure.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Promoting that action movie I did...
It's amazing there!
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
No! Hi! So great to meet you!
Do you think they have a room here?
She's a talk show host. They can't be charmed. By definition.
It's probably trivial.
Bad?
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off. Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Sushi.
Hmmm.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My favorite.
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
Well, it's a nice surprise. Should I hit the "stop" button?
What happened?
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
I don't know. In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I believe in you.
Claire...
This is the person...you were talking about?
I don't know. What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
I found the pentacle.
So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire.
You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
Yes. It's exactly...
Eight. That okay?
And how would you describe him?
Quiet. Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders what did the defendant request?
It's nothing.
Sure it is. If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Not the guards. Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You have to tell me who did it.
My secretary?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
No, I wasn't, actually.
Of course not. They put him through severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
What did you hear?
You heard voices, you know you did.
He will. He has great faith.
But bad judgement. And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
I hope so.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
I don't have the experience. Father Thomas should officiate.
You ready?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah. It didn't make any sense.
Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect. The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
Just open the door, please.
Father, I'm right here.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Yes. We won, that's right.
Um hm. That's right, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
Would you like to rest, Miette? You must be exhausted.
Miette, come here and relax.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Kelson, hold on a second...
Thirteen. The last time, can you believe it? This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Well I know he's come here before.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
I didn't know what else to do...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself. He created the voices after the fact.
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.
Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil. That's correct.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you. Listen, Ms...?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
What do you mean?
It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.
I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.
You're right. I must've made a mistake.
I had to.
Peter, please...
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.
The good outwitting the bad. It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So what?
Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother
Yes.
I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What's the...OH SHIT!
What?
When's your birthday?
What?
That can't be right. My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
Comfort.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
That's true.
I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in.
Maybe that's my problem.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend. Get rid of me. I would've...
What about after?
What are these?
I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
And his message was "Together, no matter what?"
Not a lot.
It's me. Put the gun down. Maya...
Whish the circumstances were different.
I know who he is.
Maya? What do you mean?
I'll explain everything later. Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya. They're not going to help us.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now. We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You are the younger of two...
Suit yourself. But does this mean anything to you?
Goodbye.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Nice suit.
Lemme guess. The lottery.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Of course.
Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Hey, don't thank me. Somebody up there likes you.
How're you doin' today?
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
She told me she killed them.
Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Nothing.
Oh, all that work.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Pants.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I can't eat before a game.
Child, take a bite.
Sure. In between all the other things I have to do.
Nothing. So good luck.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
Dad around?
He's still at the bank.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Need any help?
I can manage.
How is he?
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
Yeah, you met her?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Don't curse.
There you go.
No I don't.
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's not it.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Camille, she'll be fine.
The blue.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.
What'd you do?
He's fine.
Okay.
Okay?
It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.
This time get your feet set.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
You want the job or not?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
You're cold?
Oh, sorry.
Sort of.
Careful.
Huh?
That was two words.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
Shh. It's okay.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it.
It's okay.
Why are you up? Get in bed.
Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...
Monica. You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Yes, we appreciate that.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
Get used to it, babe.
Four days.
Why not?
You might be the only one with a job.
To do what you love.
I don't know sometimes.
No.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Found? I'm not some charity case.
I know...
Mom tell you to do this?
No.
Damn, Lena... Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
You do.
Yeah, right.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust.
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off. Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You lost your head.
I was just showing emotion.
I know. But chances are...
Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad. What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
So how's the job going?
I'll take that as a compliment.
She hates all freshmen.
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Just wanted to say good game.
But?
No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Thanks.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?
Never let a freshman take your spot.
What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy? My bad.
Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
How's that been?
I wouldn't know.
What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Just not my type, I guess.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me.
Lucky.
It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.
For real?
Uh huh.
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't know. A lot.
I don't care.
Oh.
How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them.
Kay.
Okay.
For how long?
Five seconds.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?
So that means I have to ride with you.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Shut up!
I know this. What do you want?
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Please.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Big-ass titties?
And?
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
I don't.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
God, here we go.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Would you watch the damn road?
I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
Good.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
You either.
Hey.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
He ain't Spalding.
Guess not.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Figures.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
None of your business.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
That what you think?
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What?
You had four offensive rebounds.
It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...?
You sure?
I know, right?
Yeah.
What'd it say?
You do see me standing here, right?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I said fine.
Quit.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Then prove her wrong.
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
What?
My court, I go first.
Plan to.
Right here.
I wanted you to.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I...can't.
Why not?
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Nah. Don't sweat it.
Quincy...
For real. I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Here I am.
It happens, right...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
Look, this party's whack. You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
Not really.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Nah. I have curfew.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, sorry about that. I had this meeting with this guy.
The "man" again.
Woman...
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
You forgot to be there.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
You're what?
I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Uh huh.
I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool.
Thanks.
I'm alright. But you can sit.
I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yup.
What are the doctors saying?
A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
I forgot, "Q-man."
We won the championship.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Kiss my ass.
Oh yeah?
Figured it was something like that.
What do you mean?
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
A rest?
Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
No.
Thanks.
Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.
Maybe go back to school.
Wow.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What?
Find.
We need to talk.
What?
From basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Better late than never, right?
Wrong.
What?
One game. One-on-one.
For what?
Your heart.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Hey.
Your hair looks so cute like that.
C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Well, can you give him this for me?
I don't wanna look fast. Thanks, girl.
What? Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.
With who?
Business folks.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
At one in the morning?
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Nona, please.
He tore his ACL.
Happy. And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
Yeah.
Uh, your earring?
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.
What are you doing in my room?
We were just studying.
You hearing me?
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Still the man.
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Sorry. You okay?
I'm fine.
Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
This is just about money, you know that.
Quincy, please...
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Why not?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
That's right.
I don't care about the team. I care about the school.
Didn't we already have this conversation?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You know, people.
there's this thing out there. This paternity suit.
What?
I just told you.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it. It's not true.
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We need to talk.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father.
Lucky kid.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I ain't a damn liar.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
No.
Good.
Yeah.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Oral surgery. Corrective teeth surgery.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
I don't know.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
In my sleep, Burt.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it. Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
What's wrong?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hello, Phil.
It is. Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
OK. See: Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Does this sound weird?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough. I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is. So why call me?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It's me. Claudia. It's me.
No. No.
I want to sit. I want to talk to you.
Don't sit down.
I'M NOT CRAZY. Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
FUCK YOU. YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
baby, please, please --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
LAPD. Open the door.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm coming!
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
No one else in there with you?
Ok. Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
What?
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, but I don't know --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
No.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yeah.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Who was it?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
It's fine.
You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That's great, thank you.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
You take cream or sugar?
Arlight, then. Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
Okey-doke.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
No. No. Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia. Please, now.
I'm sorry.
Ok, then. Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Just Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
What is it? Did you forget something?
Please, yes.
Well...is that illegal?
No.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Yeah.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Oh, see? This is great. Ten o'clock.
Great, bye.
Bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
Why not?
No, no.
You wanna make a deal with me?
ok.
What?
You really use strong language.
I'm sorry --
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
...nothing. I'm sorry...
No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
ok.
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah, of course.
What?
I'm sorry --
That was so great what you just said.
It's ok.
You don't know how crazy I am.
It's ok.
I've got troubles.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Yes I do.
What?
Just say no.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
please, what is it, please --
just let me walk out, ok?
Yes.
You alone in there?
You mind if I come in, check things?
Yes.
What's your name?
Claudia.
Claudia What?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
I want a shot of tequila too.
-- what kind?
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
Where's Richard and Julia?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room. See you later --
It's upstairs.
Have you ever been there?
Sure, why?
Cynthia?
What?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
I don't know.
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won. We fucking had this game.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Son, don't --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
-- no.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
DAD --
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today. My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope. So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
No Can Do.
No.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm a rapper.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh? You got a record contract?
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
I'm almost done.
Finish it up without the lip.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
I was listening --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
-- and I'm through playin' games.
What's up?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
Fine. Phil, you still there?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend.
Is it real love?
Well --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
No. I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What? What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
What?
That's right.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Brad, dear?
Picky, picky.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Shall we drink to that?
Mmm.Hmm.
You see?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I'm sick.
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Yeah.
I'm listening. I'm getting better.
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
You do?
...ah...
Where is he?
Get a girlfriend.
I'm trying.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
When was the last time you talked to your son?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
-- memory?
Time lines, y'know? I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
"yeah." the fuck do you know?
I've seen it before.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.
...cocksucker....
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Do me a personal favor --
Go fuck myself?
You got it.
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Who are you gonna call?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Who?
Jack.
Is Jack your son?
Frank Mackey. That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
No.
...Lily...?
No.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Twelve.
....getthat on the tv....there...
Hi. Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Yeah. You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Alright. Thank you.
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Like I said, yeah --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
Muffy -- coffee?
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
I would just want to clear some things up:
Yes.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
She does. From when you were a boy.
Mm. Hm.
She lived in Tarzana.
What am I doing?
Yeah.
I'm quietly judging you.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
-- fuck you.
Around here.
the valley?
Hollywood, mainly.
And what did your parents do?
Well I guess it doesn't.
Does you mother still work?
She's retired.
Are you close?
She's my mother.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
From '84 to '89.
Psychology major?
Right.
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
In five years?
What name? My name?
It's not your given name, right?
My mother's name, actually. Good question. You've done you're research.
And "Frank?"
"Frank" was my mother's father.
They wouldn't?
no, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you. We got dissconnected.
I got your message. That you were trying to get me -- right?
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
Ok.
For six months. I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh. What's going on?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
When did he go off chemo?
About three weeks ago.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
I don't think, he can't...
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
You're just come in --
Calm down.
I am calm.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
There's no disturbance.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No one else in here?
You're here.
OK. That's true. Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
Ok. What's your name?
Marcie.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I preffer to stand.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
You on any medication?
No.
Been drinkin' today?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I didn't hear anything.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
...you know...
Did your wife find out?
No.
Then what?
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I'm sorry.
I need you to get me Paula --
You want her right now?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
For 25. Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy. She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
Love you too..
Bye.
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
I'm a bad person.
No. No.
Yeah.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Was there anyone that I know?
Yes.
Who?
Rose, I don't --
hey.
Paula. Ellen.
No one else that I know?
No.
How long with Ellen?
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
What about now?
It's over. I talked to her this morning.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Do you have any children with anyone?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
I don't.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I don't know....
I'm not mad. I am, but I'm not. Y'know?
I love you so much.
I'm not through asking my questions.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that you know.
Maybe...I don't...
Do you know the answer to this?
...No....
I don't know.
I really don't know.
But you can't say....
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
...I don't know...
I don't know what I've done.
Yes you do.
I don't know what I've done.
You should know better.
Hello. Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes. What's your name?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
No, I'm just a friend. What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Yeah. She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
No. But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Saucy-saucy.
No.
What's MOW?
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it. Why can't one of you do it --
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
You need to sober up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Linda --
I have to go.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Hi.
mmmhmm.
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Phone number.
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
Yeah.
What would you like?
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
mmm.hmm.
Water.
Bottled Water?
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yeah.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Yeah.
Ok. One of those. And...um...Barely Legal?
yeah.
Do you have that?
yeah, I said. Is that it?
That's it.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29. Thirty minutes or less.
Thank you.
What do you do?
Maybe.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
We need more dog food --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
I said I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Why did you do this?
Yes.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Go to bed.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Go to bed.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
Yes.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
It's not right.
I hate it.
I have money.
...what...?
I have money to give you.
No. No. I have to do this on my own.
It's frogs. It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
No, M'lady.
That is good.
M'lady...?
No, stay back! Stay back!
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry. What is wrong?
Nothing... Nothing.
D'Artagnan.
We have much to discuss. Tomorrow.
I couldn't tell you. You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you? Alone?
I am preparing for a ball!
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead! By God's choice! There is nothing to discuss.
Yes. Dead. Two nights ago. The night of my dream.
My guards are useless! Take her from me!
He is your brother!
He is nothing now.
Wear it until you love it. And die in it!!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Phillippe?! Why do you call me --
Shut up, knave!
Replace the king.
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
A body.
I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Tomorrow.
I have it all worked out.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing! Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
And people close to him, who --
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days.
Three days??!!
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
We must stop him!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. Do you notice?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Paris. There is still much to do. We'll be back soon. Be ready.
But Aramis -- ! Phillippe can learn in time, but --
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King. So do it.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
We can't... stay here. That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
You're a fool!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
To the Bastille. And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
I will need you all. All for one. One for all.
I know. God go with you.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
Phillippe, get into the boat. Into the boat! Now!
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
That doesn't matter now.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb? We're in a tomb?
Catacombs. Very holy.
I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
The child of the king is... the king. Louis!
No, not Louis!
Athos, do you understand this? He confuses me --
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
Come on...
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Did she have tits like that?
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
The Queen Mother. Anne.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
He is right, d'Artagnan.
Who does?
Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
They must stay sharp. There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I fear I know our King. I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Get out of my way.
Athos, I beg you --
To kill the king.
The cannons killed Raoul! The cannons, and love. But not the King.
I came to see you safely out. Check for yourself.
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
I will sit with you. I can't sleep either.
Porthos told me.
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Just... water.
Phillippe. Rest now.
What is it, d'Artagnan? Assassins falling from the sky now?
I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
A personal nature?
You dare criticize my father?! Or lecture me?!
Silence! I order you!
Thank you, your Majesty.
It... was nothing. A nightmare, nothing more. Go away, I --
... tired. Must... lie down.
Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain!
Yes, your Majesty.
... You knew you had a double?
He is my brother.
My twin. Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
I must insist, Sire.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
Thank you, Keeper.
Eh?
What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.
Two-thirty-seven: "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
What was the end page?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
You may go, Lieutenant.
Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
When he returns, watch him. When he leaves again, you tell me.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Shoot them! Shoot them!
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
You blush! You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
A letter. May I see?
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely. It's just...
My dear, I've already done it.
Sire, I --
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Cooperate?
Every step of the way.
If you guys want in, fine. Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
So what?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
You mean shut your ass down!
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Alright, stay on the phone.
Did you report it stolen?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
We're all gonna fan out! C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't worry -
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Fine...
Right behind you.
Fine -
Our getaway car. You said a cell phone?
Did you start out area six?
Yeah...
Yeah I saw 'em around. They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
What?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah, it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
Nothing! He didn't do nothing!
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
What? Wait a minute -
Could explain why Fleming was there.
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage! Some lead...
Who is it?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Yeah?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
You got any family?
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
No.
Only on dates?
You'll find out - soon enough.
I didn't. I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No. A witness.
What exactly did you see?
Yeah...they did. One girl...
What did you do then?
I took it with me. It's in a safe place.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
No -
Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Jim Trudell! Bravo company!
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
Yeah...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story. Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
Please...
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Yeah I'm sure! I did it with my own hands!
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
Let's see what we got...
No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
A bank?
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Shit, we just started. But I better log out of this.
I'm not going anywhere!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Hop in.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks. I admit this is...unusual.
Are you a regular there?
Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
Ditched you?
Screw him!
Not with this...
What?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
No. It wasn't like that!
Then what did you do, play canasta?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I don't recommend it.
Christ!
Right. What about sweating Lecktor?
Twenty minutes max.
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Where?
Library of Congress.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
'You're very beautiful.
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Why not?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I am all right.
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
Personal ads?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
When I'm done.
How do I know?!
There has to be.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
What?
Something Lecktor said.
You wanna watch this or what?!
What's that?
Don't talk to me!!
Have him peel the top label back.
See if there's another label underneath.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
What?
Three minutes.
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
Let's get to the physical.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Tonic will be fine.
In the kitchen.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Uh-huh.
It's a surprise.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'm fine.
I'll get my purse.
I'll get it. Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room. I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Yes.
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I don't want to know.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...
In a little while I'll help you understand.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
Good. We'll seal your promise with...
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
As long as it's on soft paper. You may... Find this curious.
Uh... sure...
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda doesn't come in nights.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Thank you very much.
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Goodbye.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead.
He only bit women so far, right?
What happened to them?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What would you call him?
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
No.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh?
Huh? Will? Is that you?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you...
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin?
To do what?
I have to see somebody.
Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue, then.
Blue is cold.
I love you...
Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
Then why?
I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.
Can you quit?
No.
And... where are things?
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
Will? Are you okay?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
What's the problem, Molly?
Will? You could come up here.
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Yeah. That's great. A little time. I tell you what, buckaroo... See you around.
You got a deal...
You going back down to Florida after?
Yes. Is Molly there?
What's that?
Tell her I called.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in. Honey...!
I can't thank you enough, I...
Yeah...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
How?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
...yes.
Huh?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I got it. Thank you.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
You read about it, I'm sure.
Why should I tell you?
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
Let's walk the route.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No. Caspiar.
I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
"No"? "No" to which part??
No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.
I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
Of course! That's what negotiations are for.
Those are my terms.
Hi George!
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course. But only on Monday nights.
That's alright. Where...?
What's up?
Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?
Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!
Oh no! Did he get hurt?
WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.
That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
Oh!
Twenty!
Ten.
Deal.
Okay, great! So let's reset!
Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
I'm here, ain't I?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Yes.
If you want...
I can shtop whenever I want...
I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
Okay. You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"
You're not listening to me --
Don't worry! The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
GET OFF!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
So? What do they know?
No! Andy, don't do it --
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's so dirty.
Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Who gives a shit?! It's not funny!
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Goals are important.
Yes, your Holiness?
So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Andy, don't raise your voice. We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
Positive.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I GOT A CONTRACT!! I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Er, yes. Speaking.
"Speaking"! Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Kaufman's a lying bastard! If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out.
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?! I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room. All his "friends" are in there.
Where?
There!
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?! That kid is totally meshuga.
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
Bob.
"Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"? What is that, Polish?
Yes.
SHUT UP! I hate them Polish jokes!
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about! Here! I'LL give you a little humor!
Does that surprise you? It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target. The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
We have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Know what?
Hurry!
They won't make it.
And you are?
Smith. I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way. Not possible.
What?
That's the third white van I've seen.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
It's Choi.
I know. It's her fault.
Two grand.
If you get caught using that --
I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
Right...
I don't know... My computer...
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.
Hear what?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher? Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
An accident?!
No!
He's going to pop!
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix? Yeah.
... Yeah.
Five. Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead. All dead.
How?
Any time.
I need an exit! Fast!
Cypher?
Just get me outta here.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
Goddamnit!
Go.
Shit! Apoc?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes. Maybe six.
I know, Trinity. Don't worry. He's going to make it.
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Yes. Now.
Yes.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
But what if...?
Go! Now!
How do you know all this?
There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it.
The agents --
... Yes.
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
It's an honor.
Please. Come. Sit.
Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Do you want to know what it is?
Be what? Be real?
Far from it.
Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
More important than what is when?
When?
Wild, isn't it?
For what?
Your training.
Show me.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
The body cannot live without the mind.
I think I do.
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Yeah.
Look again.
What's going on?
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
Why?
Yes I do.
Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them?
Trinity! Go! Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
I need the main wet-wall.
Good.
Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Yes, sir.
Do it!
He is the One. He is the One!
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
Shit, I'm sorry.
Who?
Not too bright though.
Honestly? I don't know.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not the One.
Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What?
Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.
Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
How do you know that name?
My name is Trinity.
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Most guys do.
No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
From what?
From you.
Why?
... shit.
We think you're bugged. Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
Easy, Neo. Easy.
What?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
No.
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me...
... right as rain.
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
What happened? What did you see?
It might have been. I'm not sure.
We can't leave him!
We have to!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I don't know. It just went dead.
There has to be something that we can do.
What choice?
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
I have to.
What?
I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
Because...
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Yeah?
Do what?
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving.
Not yet.
No.
You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city. The only place we got left.
Where is it?
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
Hell yes!
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
How?
What do they want?
Neo, this has to be done!
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...
Because I believe in something.
Guns. Lots of guns.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Duck!
Kick it in! Kick it in!
Tank, it's me.
He's alive.
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Got it.
I'll be all right.
Dozer?
You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
What the hell just happened?
An Agent! You have to send me back!
I can't!
I don't know. I lost him.
Hurry, Neo.
Yeah. But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Thanks.
Look fella...this is private...
Nothing's private...
Let go of her.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit.
Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
That means it's good.
You got sparklers?
You sure?
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful.
All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Ok. Wait here.
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check? What the...hey, where you kids from?
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Anybody wanna have a game?
'And with your spirit.'
Salute!!!
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
How do you know?
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.
Nervous?
Yeah.
You flew before?
No.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
And say what?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Panther! Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before. Until you come back.
Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
Not quite...but keep trying.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino! Where have you been?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
Wouldn't bother me.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Listen...I'm a guest here.
I could have told you that.
Cut it out stupid. It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
How?
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No you're not...
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Come on.
I'll be here. Don't worry.
Mind your own business.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
No.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Forget it.
Good idea.
Ok, how's everything going?
No.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
What pipes?
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
OK, get in.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
Let's go to the movies...on you.
He'll be here. Look, take this for now.
Charlie, this is business.
We'll be here.
Yeah, where's the rest?
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I know.
Stripper?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Hostess?
Bye.
Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
No you weren't.
Yes, you did.
Ok.
Oh...around...why?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house. And when he was there...at night...
...The one who's sick, right? In the head.
Yeah. That's what I said, sick in the head.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Do you have enough?
Here.
Well...
I don't mind.
It's all right.
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
What is it now?
Don't ask.
Did you?
No.
A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
Take your time. I don't care.
I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately.
That's the word...preoccupied.
Sure...He lives there?
You're intolerable today.
Watch your language.
Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself. You know that.
I know...I know.
Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
The green capsules in the top drawer.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
But...
The girls like it loud.
Girls? You call those skanks girls?!
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Count it.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat. Your father's?
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
No...no. Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
This is a heisted car!
Of course! A double for Michael, Tony.
Friends of yours Michael.
Shut up.
Quiet please.
Not bad. $20. Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
Thanks.
Ok guys...have a heart. This is my business.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
And isn't it a lovely one? So sturdy, so straight --
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
He's coming.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
He's cute.
Very.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind?
But it's your birthday.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
And you could care less --
A name?
Whew, at last. Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
We've got some things to discuss.
Who?
From the Korean War.
Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.
That's okay, Daddy.
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
Yes, it is.
Okay. All aboard - New York, New York!
He said he would be there with bells on.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
And that?
Pinot Grigio. We're considering it for the appetizer.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Both.
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
You mean this, sir?
How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
Toast? No...just the butter.
Right away.
Hi.
What 'business'?
Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations.
You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got Joe. And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
Yeah. Goodnight.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
He'll wait --
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
Here...
'Here'?
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.
Cold.
And a glass.
"Death and Taxes"?
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I'll make a note of it. Anything else?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No no, not you.
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Me, too.
You have a way with words.
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh -- this is --
Yes.
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Uh -- he's from out of town --
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Glad I could be of some help.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
How nice for you both.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.
Please, Drew.
Sure.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Yours.
Certainly. Goodnight.
I don't think so. Do you?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
Are you running this Board or am I?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I don't think they're ordinary. I love keychains.
Joe, you do get around.
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, that's very interesting.
Yeah. Neat.
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
That's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.
He said that?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Obeah evil. I not evil.
What you then?
I from dat nex' place.
You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
No, no. I on holiday.
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not dis pain. Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can't, sistah.
Can, mistah. Take me to dat nex' place.
Make it time.
None facety, mistah. You come for me? Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Doctor? What could be wrong wit' you?
Nuthin'.
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Don' need you okayin'.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Hi, Jennifer.
Sure.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
No. Nothing.
Nothing?
Jennifer.
Of course, Mr. Parrish. Right away.
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
What?
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Yes?
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Are you?
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
It's so very nice to see you again.
I didn't know that.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Do I? I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh? About what?
Love.
'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
How did you meet?
Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I'm sorry.
I haven't.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
Yes?
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing. Through there.
How nice you look. Is that your uniform?
Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
Yes.
Not now.
Be sorry for nothing.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.
It wasn't an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
And I appreciate you, too.
I don't know.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes...I've found that it does.
I am, too.
Has her pain abated?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
No.
To bed.
'To bed'?
Yes. I'm tired.
Why don't you get off his case?
I said get out.
Please. We don't need to talk about Drew.
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
Why, yes. Thank you.
I don't know who you are.
I am.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Yes, he's tired. I believe so.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Yes!
Nowhere? I'm...here.
For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I love you in an evening gown.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Where are you going?
And you can't tell me who you are.
It gets worse.
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't. That will come later.
Will it?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
But you're not. You're somewhere else. You're someone else --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Hold me --
-- Yes?
Thank you for loving me.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
You think so?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Thank you.
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --
No.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
No.
I won't.
How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Closer than that.
Not at all.
And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you? How're you feeling?
'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
You've got a deal.
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?
Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.
Not this.
I'm not everybody.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
So can I.
No.
Yes.
Are you sad, Bill?
Oh. Okay.
No thank you, Bill. I can manage.
It's all yours.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.
Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
You tell me, Bill.
Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Um -- not right now.
Goodnight.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'm her father!
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
This universe?
And I don't give a shit.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
Yeah.
Good. Tomorrow, after the party.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
I think you heard me, Bill.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Well, they're mine now.
With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
No.
Does she know where she's going?
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
Get him in here.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
He is --
I'll take it from here -- I am --
-- An IRS man.
An offense --
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
Yes.
That's life. What can I tell you?
I am not a dream.
You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?
'...Yes --'
Death!
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do? How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
And then --?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
What?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
I believe you did.
I don't!
Try. Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
Please. Talk to me --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
Know what? Know what, goddammit!
I'm here.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'Take me'...? Where?
Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...
Get what?
Time.
What the hell are you talking about?
Watch it!
I'm sorry --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
What question?
Yes, Bill. The question.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great. You ready?
I am, this is it. B Day.
How's that, Quince?
Yeah. Or the week after.
Yeah, I give a shit.
See. There. What'd I tell you?
The vodka. What'd I tell you?
Sure.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yeah - Bill - How are you? You okay?
Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
Hi, honey.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
Yeah. I guess so.
...Then don't.
You're only six-five once.
Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.
I am. With you.
I know it's none of my business --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Probably.
Uh oh --
What were you going to say?
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.
I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.
I know. But I'm the only father you've got.
He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.
Nothing. I'm sorry.
Nothing.
A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
What?!
-- This morning. The Corinth Coffee Shop. He was looking for a doctor.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Will it?...
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Then what will you say?
Nothing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Then what is it?
It's something.
Joe?
I don't know.
Where's he going?
I don't know, I can't say --
I'm having a helluva time.
I'm sorry.
Yes, but --
That's why it's okay.
Oh, yes --
Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
Not at all. It was fascinating.
Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.
I could be her.
'Her'.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
I would.
You never know. Lightning could strike.
Did I say something wrong?
No, it was so right it scares me.
Because I like you so much. Now I've got to go.
No --
Y'didn't?
But we've got time.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I think I know her.
From what?
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?
That's it.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Condition?
I have no memory.
Amnesia?
What's it like?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up. *
That must suck. All... backwards. *
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
Hi, Leonard.
What?
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Then why is this my handwriting?
When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Why?
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Just two. So far. *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard.
Hi, Leonard.
Yeah?
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
A cop?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say. *
Who did this to you?
You did.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
Interested in buying one?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
I forget.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz? *
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Quiet!
I don't want blood on them.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Strip!
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
Take the money and walk away!
I don't want your fucking money!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You did explain, Lenny.
You told me.
So you have information for me?
Is that what your little note says?
Yes.
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me - *
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sorry.
Don't remember.
You know what we have in common?
Yeah. You?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Yes.
What?
Kill him.
Course not.
Such as?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Just relax.
What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Who did he go to meet?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a * lot of people.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
And?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah?
Yeah, I hated it.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
No!
What's this all about?
I have this condition -
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That's different.
About your whore of a wife?
Why not?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
I remember my wife dying.
What do you want?
A BEER, please.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like * that and order a beer. *
What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Are you Teddy?
My name's Leonard. *
Did Teddy send you?
I don't know.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Then why are you here?
Thank you.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
I enjoy it.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Shut your mouth!
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. * Why are we going there?
I don't remember.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
I'll be waiting. *
You said you were leaving town.
Things change.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Why?
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Probably left it in your room.
No! Should I?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I don't know.
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Give me your keys.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Natalie who?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
From who?
Why not? MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Why?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like what?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I have money.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
How do you know him?
Wouldn't be appropriate. *
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Maybe. Maybe just.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
That, and your thing. *
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
Why? You're never going to know. *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd * remember. But you didn't. *
No. You took them out. *
Why would I do that? *
You can't just take it!

A load of amphetamine I told him I had.

He any good?
Oh, yeah...
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
They may have already, so we protect the living. Proof she's alive?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us. He's grabbed Gina.
Where's the new drop point...?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...

It's a rip and a hit.

Later! Do you dance?
I dance...
No.
I insist.
To mothers. And all that we owe them...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real. Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
That's right.

Exactly.

Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, viejo.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
They're all the same. "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Why?
...to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it. Ask Prudential. Or Allstate.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?

No.
Good. So let's go...
Nothing.
On my way back...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs. Fell back to her place.
Where?
Verdado.
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Havana, Cuba...?
No. Havana, Louisiana. Don't we have a meet?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
There is "undercover." And there is "Which way is up?"
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking. You to me.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
I would never doubt you.
What's the point? It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Too fast. Too many moving parts.
Switek?
Then you should.
If you're down, we're down for the play.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Detective Crockett.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Okay. What's up?
"Buy and walk"? "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"? What?
That's right.
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
NLR, we think. I wanna know...
We don't know.
To recruit you.
A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Never heard of him.
From the North Valle area. New. Low-level, we think.
Haiti and Puerto Rico. Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Have faith.
I have faith. In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Hi, Gina. This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sonny...
Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.
I don't understand...
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Switek pulling this off...? That's not faith; that's delusional...
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes. What's up?
Nothing. Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Bored.
...and thanks for the flowers.
What flowers?
The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Good idea. We'll grab a bite.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Not French registry?
"Future" of...?
Maritime. Jose will fill you in.
You set this up!
They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.
Nicholas said you okay. That's nice. But how I know if you any good?
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is. He try to take tonight's load?
Alonzo...
What...?
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
They lied.
The Statue of Liberty.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
I ain't sleepy.
I know. Scribbage!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Same all around! For my friend, too!
For money.
For money for what?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Oh hell, forget it.
I mean, dammit, where you live?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Whatsa matter now?
What's that supposed to mean?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough? And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
You like it? Take a look.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't need a comb.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Twenty bucks...
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Yeah.
I'm scared.
What of?
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
They gotta be.
Yeah.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I read it.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I'm wet.
You're what?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
What?
What you got me up here for?
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Get outta my way.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Instant V-goddam-D.
You got it.
No. You got it.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Is he all right!
Getchmis...?
...He had a bald skull and...
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
Where?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even twenty.
Twenty months?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
KNOCK IT OFF!
What?
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Ziat!
Billy?
Everything.
Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
How do you like it? Istanbul?
For the money... )
Oh Jesus!
Sure.
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
Sixty?
No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
I'll pay extra
How much?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
Yes. I think so.
Just what?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
How much did you figure to make?
I was just going to sell it to friends. I'm not a pusher, honest.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so.
About as good as it looks.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah. That guy who beat me? I feel stoned.
What did he do?
Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
It's not fair!
Aslan, there...
Seven years...
Hello.
Sit down a moment, Billy. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What do you mean?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Billy! Please!
What do you mean?
Get the... midnight... express.
What's that?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
Yeah.
Yeah!
Jimmy?
Two thirty.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
What? You gotta be joking.
Yeah.
What?
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
What?
I know where it is.
Max - where?
His radio Back of his open, radio...
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Oh shit.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You can't take anything seriously.
You're right.
My passport!
No!
What is it? . . . Billy?
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Take it off! Take it off! ...S'il vous plait?...
Cat, ah! Ayip!
You're ayip!
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
You 'Merican. You don't know.
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Mr. Yesil.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Who?
The lawyer?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Oh Yesil... Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Lady...
Did you hear me? Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Shit.
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
Take a look.
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
What?
Track bunnies. Rats. They're usually around.
Way we came. Take the first tunnel to your right...
And a right.
Right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do. He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
20 minutes. Susan?
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Oh, man, there you go again.
What?
Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Just do it!
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Oh, Jesus!!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
"Mistake"? What's that supposed to...?
It doesn't matter, all right? It's dead.
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
Go!! Just go!!
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. You...
Nino, please...
Scent glands. Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
Across both tracks!!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
No...
Manny...
Please.
You did!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You know what I mean...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Maybe they lied to you.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
So?
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
No such thing, baby.
Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.
Right.
I was just late.
No.
It didn't bite me.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Listen to me: we're getting you out.
Toss the flare down!
How?!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
What-
Just do it!!
Peter-
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
That's why we should do it now.
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
I can. We can do this...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Peter...
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
That's it?
Gross. What is it?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I have no idea. Are you ready?
No shit.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult.
What?
I know. Help me get a sample.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
What do you want to know?
Anything you can tell me might help.
It's right this way.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Sounds good.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
How long...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
It's fine.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
My pleasure.
I'm getting to believe you.
I know how that can be.
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Yes.
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You--fooler...! Did I do good?
C'mere, I'll show you.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
--not fair?
They always cheated like that in cliff-- --chapter plays.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The what?
What?
Nothing.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.
Not even a hint?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh...
A toast?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Well, it certainly says you.
You really think so?
I think you're right.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
It is.
What?
You've been out of your room.
No, I haven't.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Be my guest.
That's disgusting.
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Ahh!!!
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
Oh, I like that tone.
That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
Yes.
He's your client, huh?
Yes, he is.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Maybe you can, Libby.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I'm sure you're right.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is. Very first copy.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
All done, chief..
- right - - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not possible..
From her point of view or mine?
Sean, please..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Where is it?
In the envelope in my pocket. My right.. jacket..pocket..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
I left in a bit of a hurry. I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
How grateful?
Well that depends.
On what.
How do you that.
Magic...
Ahh..
Mmmm.
And my room?
Oh, I am. Later..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up - to spring fever.
I suppose I did.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag? She'd never won a bloody thing.
'Thief in the Night?'
Say no more. I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time. There's been a change of plans.
A change of plans?
Ulrich will be about. He'll look after you.
Lovely.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
It's that time. Go.
More like two-two point two million.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Ninety-three point four million.
It's okay. She scrambled the transmission. Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Then we got'em!
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
I'm not ready!
..in the building...
Right.
Not for seven more minutes.
I hope there's a place to land.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
I am. She is.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes. He's breached the hot zone..
No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.
No. Just as if I'd like to.
Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
I see. You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
- torque wrench.
- this is very disconerting..
Hey, you put me here. I just do what I'm told.
- right..
Do what?
Not really. I triggered the alarm..
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?
Where did you get this number? I don't even have it!
Listen to what?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Your help? What are you talking about?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.
Oh bloody hell. You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Who wants to be decent?..
Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
That they're lying.
Of what?
Damn, you're beautiful.
That's because I'm on my back.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I. But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide?
Something like that.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
Oh, I do. But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Yes?
You'll be fine. I'm going to lose you.
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Affirmative.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'll muddle through.
You noticed. What're you going to do? Spank me?
Why? What's happened. What did you see?
Oh Ethan!..
I am now. Get me out of here. Just get me out of here.
I wasn't thinking! Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No. You just looked as if you did.
No...
Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You gotta be kidding.
Like?
What did you think of him?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Excuse me?
You mean it'll be difficult.
Very.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
I don't. No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
They're ready and waiting. You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
You keep calling me Dmitri. You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual. The visuals aren't coming up.
Why not?
Yep.
Roger that.
Confirm. Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back. There's an enveloped inside --
I told her to get outta there.
Nyah still on the property?
No garage entrance. Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion. Alarm in cosmetics.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs. One klick away.
Copy. She's only got twenty-eight minutes left. Track ahead and pick her up.
Good job. And thanks.
What's happening here? You're dead!
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
Do I?
You took it! All of it! And what if I need it?
They'll kill me.
You're right, of course.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
S.O.P..
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
I dont know. It didnt say on the tickets.
This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
All ten million.
Fold it. Fold it tight.
Always.
May take a little time.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
We got it. On your feet.
I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk. Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Roger that.
Don't move.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
What?
Take off your God damn coat!
I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.
That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
What kind of help?
Sure...
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Bastard!
I sent the message to Max. Were on for tomorrow.
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther?
Two cars. Where are you?
You are my eyes. Stay with him.
Ethan?
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
I always have, Claire..
Go secure.
Theyre dead.
Whos dead?
My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
They knew we were coming. Golitsyns dead too. The disk is gone.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Do you read me? <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>. Are you clean?
Yes.
Location green. One hour. Ill be there myself.
Youre in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Dont disappoint me.
No sir.
One hour.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
Yes. I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
I don't quite follow you.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
What kind?
Profitable.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
What makes you trust me?
I'll get you close.
About what?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
On what?
Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC. Was. <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Why should I?
Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up first.
It doesnt, dear girl. as long as you tell me where the money is.
I wouldnt worry about him. Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Let's move!
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
We'll see.
Time up.
We're not outta here yet.
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Always.
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Give me a break, Pops.
Roger that. Opening doors now.
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.
Right, right. Good.
What about my coat? I'll freeze.
Jim. Jim. Hes in the open.
Jim we cant.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
No, were going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move!
Why?
You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Very well.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
I guess.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Why not?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Can you lose him?
No. Abort.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
I remember..
Yeah.
How did Kittridge do it?..
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague. The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security. No guns. Real plus.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
Youre wrong about one thing. Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Doesn't mean it's a signal. Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Twenty minutes.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
Its not working.
Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I always check the batteries.
Run it through from the top.
Phew! Weve got five minutes...
No, I'm going.
The Shawfish?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Uh-huh
And I'll have the special fish.
Very good.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Why you drinking so much?
What?
You're welcome.
I'm going to bed now.
His brother.
Yes.
I want you to stop seeing her.
And go to confession.
No. You were there.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I don't know what you mean.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You haven't said anything.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Pop, I got news.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
I won't come.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
It's temporary.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Let's go tell your Mother.
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're married.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You're my father.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
I brought you something.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I like your dress. It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
Good morning, Lucy.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Let me come and talk to you.
Yes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Excuse me.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
I don't understand.
Maybe I should come back another time.
That's it.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
I know that. I do what I want.
I like it well done.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Yesterday.
Why what?
I don't know.
Stupid.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Why you talking to me?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
You think so?
Yes.
You really are stupid, you know that.
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
No!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Because I have no Luck!
A bride without a head!
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
Me neither.
I was dead.
I was dead, too.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What about Johnny?
That light.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
I've never seen a moon like that.
It makes you look like an angel.
What?
Take it easy.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Don't just become excited.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh no I didn't!
Why not?
I'm in love with you!
I can't!
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I thought I'd try it. You look good.
Thank you.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in.
For what?
Come on.
It's the best thing there is.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
I think that's it.
I wanna go home.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I know what I know.
I'm here!
You're late!
We're here.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
And you're not now?
No.
Let me go home.
No.
I'm freezing to death.
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
Good! We can get this out on the table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Ronny, please...
No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What!
Will you marry me.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Right.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
You? No.
Johnny.
No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Maybe you're right.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
Yeah.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
We should talk alone.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
If I marry you my mother will die.
I must ask for that back.
Where's the ring?
Pop.
No.
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
And we'll sell the house.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Did he tell her?
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat. Where's that card?
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What's the matter with him?
Did you see it?
No.
Oh.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
You should think about this.
I know.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Talk to him.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Did you see the moon last night?
I came right from the airport.
Come on in.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
Yes.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
Yes.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
No idea.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Okay, I'll tell her.
Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Definitely!
Sure!
Do you have a girlfriend?
I am alone in the world.
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Are you sure?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
Nerves.
I think it's because they fear death.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
People home.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night.
Sure.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
Well. That explains it.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Cosmo.
What would he be doing down there?
I don't know.
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You see that moon last night?
Oh. Right.
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Bring her forward.
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
...What?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Through ... We found them.
Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
What do you mean?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all. They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Am I right?
I'm not interested.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
What?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Who are they?
Oh!
NI! NI!
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right! What do you want?
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
Ni! Ni! Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done!
What, "is"?
No, no ... not "is"!
What?
None shall pass.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I move for no man.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch? Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Come on you pansy!
Come on then.
What?
Had enough?
You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left.
Course I have.
Look!
What! Just a flesh wound.
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
I'll have your leg.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I'm invincible!
You're a looney.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
Come, Patsy.
'Allo. Whoo is eet?
Of course not! You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
I'm French. Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege ... forgive me ...
Bedevere, my Liege.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
No! Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
| It's not working. You're not doing it properly. Ni!
Ni!
That's it. Ni! Ni!
No. No. No!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Yes, my liege. Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do. You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
A G...g...g...
A Grail?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Follow!
What?
There he is!
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
You got us all worked up.
I warned you!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Charge!
Who did we lose?
Man!
Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
What?
:Well - I can't just say: "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Yes, I see.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Be quiet! I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Shut up!
Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.
Come on, patsy.
Course it's a good idea.
... Well, we did do the nose.
The nose?
And the hat. But she is a witch.
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
I'm not dead!
I'm getting better!
You're not. You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
Do me a favour.
You're not fooling anyone you know. Isn't there anything you could do?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
Right. Off you go.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I don't know that!
Here's one!
Ninepence.
Yes he is.
I can't take him.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today.
When's your next round?
Thursday.
That's all right. See you on Thursday.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
And another!
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Farewell, Concorde!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Yes ... I'm very sorry ...
They cost fifty pounds each!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
Gosh - Is he all right?
Is it?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
What - the curtains?
Father, lad.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Rather what?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Listen, Alice ...
Herbert.
Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on!
I'm ... your son ...
Not you.
Shut up! You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
I was saved at the last minute.
How?
Well ... I'll tell you ...
... and you'll come and get him.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Got it?
Yes?
If we ... er ...
Look, it's simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
Okay. Fine. We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Yes ... make sure ...
We're coming with you.
The what? But you are tired and you must rest awhile. Midget! Crapper!
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot But come.
Sir Galahad!!
No, It's nothing!
You must see the doctors immediately. You must lie down.
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
You are in great peril.
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
No, really, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily!
I don't think I was.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.
No. It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
No, I'm not.
Ector.
They're doctors?
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
Back to your bed! At once!
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Don't say that word.
Stop saying the word! The word we cannot hear! The word ...
Stop saying it. AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
You've said it! Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Look. I'm warning you.
What's he do? Nibble your bum?
Shut up.
Shut up. Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I didn't.
Bravely ran away, away.
No, no, no.
So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
She loved him.
Come on, man. There's love and there's ...
What?
You know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
The good-looking one.
Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you.
She means it.
Get out. Out!
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
I hope to go up next year.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Good man. And is she all right?
Yeah.
Are you all right, Barney?
Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Of course.
I beg your pardon? Mama...?
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
The future King!
Out of my way!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Cold is good-- Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
By whose authority?
My own.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
That's not good enough.
Aye, do.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Yes. I do.
I beg your pardon?
Is that the Queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
It can wait. Anything else?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
Oh.
This is the top.
Surely --
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
But yourself? What about John Brown?
I said. I serve the Queen.
No other aspiration?
Why do you think I keep her here?
She trusts you, John.
See what?
The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Yes. That will be company for you.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
He thought so, yes.
Aye, ma'am.
Yes.
What?
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Craobhan-geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
That doesn't make him an expert.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Ah, well...
To keep out the cold.
Aye.
I heard something.
I ordered it. It's for your own safety.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Because I have to!
Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was before.
Yes. Yes it was.
Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time.
I came as quickly as I could.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
No, ma'am.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
We'll see which way the wind blows.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
No, she wasn't.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Dear oh dear.
We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
Quite. I think I'd best take it back.
Of course.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky.
No, indeed.
Whom?
Cold is good!
Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
How ill is he?
Just them?
Yes, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
I believe not, ma'am. I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
A few days, ma'am.
Why was I not told earlier?
Of course, at once.
And now I am back.
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
Why not?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Sure.
Yeah, who isn't.
Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Maybe he's not dead.
He?
The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
You don't like it?
Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
He's probably outside. You know how he is. Gets bored...
Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Actually, no. I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Guess he took off... You have his keys, right?
Yeah...
So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...
But he was playing the game. I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
Have you played the game yet? It's incredible! I was just...
We are talking...
No, in person. Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm coming over.
Funny.
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
You imagined it.
No it didn't. It's just a faulty relay or something. It happens.
Call the others. Laurie, Benz...
It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them.
All of them?
No way.
If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick.
She thought Benz was at school.
Laurie's.
Let's go around back.
What?!
We can't...
My house. I want to try something.
What?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
It's already out.
The Police, then...
I don't know.
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
No I'm not...
Get that helmet. If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
I can't believe you made it!
Everything.
Yeah. The Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
It can turn itself on, Alex! It doesn't need a quarter.
Yes I am...
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I know. It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One. In case...
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
There...
Check your read-out.
What?! There's nothing here!
Look around...
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?
I don't want to talk about it.
There never is.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
Good. Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Sure. Never come back. Disappear forever.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Yes...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
Is that your question?
Wait! No! That's not it!
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
I miss you so much, Alex. I want so much to be with you...
Not yet, honey...
Is it? Why don't you see for your self?
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
Fucked up. That's what they said I was.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Of course I can. I can say all sorts of things...
I am the Truth Teller. Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
I am giving her a chance. Why don't you get off my back?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I'm going home.
I know. Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
The Cowboy??
It's been a very strange day.
Will you meet with him?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
You're an understandin' fella.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
How... how'd they know I was here?
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Well, I ...
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
You got it! See you later honey.
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Right. See ya.
Good luck, honey!
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Are you okay?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
What?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
But you won't.
Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
May I have your name please?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
You don't remember anything else?
Unh, unh.
Mulholland Drive?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Not that I can see.
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
I'm not sure about this.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"So... surprise"...
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"But you won't..."
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
No... but...
Keep going. Go around to the back.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
No.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Wally Brown.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yes, Sir.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Yeah, what for?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Right then.
Yeah.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Oh yeah.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Interesting.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Making ends meet, huh.
Hardly.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
Not a coke or anything?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Sure.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Pick with expediency !
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
No !
Why should I ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I don't know.
We wait. This is an elevator.
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
First Bank ? But how ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
McCay knows ?
I'm leaving.
What ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Great...
The Brooklyn Bridge.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.
That's a shame.
Yeah a real shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Bye....
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey , Hey !
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Just shut the fuck up.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
I don't help criminals.
Not quite....
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Why ?
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
Look...
What the fuck are you talking about.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Ow...
Thanks...
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Where ?
Don't have to tell me twice.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
Don't eat at the console.
What ? Are you my mother ?
Not yet.
But, he's...
I said NO.
Got it.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I just want to double check the facts.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Checking........
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division.
Excuse me, sir ?
Of course.
I am thirty two.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
John, sir.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Good, sir.
Better, sir.
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning. First.... thing...
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
I'm listening.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
What ?????
I don't know.....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
We can't afford too many surprises.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I'll see that bet.
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
You're paying the bills.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
I can see that but where ?
<<belch>>
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I think I'll see hat action.
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
How can this happen ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
Thank you.
I meant him.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Sure.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Shut up ! It's me.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
What ?
Nothing.
Zach from work ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Where are we ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Ohhhhh.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
You're Vada right?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Don't mention it.
I don't even know your name.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
Me, I'll know!
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup. Monday.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Could you hold on for a second?
Dad, I'm trying. The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Great.
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
I already bought a ticket.
What??
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
I will. How's Shelly?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Give my love to Shelly.
She just had a baby that's all.
We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Can I see him?
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
No.
You're being narrow-minded.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Oh. Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I've got something better.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Well...
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
oh.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
ehh...I don't know I mean....
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Rose.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Happy hunting.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
My mother.
Your mother?
I never met my mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
You're so clever.
You're over reacting!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
MOM!
No THANKS!
He said it was a gift.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
TAXI!!!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
WHAT??
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
What difference does it make?
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
Change my name.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
I think it's cool.
You would.
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Does it work?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Owh...
Oh no?!?!?!
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws. My hands fit.
Big deal.
What do you think?
Really?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
He's an undertaker.
Yeah?
This has been a real confusing day.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
An adventure?
Part adventure...part miracle.
I'll write you ten poems. Bye.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Wow!
You're a good man Nicholas.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Was Rose.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a 5 note
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed?
Committed.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Yes, it does.
Bye.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
This is it I guess.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
I should do this myself.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Okay.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Phil for God sake.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
Is that a yes?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Excuse me?
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn't?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
What do you mean?
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
I know, look at his little hands.
You have no idea.
O.K.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Do you know him?
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Vada!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Good for you baby.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
You're such a baby.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook, Gimme the goddam keys.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
What?
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Yeah, all right...
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Yes.
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
No.
It's there.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
What Hurts Vada?
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I think it's still available.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Pardon?
I need the job.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Yeah.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm. Fix it.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
No kidding?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
It's no big deal.
No. Just, more activity.
What's that?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
Are you mad at me?
No, why?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Did she ever see Vada?
Here?
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
Good.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'm looking forward to that.
Okay.
I'll second that.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
You can get the general idea...
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Perfect.
I don't know which ball's mine.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Is it for a child?
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Any more soda left?
I love this guy!
Dad??
What?
The money?
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Why?
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
Sorry.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
There were just too many of 'em.
Get away, get away!!
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
No, no.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
In the garage.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
I'm very nervous.
Why?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, no no....
Hi, is Vada home?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well, you never can tell... I might get a pet.
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Please.
Come here, sit down over here.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
That's Suzanne. She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
We'd love to hear it.
Oh yes, yes.
Do you think she is?
No.
Why do you think she says that?
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Why?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Yes it is.
That's really cool.
Oh.
I am.
Chocolate?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Come on sweetie.
Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
I would.
Thomas?
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Okay.
No.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Come here, sit down.
Aarrggh.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Oh great!!
Yes!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Okay, get in to bed.
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Liverpool?
They're just fun to read.
What are you saving for?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got something!
Oh no! UUH.
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It's a mosquito bite.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
Okay, OW!
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Where's your bike?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Never mind.
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
What?
Heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pacifist!
I am not.
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Duck!
Go???
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
What?
HEY YOU!!!! I'm gonna get you!!! I'll get you!!!!
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
So?
Stand back.
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I am running faster!!
Hurry!!!
But I have my clothes on!
Do it!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Sure.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Bye Ma.
I wanna live with them too.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
They're getting married?
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Okay, seeya.
I dunno..
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
It is not.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
But, I don't know how.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay.
Okay, seeya. Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
For what?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I should look different.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Well, I'm close to her. I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
I honestly wish I could...
Part of being a New Yorker.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... weeks.
No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight.
Desperate. To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
I can see why.
Chill? Since when do you say ch...
When I'm talking to children.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Impressive.
Let's not get carried away.
I KNOW THAT! I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
Major. Dish.
Manicure...
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
To belong to someone.
Good girl.
Oh, you're more than okay.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
I can be quick. I can even be funny.
Can you watch the road?
See. Dry. It's in the delivery.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Uh. How about promoting a bridesmaid? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Not you. You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...?
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile. I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
... except one.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
I've missed a step.
He has you on a pedestal. And me in his arms.
Ju...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that. I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am. Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
Exactly.
Exactly what?
What you said. Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Only. If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
I love him.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
That's entirely understandable.
... look good on Kimberly.
Right. And then it didn't want to come off. Exactly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey. Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I hope so. This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring. I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has. So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
You don't understand. I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
You've met her parents.
I need you.
W...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Mirrors.
Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance??
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
What's next?
My very point. Here's another one...
Quite the little eccentric.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
First girl I ever knew. Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Till the gas ran out.
Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
I got the point.
That would be a girl. I don't even know.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Boy, those were the days.
Never can tell.
Michael!!
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No. I've got you.
If you like.
Have you.
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for that.
Me either.
I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
We danced to it. Just like this.
Well.
Yes.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!!
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
It means a lot.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
A bad combination.
I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Get married, apparently.
And your point?
Well. How come she didn't...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
She admits it's her fault.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Well, it happens.
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
To the twins' soiree? So they can paw you and drool...?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
MICHAEL!!
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
An so it is.
You're much more his type.
Right here.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Well, it better not happen again.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What do you have to buy?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Hi! Star.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I won first prize.
Come on.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Is there food?
No.
What's wrong honey.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
All those people...
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
You'll have to speak up.
Eater says she doesn't see how you do it.
What's wrong with her.
Green.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I got them right here.
Bye, Bye.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Okay. Thanks.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Whose word?
His Word.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
I said 'no!'
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Your job, huh.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
What!
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Okay.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
Hal Phillip Walker.
President.
ABC.
How much?
Minimum.
D.C.
D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?
Sure thing.
Okay.
Stop it!
When is it?
How come?
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Where the hell have you been?
To the bathroom.
It's the den mother.
National?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
What crook?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
She's in Paris.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Not yet.
Let me know when you do, all right?
I'll just be in here.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Harvard?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
What is a turkey shoot.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Sure he will.
Ester and me did; My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
That's good, I've never seen anything so healthy.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
I think we can do that. Come in.
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Good night,
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
I'1l get your bag.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
That Tom sure is cute.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
How do you know?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
No.
She had on high heels?
No.
Need a ride?
No.
You got a place to stay?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
No.
Get in.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Sixty-three.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I don't know his first name.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Fungus?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I don't think so.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
How do you know if they do?
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
And before?
No, I don't.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.
Who is this? It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
What do you mean? You said you wanted to see me.
Wow!
What?
Who is this, right? I called you last night.
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Doesn't it have a name?
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Wrong.
I have to go. He sighs.
I know.
I can't.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Oh.
Older.
Thirty?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Older than thirty?
That's unkind.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
That's what you said before.
I know. Goodbye.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
Oh.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
What?
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
Yea.
I see.
They said go see the chaplain.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Linnea?
Yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
It's me. What is it?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...? Courtland wants to...
What time?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I'll be there.
How much?
Hundreds of times.
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
He's pretty well known down here.
For him?
Yes.
You're real favorites of his.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
An album.
Might be good for you.
What!
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
Out.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh?
I mean...
Mary?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
Just a minute.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Why?
What?
What? Oh. A film.
Where is she?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You go to school together?
No, we never did that
Oh --
You do?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Where are you from?
Southern California.
You always live there?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Ryan O'Neal.
You really do? ~ God -- How come you know them?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You serious?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
You think it will?
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
More or less...
What was the color of Tim's belt?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Yes, they were.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
You got something you want to do?
Yeah.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
You been followin' the news coverage?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Susanville, Soledade.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You've heard of it?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Ain't love grand.
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now. All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
She was born without a tongue.
Oh my God! Sorry.
What?
Anything.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
Yes, sir.
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
It's video.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
I'm keen with anticipation.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Let's do it.
Aside from the obvious?
Was what worth it?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Let me have the keys.
No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
We'll all be killed.
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
So, what now?
NO!!!
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
No fuckin' way!
Mickey, you're wasting time!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Yes.
Unfortunately, yes.
I do, too.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Survival of the fittest.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Here.
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, no.
Wayne---
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Wayne Gayle.
Wayne Gayle!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
How 'bout Mallory?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Yeah, sure.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Tomorrow.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Perfecto!
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Super cool. This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
They're mesmerising.
Why?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How so?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Ya know, I was.
Really?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
It sure is.
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Two guys?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Three.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Fine. Julie, why don't you make a food run? What's around here?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Yeah.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
What d'you say, Duff?
You think so, Frankie?
Hell, you got steady work.
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
Okay.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
You' new here, man! See you, boys.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
Anderson.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I don't know. He's your boy.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
Make sure he gets those shots.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
I don't know.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Thanks.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess I don't.
Just so you do your work.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Guess so.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
I don't know.
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me. Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay, thanks very much.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Okay.
Cup of coffee. I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I been there.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Okay, I will.
You must be new in town.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
No. My mother's dead. You goin' back inside?
Yes, aren't you?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
My father's the preacher.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
That's right.
What d'you expect?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How d'you mean?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
No.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
No thanks.
Go on - you can have one!
What is it?
That's right.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
How d'you mean?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Good night, Duff.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
'Been up north?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
What d'you mean?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
No, I ain't married. Well, good-bye.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
I'll see you later.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
Four.
What's he like?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
What?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
What about that girl?
Well, what d'you think?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
Don't call them that.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
He could live with us.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Yeah, that's so.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Come here, baby.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You still didn't answer my question.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
Huh?
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
Well, I haven't come around.
We'll be all right.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
We can always do that, Duff.
Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you?
About ten dollars.
Yeah!
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
There's nothing to say.
Well, that'll be the first time.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What 'you signifyin'?
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah, see you in hell.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's right.
Okay.
Workin' a saw mill. Here's to.
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Great.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
That's right.
Beat it!
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Okay.
No, thanks.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
She'll do.
Sorry.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Going back, huh?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
Okay.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
Good-bye, Duff.
How are you?
All right, son.
Guess it's never been easy.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Thank you.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
It's for your own good.
I'll be seeing you.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
How you doin'? Hi there!
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is that right? Think you're gonna make it with her?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Hi.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
No. Why?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Shut up, Will.
You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Better now. Where 'you at?
Right here.
Anything you say, baby.
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes. And sometimes I don't-- Shut the fuck up!
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Omar--
No more goddamn talking! I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Enough talking! We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man. My throat's fucking raw!
Since when?
Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
I'm fine.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Don't play with me.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Of course...
The Elders, mon...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
What?
And how do you suggest I do that?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Good, because you've got a new one.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
What are you talking about?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What's he doing to my gear?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?
No, but it traced me.
What about McCoy?
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Linked?
You see the couple up in the balcony?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.
What are you talking about?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I find out now.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Can you read my mind?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
The words?
The access code to your mainframe.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
I don't have a girl.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Yeah.
It's Case. Remember me?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
All things possible in Babylon.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
Right...
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
No problem, amigo.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
How are we doing?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
We got problems topside.
What are you talkin' about?
How's the ice break?
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Less than thirty minutes.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
How's the ice?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
It's coming.
You haven't got it?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
Case.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable. Anyone like a taste?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
What?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
No!... No...
I thought you already left.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I don't know. I don't know...
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
And Linda...
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I think you're full of shit.
Why should I want to meet him.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Couple of months.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
Almost two days.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Go ahead...
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
So you're a wire junkie.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Case...
Shhh...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Yeah.
They'll cut you down.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Something exotic I hope.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
What went down between you and Riviera?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
No we don't...
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
What is it?
Hold on.
What?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What are you talking about?
Shut up.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Well, do you?
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Thanks.
Sure. No problem.
Petty good.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, it's lame.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
 uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
I'm late for lab.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
If you say so.
Right. Right.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
You stood for like a month.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
That is lingerie.
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Anita!
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Betty.
Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
OUT!
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Good.
I can't do this.
Rob. Please focus.
Little known fact.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
That's the spirit!
No. Josie, this is real.
And a gymnast!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
I know.
Really?
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Oh I don't think so.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Don't look down!
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
Nah uh.
We're very evolved.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Duh.
Well, a ball player.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
<i> I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Everybody knows about--
Barrel.
<i> Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i> Three of a kind...</i>
We can handle it.
And heavy...
Where?
For this.
Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Yes.
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now. I have to leave some time.
I know.
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.
Good. I'm hungry.
Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about?
But why? It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Taste it.
No.
Why not?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
He stayed a long time.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Experiments?
Specifically.
<i> Now and forever...</i>
<i> Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
It's getting there.
Don't be a smart ass.
Who's Lisa?
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
No. Upstairs.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
What are you talking about?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...
Ken!
Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse's dead, Lisa. Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He's dead, you bitch.
He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.
What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.
Not too far. My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Only the wet ones.
Shut up, Grady.
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
It's happening again.
How come?
Ah, nothing.
Look at this car. Are you kidding?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah?
Uh-uh. Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
World History. But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Who?
I don't know.
I just got here myself. Went to the Public Library. Cut four classes!
Research. Hi. C'mon, let's go for a ride.
You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Make a left at this corner.
It's a surprise.
What's this?
What do you mean?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
C'mon, cut it out.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing.
Shhh. Just concentrate.
Uh-uh. Wait...
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
I'll get over it.
Whoa!
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk about it?
I'm not hungry.
Why won't you talk to me?
Will you leave me alone? Please.
I killed him! I killed him!
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
Who? Who's doing this to you?
Hi.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Eggs?
You okay?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
No. I'm okay.
Sure...go ahead.
I'm okay. Just leave me alone.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Fine.
Hi, Kerry.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there?
All of them.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
You're going out?
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'm serious.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I'll need to take her things.
The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
I'll get it. Please, I don't mind.
First door up the stairs.
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me. What are you still doing up? It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired. Really.
Kristen, don't start with me. You know what your shrink said...
He's full of shit.
That's right. I don't.
Mom?
What are you still doing up? It's past one.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
I had such an awful dream.
Can't it wait till morning?
Please Mom? I just don't want to be alone.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Don't hold your breath.
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Oh, right. You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Jennifer --
Just tonight, please? I can't handle the nightmare. Not tonight. Not after Phillip.
Deal. Thanks.
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us. We're not in the mood.
Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone.
No fuckin' way. We're a team.
He's close...
To old friends.
Do you still...see each other?
Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.
I -- I think so!
He's real.
Sure.
I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
You did it the other night.
That was different.
He's heavy in the halls...
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
He's too strong! He was never this strong!
They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.
Let's try this way.
I think so.
I'm so proud of you all. Tell Neil I...
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty. Trimble's sick.
So?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
What?
The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.
I don't do that shit.
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Fuck off.
A little basic, but nice.
Why is that?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Restless. Very restless.
Thanks, Max.
It'll be my last chance. Pleese?
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max. We need all the help we can get.
It's been a long time.
You know what he did. He's doing it again.
Nancy...
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told. Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion. I've got to get going.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Didn't get much sleep.
Well, we've got --
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was. Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
I'm serious.
That's what I know.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
All right. Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
We're gonna try.
Doesn't matter.
C'mon. Let's get out of this rain.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Remember -- open mind.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Everybody take five.
Anything?
There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands.
I've heard crazier things this week.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
I'll be okay. Just give me a minute.
Just go. Kristen needs you. Keep her awake somehow. Do it.
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Sshhh. No time for that. Come on.
What about Kristen?
We can't get to her. I've tried.
The by-product of guilt. Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You can't! They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
What are you talking about?
You're about to attend a funeral. One that's long overdue.
What?
Listen.
No. We're alone.
A sad choice.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort. I've seen you before. Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I come from time to time. When I'm needed.
That girl was Amanda Krueger. Her child --
Freddy.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you? Listen to them.
Accident my ass. I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count. You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
C'mon.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Yeah? What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Me too.
Hi. Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh God.
And you. I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.
I'm delighted.
Now you're lying.
You're right. I told you I was bad at acting.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to. I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm not listening.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I'm an actress.
Fine.
Yes. This one though is... very good.
Here, let me help.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes. Well. My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Thanks. Well...
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
Yes.
Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
If that's all right.
Okay.
It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
Ahm...
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
Uh-oh. That's not good.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
Why?
I think goodbye is traditional.
Come in.
This is the place.
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over. Basic plot?
'Thank you.' How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes. Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No. What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.
Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Okay.
What?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Oh.
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Don't ask.
Undressed like this, yes.
Jesus.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
Excuse me?
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Thank you. Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
And what would you say...
That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Crazy. Go along Bayswater...
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
Oh God. Oh God. Oh Goddy God.
No!
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
Right.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Me?
Yes. What do you think?
Well, yes. Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
It was good.
It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
How you doing? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Right.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
I'm sorry. I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford.
Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Who? Someone famous?
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
She's perfect, perfect.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
So not over her, in fact.
Great. Excellent. Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no. She doesn't.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Well... wait for it... First there's this one...
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more.
Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
Good luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two? That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
No, 'fraid not.
Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
You're welcome. Did you find them?
Sort of.
Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Three.
Yes.
Oh. Right.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Mister Sefelt?
Y-y-y-yes...
Tell us about it...
I was in luh-love with her.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
I-I-I...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
No! No! No!
Mister Washington.
Mister McMurphy!
Will you come with me, please.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am. Lead the way, Sam.
Sorry, ma'am.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
I wanna report a robbery!
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
What for?
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right!
Go on...
Yeah?
No way.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
So do I!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
No, it was irresponsible!
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
B-B-Billy.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
O-o-o-oh...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Shhh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Go ahead! Go back!
Yeah, kid?
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Marry who?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
M-M-M-Mack?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Thank you.
God Bless America.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
No.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Lend me twenty.
Atta boy, Cheswick!
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Yeah, Mack?
Come here!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Sure, Mack...
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Shhh...
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Right, Mack!
Yeah!
Hey, what's that?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.

Shhh...
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Through the ass.
Me, too...
Me too...
My feet hurt...
Lemme see...
What?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That!
Now, what would I be trying to say?
With your own two hands?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Okay, sucker.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Just warmin' up.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
It doesn't help him.
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I refuse!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Scanlon out!
Sure, Mack...
No!
Let me see your hand!
No!
No!
Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Gary Blinker...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
That's a dime, Martini.
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
That's twenty up, Martini. Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. What?
A nickel.
Yeah, Mac?
Bye-bye.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
Yeah, it's cold!
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He's not!
He is!
Hold it!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Poker!
I see.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
In what way?
Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
That's correct, Doc ...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Good. Good.
I'm afraid not.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
When?
We'll let you know.
Time out!
Time out!
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
All I'm askin' is...
What's the horse pill for, honey?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Shhh!
Are you a doctor?
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
All right!
You're on!
What's going on?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
You're on. Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Shhh! This way!
Sure...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
That right?
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Martini out!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
'Kay...
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Come an' see.
You's better believe it, brother!
Okay. How you doing?
Just great! See ya around!
Fine, thank you. Here, please take these.
What are they?
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu. In here, please.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
No...
Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
Oh, yeah...
Yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Potential assaultive.
Big man!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
On what?
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
I don't have any.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am...
I'm sure you will.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Oh...
After you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Tha's your problem.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Huh?
Asshole.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
At this hour?
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Yes, ma'am...
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Yes, ma'am...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
What's that?
What?
That!
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Yes, but... He was having an affair.
Si.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
It was late in arriving. But it's here now.
Buona notte.
I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Why?
Because.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What's she doing?
What for?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Yes.
Your hair... is perfect.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Let's find a telephone.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes. We did.
It's alright... this is our destiny.
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
What is it?
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
What great aunt?
Oh no. Do you?
No.
No...
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Sa dov'e' lui?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
Wait. I have to write this down.
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Please, Larry. I have to hurry.
But Faith--
What?...
Hi there...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non. Please.
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
Who's this?
This is his fiancee. Who's this?
I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
Right. Thanks a lot. And congratulations. It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm at the airport. Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Well, he'd have to hurry. My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Oh, come on... What kind of an excuse is that?
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay? You want some help?
NO.
You are leaving, aren't you?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
What?
So it wasn't real.
Because. I know where he is.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please. I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
NO.
Hi.
You found him. I don't know how to thank you.
Yeah.
Well, good. Good for you.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing fancy.
You too.
What?
Nice dress.
Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty. What is that?
The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops. Season tickets.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No. Course not.
Hi. Are you... busy?
No. Are you're leaving?
No. I just came by to apologize.
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
What?
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
No, it isn't. I called off my wedding all because of you.
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
You would? Really?
Okay. Good. See you then, then.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really...
And more...
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it. You're my guest.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp? I like shrimp.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times. It's kind of an annual tradi--
What?
Let's face it. You want me.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
No. He smokes.
How about the other one? His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know. I don't think so.
So?...
So, he's not my type. Let me walk you to the elevator.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Why don't you ask him?
Yes you did.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know... It was.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
No... I can just tell.
It's a coincidence.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
My God, you have...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Maybe.
You're coming with me?
What?
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Well, we're here. And more importantly, he's here. We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
We lost him?...
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying. What's the airport number?
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Oh. Right.
What is it?
A phone message. Only--
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
What was I gonna do? Tell him the truth?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Sorry.
'Course he does.
Polo.
Right. My brother.
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
Oh my God. Where?
Nope.
What?
Good luck.
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly. How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Men have ways.
Hi. Where've you been?
Sightseeing... What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
A little bad luck?
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
What?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes. Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes. He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
When you could've found one in America.
So. I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Uh huh.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Oh.
What about Larry?
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.
A porco?
A pig! A pig! She's saying he's a pig.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh.
What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...
I thank you.
But I do want to.
Huh?
That's exactly what you are.
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
You said it differently then.
What? You know him?
He missed me.
Faith. Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Where is she?
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
Sorry...
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
That's all. Next witness!
Gimme.
Why should he forget it?
I'm not thirsty.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Then don't.
But my own kid bro
That was the idea.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
In a minute.
It's a living.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
That's right... .
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Mmhmmm.
Maybe.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Hello, Edie.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Tommy, what happened?
Terry... Terry... .
Give it to me my Pop's job
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
I better see you get there.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I better get home.
You training to be a nun or something?
I want to be a teacher.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Do you like pigeons?
I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Good. So do I.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning.
That was nice of you.
How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
I don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
I am?
How do you like it?
It's quite nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners.
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really believe that drool?
Terry!
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Yeah, yeah... . This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
But a priest...?
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I got my whole life to drink.
What for?
For not being any help?
That goes double for me.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Go ahead, wear it.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
You?
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Edie it's
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Edie, Edie, I...
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me. Charley?
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Thanks just the same.
Well, it's over.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Are you sure they're your friends?
He's going to have to grow up too.
My pigeons... .
Terry...?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop!
Let me by.
I don't get it!
I'll find you a priest.
About Edie?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You go to
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I can? Okay. Okay...
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
But you still hold out for silence?
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
Down to the wire?
So help me God!
What about it?
Our identification.
Take it easy.
What?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I think you could have.
Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah, really!
Sure... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Doyle. Joey Doyle's... .? ... .You're his... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Be sure they got enough water.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Looking for me?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
No.
No?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Hit me again.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
Easy. Easy, boy.
First things first.
Hey look-
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Gimme.
So-so, Johnny.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
My favorite little cousin.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
By way of Chicago?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
He don't, huh? Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
How'd you get that.
I got it. Hot off the press.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'?
What do you mean?
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Not that free.
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Maybe I will one of these days.
One of these days.
..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
I do not joke in my proposal.
No. It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
Okay.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead? In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not. I hate you!
That sudden?
Maybe so.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
You love me then?
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
Her dance has pleased me.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
As you wish, Master
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Well then let us proceed.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
There is yet time. Don't you want your own pleasure?
Oh, if there is only time!
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master! Thank you.
Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaaahhhh.
Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
Yes, sir, Master.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
What do you suppose for?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Without the snake, of course.
Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
What's free about it? I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What're you talking about?
Yeah, that's him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry. Wrong number.
Who is it?
What?!
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
Tell me, how do you do that?
From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with Glenn.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did? I don't remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk?
Who are you?
Thank you.
Yes.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Listen to me. I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize him without his rug.
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Oh, man.
Sounds great.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
You better come see this.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
I saw Karen Sisco.
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You know how I felt about her.
Yeah, I did.
I get that feeling, yeah.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
Stay with the maid. I'm gonna have a look around.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi. Nice house.
They sure do.
Shit.
What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel. Listen --
Where are you? I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her. That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Now. What is it you wanted to tell me?
Good. Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
The manager's door is metal.
What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Wait. You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
Excuse me, Adele?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Who?
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah.
Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
I bet. How much?
Another C.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I thought everything.
You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind.
I wasn't asking permission.
Hey. You learn from doing.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Someone down here?
Not until recently.
Nervous?
A little.
If I could have a little more room.
In my bag, in the car.
I believe it. You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
One I gave him, yeah. Fuck...
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
You were married? All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>. Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Peter Finch.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You have to be kidding.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Yeah...
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh. Well, but if --
Shit...
Yes.
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
Really. He has a cop's face.
How do you know? Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Sure. I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.
Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
Unless you wanna tell me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here.
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair. And that suit.
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No. What do you do for a living, Gary?
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game. Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why not?
Where?
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You know.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado? Put the guns down.
I told you, I'm not going back.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
So. What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You think he's lying?
Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
Oh, nuthin'.
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
The backseat.
I don't know...
These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit.
Why? Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Really? Well, I uhhh...
Any time.
Really?
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why?
No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
It works. You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm. In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
How are you, Richard?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
You gonna write me a check?
We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal.
Siddown, Dick. They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
If that's my fate, so be it. I'm not leaving. I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
There were others.
Yeah. That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I remember you now. Shit.
We're not. I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, take the exit.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
You're not?
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Uh-huh.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
Oh, I'm here, all right. I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open.
Me?
Right now, son.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
You look great. Your dad taking good care of you?
Great. We got one of 'em.
Oh...
How you know that?
I can tell.
I <i>was</i>...
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
Flyweight.
Don't matter. I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Just a minute.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's Kenneth, my brother. He's talking on the phone.
Thanks.
You not with probation, one of those?
No.
You a lawyer?
No, I'm not. Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
He said he stayed here last November.
Here? In this house?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Something better. Open it.
It's a --
--Sig-Sauer .38. I love it.
Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically. They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
Dad...
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I'd like that.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
Huh.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
No?
No, he looks a lot...
I see that.
Off a tip?
Hello?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
It's possible. Why?
My little girl, the tough babe.
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida. Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
That's right, just me.
I don't have any idea.
Like a fag.
Likewise.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Still...
Yeah. Sure. It's all settled.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Forget about her. Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Ten gees.
Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or alive?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Are they dead?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He's been like that all day. Hey Danny, you coming?
You mean hiding them?
No, I was.
You don't forget love, Honey. Not ever.
Red...Strange?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Nervous?
Yeah. But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s- SIIING!
That's me, Sir.
Yes Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You liked that?
Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Mai-tai's. I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
You guys know her?! I gotta have an intro! Man, I'd like to --
A m-missionary?
No, like...
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
You guys get those! Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
He did.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her.
Some other time. I don't feel like a party.
Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?
Upset? Why should I be upset?
Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
Waitress! Four beers!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
Fuck you.
Come on!
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
What's there?
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank. You?
Little less.
Home of the brave.
I'm out of fuel!
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
No. You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help.
Longer? It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
We got a saying here. A-low-HA!
I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.
Well...sure.
From the air?
Hang on.
Y-Yes Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Explain what?
I know.
Sorry to trouble you.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Boxin'.
Win?
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
You too, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
We're all going away.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
We must go ahead. This is our moment.
All of 'em.
Learn English, then!
Fook ya dooble!
Crank her!
Peggy Sue!
I'm not telling.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Goodbye, Grandma.
Stag movies. Smokers.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants...
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
On what?
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
Aren't we a little old for that?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
That's disgusting!
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Don't say that...
Charlie...
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day.
I'm not going.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Would you?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Thanks.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, how are you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let's make love.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Right here. Now sit down.
Of course.
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
What the hell is that?
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
I'm trying.
Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Of course.
Test?
Touchy, touchy!
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
What, why?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
You think so?
What a treat.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Can we split now?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Thank God for that.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
All right. But this better be good.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
He'll win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Mom!
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm home now.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh. Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.
What about?
The house payments.
Sure, Mom. Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.
For what?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Way to go, Mom!
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
What does Charlie think about that?
I'm just happy to see you.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Why not? They're my favorite.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Rosalie Testa!
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
What's that?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Wbat're you talking about?
When do we start?
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
One... two... three. You are now awake.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I... um...
Pretty much so.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
How'd you know that?
Yes... why?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
You sure did...
It's been a few years.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
Sure.
It sucked.
You alright?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
All set.
Anywhere but here.
Just until he heals up?
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
There's a better place...
What did?
The old Indian burial ground.
Yeah...
He was dead. You know he was.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Maybe it takes a while...
What do you mean?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Dies?
Go later...
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
You know everything, don't you?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
In a word, Bob...
Charles is right behind me.
Bailey, Brackman.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Yes, Bob, I do. Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
Andy?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
I am relaxed.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
You're not smiling.
Drew!
I promise!
We're not skipping this treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
No.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
More than your friend. Family.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
About my blood work?
We're waiting...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
I have AIDS.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Uh, yeah.
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. What can I do for you?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Continue.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
Continue.
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Makeup.
As in, the vegetable?
Fine.
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
No. They didn't fire her.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Arline?
We're friends of Beckett's.
It's me, you dork.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Not bad.
Get it?
Let's find you a drink.
Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Sure. It's fine.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Thank you.
Correct.
You're right.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Do you... pray?
What have you prayed for?
I've considered that.
What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.
Thanks. Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Opera?
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
What kind of person is that?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Yes.
Thank you.
A good start.
Sure thing.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Do you take risks?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
No.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Yes.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
No. I can't really see it.
Thank you.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom. There's no way my client will go along with that.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Thank you.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll rephrase. Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
... we've got a committee meeting.
What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...
Second.
Great.
Aren't you?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Get a life.
Not especially.
How many do you know?
Lots.
Who?
Duh...
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
My lettuce is wilting.
Night, honey.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Why should I?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Any women on board?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
Yes, we did.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe. He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Beckett?
Dr. J.!
Andy, you don't want this.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Lookit. Lookit!
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Look deeper.
They're coming.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Entered our minds.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Actually... That's what I been askin' myself.
Saw something I didn't like.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
Think about what?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
Let's drop back an' boot up.
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
We can't make it.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
What, you're afraid?
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
It's starting....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
Like the light is scalding it.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Can we switch?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Big Evil?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably right.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Like what?
Like my pistola.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
How many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Never said you were a hype, either.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
79 kilos.
We're just burnin' light here.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
What, you're goin' off, too?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You mean that "load" of passengers?
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Company's not here, is it?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You know who Muhammad was?
Some prophet guy?
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Riddick?
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
What?
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
I would rather we all stay--
Do what I say. Please.
And what about the cells?
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
You mean....
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
And pointless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
SULEIMAN!
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Please...this solves nothing...please....
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
I'll need a receipt for that. For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Not staying in here another....
Oh, so I'm disposable?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
No. She's not.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Just realized that, huh?
What if you're one of five?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What do you care?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
So much for my cocktail hour.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
What, it's broken?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
I apologize.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Right now, if you like.
Shut up.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
No.
Neither do I.
What's so special about him?
Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Zira, come on. You know they can't -- Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
No, they won't -
It's probably wrong --
You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Zira....
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Good question. Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Let's find them all.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Him.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Hmph.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained. Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Sustained.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
I'll see.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Do as I say.
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
By our time. You've turned gray.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
Don't bother
Let's take a look.
Okay.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Fine. Just let her out.
I'm for that.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
What?
He wouldn't leave her.
All right... Get in...hurry. Put this on.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Why special?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is Taylor.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
With one of them.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course.
Then you admit --
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Shhhh!
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
Second from the left.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Maybe not.
You want her that much?
She's not sick at all. She's pregnant.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
Why not?
It's humiliating.
We can't.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
All right, but.... ...you're so damned ugly!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood --
Yes, Sir.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Where are they now?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
What?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry.
Where?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Says he can't walk.
Yeah, what is it?
Fuck you bitch.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Yeah?
What?
You lame or something?
Barnes comes from Hell.
'Lias come naturally.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
Over here!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Feelin' good's good enough.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
...don't feel like it either.
...beautiful night.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
No... I move faster alone.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What you got there - beers?
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Nah...
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Later...
...there's nobody.
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Sounds like it.
What are you talking about!
You know what I'm talking about!
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Well..
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Thank you.
Yes?
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
How long would that take?
Possibly, Miss.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
No, please.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
No thank you.
Much too late.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
I don't.
How did you meet him?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
That's all there is.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
There wasn't any plane.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
No thanks.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
That's putting it mildly.
Quarter after one. Why?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Certainly not to me.
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Dance? Here?
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
I didn't notice him.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Couldn't be.
Then he's--
Absolutely sure.
We'll find out.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Us?
All right--following me.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Nothing matters.
No use waiting, then.
So have I.
From you, I like it.
They're going to arrest me.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
I have my own warrant. Stop a minute, please.
How bad is the other thing? The secret?
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
You wouldn't like it. I've been there.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
You leave it.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
There would be a moon tonight.
Frozen.
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
That, and the fun of it.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To leave my--my note.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
So could you. But our records were a little against us.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Not this one. And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
Mine?
And that nasty man that followed us last night. You didn't kill him.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Yes. You. You're not really a murderer yet.
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer? Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
It is?
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
I've never been to Florida.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
You understand perfectly.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
There isn't anything you can do.
I don't want to talk.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
I might be able to save you. If I knew enough.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What does he see?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you. But I won't do it myself.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business. Can I drop you somewhere?
But even if you were in love with me.
Sometimes.
We know everything.
I understand, Betty. I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
All right. Get him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Who's Goble?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
Why not here?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Fascinated.
Martini.
You, Killaine?
Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
That comedian?
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Who told you my name?
I've got good ears.
A private joke.
You're not English.
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
If I can get off.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Yes, I've seen it before.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
No.
I don't.
Well--good night.
If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
Thanks. I don't mind.
I never notice the view after the first week.
Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
A couple of hours.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
Information.
Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
I'm afraid they do. Far too often. So long.
Wait a minute. I'll go with you.
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
Oh. That was just one of those idle questions. One doesn't expect an answer.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off, can't you?
Did I do something wrong?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Oh, shut up! You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Convenient, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Thank you.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
Not a floater. Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it. I've got a murder to investigate.
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Men like you don't need orders.
The joint's not open, Mac. Who's Brandon?
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Talk English. How do I know you're you?
What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.
Sounds like a fair swap. Let's take a look.
Open it and count it.
When you sign for it, you count it. It's your dough.
So it seems Sergeant.
Right.
I've met her.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
You can find out.
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Well. What about it?
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh nothing.
Are you always this witty?
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
Not quiet yet.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not. Thanks for telling me. I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does. May I go now?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield. The Mitchell case.
Mayfield? She fit into this?
She might.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Aye. You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
I don't know, sir.
Well, find out. Who's covering her?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
Two.
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
So-so.
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You ought to know why.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
That's not very kind.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
In an hour, Larry.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
I say YES!
Unsophisticated? If I knew about this babe...
It's kind of you to see me.
He was delightful.
Yes.
Good. Suez was a minefield for both parties.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
Thanks.
I think you'll do very well.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Well, we were just...
Yes.
Sit on that log, dear.
Penfield. James Penfield.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
Keep me company.
She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.
No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it.
Exactly that.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
I see.
Of course.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
No thanks. I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that. Sorry.
No. I'd want to--
Good.
Yes, please.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Thank you.
That's her.
No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night.
I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless.
Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
My real father? Well, he was a flashback.
That must be rather nice, in a way. I mean, you don't have any--
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Well, you know...
Yes, if you like. Call me at work.
I have to be up early.
Me too.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you.
Too late. Just my luck.
I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I bet. Thanks for the drink.
You just might.
Did she talk about me?
No. We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
I haven't really thought about it.
Well, you should.
I might.
Might?
Yes. Might. Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
That'll be fun
In your car
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me. There's Nicholas.
I know. I'm sorry.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes. James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
The Argies.
Come on. Hand over.
It's shit.
You approve!
Let me see.
Mmm...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Far too long.
Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here?
I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
I'll ring you.
I'm not sure.
Yes, finally.
Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot.
Are you up to something?
Fuck off.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Thanks.
Why not sit down and wait?
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all. History.
Suez. 1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
All right.
They don't count.
I'm not here.
Dad.
Come into the kitchen. I'm just making your mother's tea.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
Or a beer. I've got some in.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
Well, it's worth seeing.
What would you call it?
I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Oh no!
They won't let you in without one.
Voila!
You'd look naked without one.
Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you.
Promise?
Promise.
I won't. Goodnight.
'Night.
Tom . .. bed! Go on.
No.
Actually, I've been once today already. I'll stay here with him.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead.
De nada.
Where?
Come with Tyler. She knows.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Once.
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
Then we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.
My man!
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
I'll take that as a yes.
After you, Alfonse. I insist!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
Okay!
But you're not alone.
Good guess. There's a gun on you right now.
And let my policy expire? Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
I say when it's over!
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
Naw, you pull it!
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
There's nobody else here...
Sir?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
What?
Cole and Munoz. I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
That's the point, isn't it?
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Smart. You burn time in the vault.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Thanks for the tip. I needed this knowledge.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right? And coordination. How hard can it be?
Got it...
Patience hotshot. Patience. It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Thanks, buddy.
Right here, partner.
Awright. Get into position. I'm rolling.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
This Zen master surfer.
No way. Not yet. Come on.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two.
They took a left at the next light!
You sure?!
Nothing.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh. That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Swell's here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.
Come on. At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.
What?
You don't have to.
Warm them up.
Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Something... in the trees...
No way, old buddy.
You never did know when to quit.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
No more games.
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
Right behind you.
Anytime.
We both got scores to settle.
I saw it.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
What's that, General?
Someone else will be going in with you.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Hawkins?
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Philip! We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
I do. I take it all very personally. Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Thunder's a horse. Come on.
Hope to be?
I see. Well. Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Storage, I think.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
I talked to some developers about the land.
What?
Who indeed...
No. What I have is a lot of money.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
How?
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.
Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure. For five bucks.
That's ridiculous.
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Sit-and-spin. Alright... why not?
No.
Stolen?
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once. Give me a break.
What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah. I've tried them. Turn right.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean to.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You couldn't afford it.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward. My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
What?
You know how to drive a stick?
Then let's go. It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Why?
Exactly.
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money. Speaking of which, cash'll do. In advance.
Right. So! In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be. They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yes...
You didn't wake me. I'll be out of here in a minute.
No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
Occupational hazard?
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.
No? Why's that?
"Occupational hazard".
No shit. They expensive?
... dollars?
I sell them.
What? Why?
What are assets?
Vivian --
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Not... quite.
There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Where'd you learn to do this?
What?
I'm in town until Saturday.
Of course. How much?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Holy shit.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one? Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Oooh!
You're forgiven.
Some game. Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
You liked the guy, though.
Uh-uh. No work.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Why not?
Good.
Come with me?
Thank you. I would. Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Please.
Dinner can wait.
No.
Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
You did.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex?
Shall we mingle?
I thought I was the pro. These women make me feel like an amateur.
Vivian, what the --
Vivian...
Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
I'll call you a cab. If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Shush. Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
I'll guard them and you with my life.
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
The opera.
I'm glad you like it. Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it.
I know. I'm glad.
Did you?
Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
You just did.
What do you mean?
It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
Business.
Yes. The man made a business decision.
It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It was good.
It felt good.
Vivian...
It's not your fault. You're right. Kit's right. But I want the fairy tale.
Of course, yes. If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
My what?
The young lady staying in your room?
Afternoon.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
No.
Yes! And you don't even know where you're going!
I'll bring it back.
I'm here.
I know a lot of nice girls.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Do it.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife, Elizabeth.
We just did.
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell?
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
Let him answer.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Have you lost your mind?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I think I broke my hand. You're fired.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Yes.
Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet. That was our rent!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I will. I'm trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Forget it. We work for it. We keep it.
He's not gonna want us.
Kit! Where've you been?
I was asleep. You woke me. You okay?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Baby! Rodeo Drive.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah. I just got it.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I pray for that.
I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy.
Wow, are you in deep shit. You know he'll break your heart.
School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Do I!? Momma!
And leave all this? Not in a million.
Yeah. Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second. Here's some money.
No. You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent. You're late.
Don't give me that. Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Kit give me nothin'.
You bullshittin' me?
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Okay.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I leave extras, miss.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
I... Edward...
Vivian.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Okay. Thanks, Barney. You're the best.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Steak spoon!
Miss Vivian.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes. Something... conservative.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
It's very expensive.
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
'Scume me.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I was in here yesterday.
Yeah. Thanks.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
It's okay. Edward told me. Your secret's safe with me.
I just might do that.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Of course.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
There will never be a need.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57.
You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64.
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117.
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
And a good thing too.
Who's Guilder?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go!
Anybody want a peanut?
Veer left. Left. Left!
I thought I was going faster.
I'm waiting!
What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
It's you.
True!
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Yeah?
I don't think more than ten.
-- what? --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
But you don't know where he is.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Right, right, sorry.
What?
I hope we win...
I'll be right back.
What is it?
Open it up.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-- well, when does it get good?
I don't be-leeve this.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17.
What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
I don't mind so much.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124.
As you wish...
Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Try ruling the world sometime.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
DEATH FIRST!!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Not yet.
Light him.
I thought he was with you.
No.
In that case --
Stop saying that!
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Okay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97.
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
Again. Thank you.
You are ready, then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Begin!
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Then why are you smiling?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Tell me.
I am not left-handed either.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
That would be inconceivable.
You're sure nobody's following us?
I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15.
Inconceivable!
You know what a hurry we're in.
There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her!
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Morons.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
For the Princess?
Good. Then pour the wine.
I smell nothing.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Australia.
I will. And I choose --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
I'm not listening.
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Yeah, an hour.
A good hour. Yeah.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Bye.
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.
What are you saying?
Let's hear him. What have we got to lose? What's your name?
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,

"Keep a shining in...
How do you do. I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you? Say ooops and get out.
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Shut up. I'm having a rhetorical conversation. How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Good, what is it?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry. Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
What you were saying. Keep talking.
What was I saying?
Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Exactly. And how long did it run?
One night.
What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Go away from me. You frighten me. Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
How's this?
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
I already have. Come on.
Oh.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island?
Then stick with Bialystock!
I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.
Maybe you're happy.
Yes. That's it. Happy. Well, whatta ya think of that. Happy.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What is she gonna do here?
I'll show you. Ulla, go to work.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
To failure!
No way out. No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
No way out. No way out. What? Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Double. Double. Double.
What???
Shut up.
Liebkind, no!
What is it?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Yes.
Vat about it?
With whom?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Yes. We would!
Good. I will make the preparations.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
I'm not crazy. I'm inept.
Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Come on. Let's get going.
Qviet. Qviet This is very important.
Of course I need you. It's dark in there.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur. Get car.
Good. Good. We go Motel.
No. We go.
No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.
Get car. Get car.
Very nice girl.
No! No! We don't make love. Go to work.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Here I come, ready or not.
We can't play today?
Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
All right. All right.
Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch me.
Thursday. I'll see you Thursday.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I shall count the minutes.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta. Ta.
Ta. Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back. I don't want to miss one minute of it.

People can hear you.
Stop! Stop! This is insanity.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you. All for one and all in the light.
What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
No good, baby, no good. You heard my orders. Nobody retreats. Attack! Attack!
Who can we attack? They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
We can't... we keep our money there!
Send for Goebbels.
Heil, baby! I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
We won.
Groovy!
No.
I'm not the police.
Oh.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Look at the picture. Please.
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
How do you know she didn't make a call?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
My mother.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
No. I told you, she's confined...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Who are you, friend?
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator. Where is she, Miss Crane?
Money.
Must've needed it.
What are you talking about? What is this?
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Sam, if she's here...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
What?
How much?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
All right.
Okay. If you'll come along...
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Sure...
Lila.
Is Mary here?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Here?
With you.
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
Don't you know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No. I take it you don't either? How long?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Huh?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind... You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
No.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Where's the old highway?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Arbogast said...
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? Thanks.
Sam, I'm going.
You'll never find it.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Contemplate your... panic button.
Sam.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Without calling me?
In a hurry.
Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Well?
Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start... Except at the beginning.
Yes.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
You're not.
Neither will I.
Of course we will.
Alive.
Huh?
She always tries to be proper.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I'm glad we didn't.
Hospital clean.
What?
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
Bates.
I could stand something regular.
We could laze around here a while longer.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam!
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
Can you?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
All right.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
Los Angeles.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Norman Bates.
I have?
Mother... ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You'd know, of course.
Uncommon, too.
I imagine so.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
I'd like to, but...
Alright, Miss...
Crane.
That's it.
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there?
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Why?
Please.
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
I'll show you the cabin.
Fine.
Yes.
I didn't think so.
I don't know what you've been saying.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Leave me alone!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
What--special autopsy?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Indeed, he has often told me.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
Who are you? What is your name?
I don't know, [I tell you].
Maybe you want my money, too.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Well, news of Buckley?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something. Those women have--the gleam--
He isn't here.
I'm going to call the police.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
Yes!
The master ... is asleep!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
No?
No! Good night!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Did you? Where?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I'll have it for supper. So long.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Delighted, I'm sure.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Ralph! Ralph!
The body of Joan Gale!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item? From a little bird?
Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
What!
Let it go.
What do you mean?
Almost certain.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
No kiddin'.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What does that prove?
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
It's all yours.
Thanks.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
That's what they're going to ask you.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
You go in for dangerous things.
Darned if I don't!
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Good night, sir.
Good night. And I am very grateful to you.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Yes.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Thanks.
You did.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in. Results taken. What if I didn't miss?
Excuse me???
What was her name? The one I met.
Yes....
Day or night?
I'm heading out of town.
Okay.
I could go out of town.
Where to?
A place you've never been.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways.
What universe are you in, Paul?
A quantum one.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
How?
God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Wait. I want to tell you something.
Then you get it. You'll understand.
What?
So I can move on. You too.
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Well, I got to see her.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Nobody.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
But I'm curious, Rose.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
'Course it does.
Don't mention it.
Well, some fiend might.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
Good night, Rose.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Yeah.
You're my sweetheart.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I do, too.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't. I think I hear a car.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
No.
I think Daddy suspects.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Okay.
At least.
They're discussing it.
I can't see, let me see...
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
Let me look. Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Of course.
I think we both know her.
Yes, we know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
What do you think of her, honey?
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You're not having lunch?
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
Honey, please...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
He's a polecat, dear.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Fine.
Who?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
It'll do just fine. Bye-bye, see you later.
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I'm not hungry.
Oh, no, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, air.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid? Ah, ha!
Well, it's Billy.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
You mean a farm?
What?
Mine.
Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Nothing, Rose.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
She has other things to do, Dave.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I see. Outside it.
Yeah, I remember it.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Afraid of the hospital?
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I had better call Daddy.
Be quiet, Rose.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
Yes, ma'am.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Incestuous.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
What and? That's what I got.
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Just entering. We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Abe Lincoln...
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really? Is that a fact... ?
Again.
I don't know, okay? All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Whoa, thanks, man. These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Save it. Just go.
What do you want me to do about it?
No you can't.
Get ready.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Move it!
Relax.
We should slow down.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
I'm just saying...
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Stop blaming yourself.
I got him.
Who's that? Zimmermann's money-man?
It's personal. We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour. See ya then.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes. It's a tax dodge.
Could be worse. I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Wh... what... ?!
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
Beats me. You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
What?
The booze.
Dean Martin.
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Same day as before. I think.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Feeling great.
You don't smoke.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Yeah. Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
It's not gonna happen.
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Bullshit.
No, but it should.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
It's go time, Billy-B.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Follow me.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
We have to find Kittle.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
We're not stealing. We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up. We're police. How can we steal from ourselves?
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Can't you say something nice once?
Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
You're lying...
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Go wherever you want. Live how you want.
There probably is.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this. Are you even listening?
I'm here. That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
You can't be serious.
Can't I?
Don't bother. This behavior's gone on too long. You're suspended.
What?
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me. Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
You know... you could say thank you.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know what I mean.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
"Go, go, go!" "Slow down." Make up your mind.
Don't crowd him.
Shit. You're right.
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
Okay, okay... hold on. Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
I know it is, even if you don't.
Nothing's broke. Keep sewing. And quit pacing, you big ox. You're making me skittish.
Whatever goes bang.
All for one...
Out here. On your knees.
Dead.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Just got here.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Come again... ?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.
Maybe it's enough.
Your wish is my command.
Who is that... ?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
I'm well aware of that.
Beholden to none.
Who the fuck knows? We'll find out soon enough.
Billy! Billy!
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Keep 'em busy.
Yeah.
Good. Thought I was imagining them.
It's one of a kind.
So are you, Pop-Sweet. That's why...
They're... around.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
All right. Stand by.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Yoda will always be with you.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Oh... great!
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
All set.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Leia!
I gotta get you out of here.
That's all any of us can see.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
I don't know.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Charges! Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
Lando!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
You, too.
All right, hang on.
Proper?!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Let's see.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Your Royal Highness.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Oh, no.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
But, why must you confront him?
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
If that is your destiny.
I will not fight you, father.
There is no conflict.
I will not fight you.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Your father he is.
Yes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Certainly not!
Oh well. How about you.
I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice?
Nothing. Why do you think I should?
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm. He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Janet.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Janet
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I've got something to say.
Uh huh.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh...
But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Just a moment, Janet. They may have a telephone.
Yes.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light.
No, don't do that.
Oh don't be so shy.
Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I hope so my darling.
You know this earth - this person.
I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Yes.
Yes, Dr Scott. A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
I didn't make him for you
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry

The delivery boy.
Creature of the night.
They didn't like me. They never liked me.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
...I don't know.
Shell-shocked!
To you, to me it's Thursday.
I think it's closed.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Absolutely.
Ohh!
By accident?
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It doesn't bother me either.
...Guess.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
...No thanks.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
I'll call your brother.
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
What?
The glasses... Please.
Do me another favor?
...What?
Could ya take off that hat.
Don't tease me.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
I'll be waiting.
Yes.
It did.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
...Yes --
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Is everything all right?
I gotta go out for a while.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Don't say that.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paulie, please --
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
I can't go out.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Paul.
Christ.
You didn't!
That so.
Paulie!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Get outta my life both of ya's.
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
What?!
Give my main man a raise!!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
No, man, it's very smart.
Fouls.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
...Still don't feel no heat.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
...This man.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Very high an' very fast.
Of wa?
...Of the truck that run over your face.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Does that bum have to say that?
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Charge it.
What's happenin' here?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Not yellow, cautious. See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
You have my food in ya hand.
Ya sure?
You think I don't hear things?
Paulie's sister.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
A few bucks.
Do I have to pay juice?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go. Bet three grand on Rocky.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No -- Just me.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
I'm sure you are.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did you hear what I said?
What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.
Hey --
What?
Stuff it, man!
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Maybe I like garbage.
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
'Night, Marie.

I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
...Tomato?
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --

How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ain't they?
...No.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I said that before.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...What?
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Please, kid.
I never had good footwork.
Check the eyes, Ben.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
...Shrewd.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Real good.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Damn! How's it look?
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.
Great, kid, great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Bullmastiff.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Hey --
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Let's get outta this stink.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Absolutely...
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
What kinda business?
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Ice skate.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I'll do okay.
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
...No.
Gazzo's a good man.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me? Please do me that favor.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
The story -- what's happenin'?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
To see ya train.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
...People talk to me more.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Maybe --
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Well, I'll be...
So what's your next move, Valiant?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.
Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the safe.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about? Here's your fifty bucks.
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think. I wanna drink.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
It's all yours.
I oughta have my head examined. Will you hold still?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, no...
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
They?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
Surprised?
That's right, me.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
What am I, Earl?
No...
Does it hurt?
Not much. It's hard to talk.
Okay, you've seen me. Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
That's not Roger. It's one of Doom's men. He killed R.K. Maroon.
Don't worry, you're not the first. We better get out of here.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
He's right here in the...
Eddie, come on.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Wait here...
Doom.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Frankly, I'm shocked. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested.
Have you got the will?
Maybe. Why?
That was the idea.
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Divorce? Never!
Aah!
I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.
You idiot. I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Yeah, that's better.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
How do you know that?
An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink. How about it, Judge?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk. All of it.
My brother. Get inside.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Me.
Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Forget it.
Two bits.
I rest my case.
Yeah?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Good idea.
I guess I am at that. Cigar?
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Have patience!
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Then I'll leave thee.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out--
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Goodnight.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
You kiss by the book.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
By the hour of nine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
A Plague o' both your houses.
NO! Mercutio!
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
I am for you.
Is she a Capulet?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Do you really think so?
You know it is.
What?
Is that right?
Leaving...
And I don't believe you...
Who the fuck are you?
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
And who are you?
The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
How do we know that?
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me, thanks.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
Nothing.
They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.
That's him.
You lose them!
Not yet...
They're good!
No, Seamus. I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
Once.
I still am.
Is that right?
That's right.
Duty calls?
Just business.
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Bloody fucking hell...
Alright? It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Shut up!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Really? Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
I think not. After you...
Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
Of course.
In here...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Enough!
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What's that?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I do, I do...
Hello, my friend. He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course. Don't you?
Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.
Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
I didn't expect that he would.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps. But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Why don't you go do better, then...
My way is better.
What a surprise...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Who's they?
Everybody.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Not in mine.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Who else would you be?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
No thanks.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
Things. This is my country, you know.
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
I don't. But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
Exactly. Why not bring them?
Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
Who am I?
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
Gregor's cell phone...
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
You don't. You just learn to live with it.
But you can't.
You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
I know of him.
Yes.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I know. Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
Because I owe you. Look at that...
You think?
I don't know...
You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.
I think not.
Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.
Just like that?
Would you stop with that...
Why not?
Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.
I'll work on it...
Finish the job...
And now...
Finish it!
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
Nothing...
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
Gone. Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Why didn't you kill him?
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright. And you?
Doing well. This is?
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I might know where you could get a copy.
The Russian would be easier.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I want to get some hounds down here.
I can't get enough of it.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Never heard of it.
Oh, you would have done great.
I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Shit, more than that.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Why? Are you kidding me?
Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We'll figure something out.
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?
Because...I know.
At the expense of six people.
Maybe. Who cares?
Torch it?!
What's that?
What are you gonna do?
He saw everything!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Okay then. I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
I don't know...
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
No we didn't. He died on his own.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I don't know...
Okay then. I'll do it.
Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let's get this over with!
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
Neither do I.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight...
I don't know! Shit, give me a break!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
There it is...now what about the others?
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so. Let's go.
I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
That's right.
Then Sally comes too.
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He killed her...
What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work.
It's NOT too late!
Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
I'm all ears.
We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down.
That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
By Friday.
What are you proposing?
I want my share. All of it.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
HELLLLLP!!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
Hello.
Because someone may have gotten away.
Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report.
What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.
What for?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
Has he?
No. But he would, probably.
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Heard you had quite a night.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I know.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.
I love you too.
I'm in here.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Nothing happened?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, it is...
Yeah. I want to tell you everything.
I don't believe it.
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Could it have been this?
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
Yeah.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
What?
I have a better plan.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What?
Am I speaking English here? How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid... ...that hurts, son.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
This just might be our ticket!
Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
What are you getting at?
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Maybe I should come along.
Dwayne.
Did you say After Midnight?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
Well I don't know...
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh.
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C? 32 C?
No I don't. You sure you havent seen her?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
Yeah. That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah...see you at three.
Well I'm here now.
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
What?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Forget it.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Watch that. Watch that tone.
That hasn't stopped you before.
I didn't say that. You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
It certainly is...
Dwayne put the gun down --
Shut up!!! Slut!!!
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Calm down --
Right behind you.
What?
Just do it! Meet me there, now.
Well you're not getting, either.
Listen -
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you can't have it.
You're never getting that much.
I think I am.
We're gonna talk.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Yeah.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Yeah. Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Absolutely positively.
Give me the bad news.
Money.
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
So...what's the good news?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
We're going to find out.
What do you think? Heart attack?
I'm not getting an answer.
Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Two-hundred thousand dollars? Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm with the band. I'm the lead singer.
The band has been playing over an hour.
What?? Where'd you hear that?
I got my sources.
Is this about the funny money?
How'd you know?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken.
San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon? You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge.
We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
So what's your story?
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
I said get on your feet!
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit?
I don't think so...
It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
Lee, you okay?
That's right.
You bring American money?
Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.
No. It's my first time.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
I said that? Which word was "goat?"
Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half.
Bathroom.
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Try to land on your feet.
I'm sorry.
I am a tourist.
How you doin'?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
Hey! You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Don't look at my ass!
Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home.
And you ain't black!
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu? Never met him.
Not Yu. You!
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
I'm okay, you go.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama. Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No. She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Good at what?
Forget it.
IT IS CRAZY!
I know. I know. I am sorry.
What?
You said --
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Excuse me?
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
What did you say?
Nothing. I said nothing.
Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
No. It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
What?
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired...
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
It's a bomb.
We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Shhh, my head hurts.
It doesn't matter.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world.
I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
Yes. We have heaven.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
Fine by me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken. Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.
Are you serious?
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
End of the line.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Wait here. I'll handle this.
Dancing?
Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
I'll give it my best shot.
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
No you didn't!
Yes I did. I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
Carter...
Just GO!
No problem.
Yes.
I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay. I can finally let it go.
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.
No, Carter. I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
This money is evidence.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Excuse me?
I need your help.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there. That's the eye in the sky room.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Dip me!
No. But I'll help you.
I'm fine.
Now you know.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Baby Duck?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
The Secret Service? Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
I'll take him.
Don't.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
Yes, Master.
Ricky Tan?
I know, Master, but...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation.
In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Carter.
This is pathetic.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch! Your ass is goin' to jail!
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
You're shittin' me. You know the Beach Boys?!
Beach Boy America. Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
No.
A little.
Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
We are both full of shit.
What?
That silly-ass look on your face.
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
Right....
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What plate?
The license! You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit! You were trying' to lose my ass again.
No. I just made it up.
I could not come. I had other responsibilities.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
It happens.
Yeah, it's good.
That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
No, no. It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll. Ya'll!
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete? This is still America.
What do you hear?
I am from outa town.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up. Take the damn gun.
Oh yes.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.
What?
The art.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
OK. Well...make us proud. And be careful.
Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing?
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
It's okay. For restaurants.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Don't play bullshit games with me.
What?!
You a cop or something?
Or somethin'.
I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
Nobody touches me.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin? Where are you.
You have what I asked for?
I do.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I still have work to do here.
After I left?
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
Let me take you back inside, okay?
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it! Hold it! I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Maintain eye contact.
What did he ask?
It happens to be how I feel.
Weird. Like after all those years you would remem--
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
I left four messages. You don't return my calls.
What?
Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?
I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.
I'm sorry, too. Wow. That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
All the gory details.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Why do YOU think she ran?
And you defending her?
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.
Oh, I will.
Tootaloo.
No, I'm not.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Betty Trout. Five dollars.
Bye, Betty. Thanks.
Oh, come on. You're practically family.
Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You know, your daughter seems...
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
Yes.
We'll see.
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
He is not!
You can turn that finger around.
How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.
Still sweet.
What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!
So? Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
Of course.
What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?
You know, there's no...
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
No. You take it.
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
You humiliated me!
Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.
That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I love you, too.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
So am I.
So, we'll...
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yup!
She's the boss.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Where?
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.
Thanks. Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.
Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?
It's for the bell.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.
Not eight...
No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
Quick. Very quick.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No. It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, you tell her.
No, no. You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?
Nope.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
Boats. You go out in them. You come back in them. I hate them.
But it's on the water.
-- who's married to --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I love you.
I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Even when you were young?
Nope. Not even when I was young.
Don't be silly. I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Go to the Symphony --
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Okay, okay.
About forever.
No.
You couldn't.
I do.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
So what happened?
I told you. Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What?
Look!
About what?
Whatever it is.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What was what?
What's with you?
Nothing's with me.
That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
Not.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
"I want to meet you..."
Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
That's impossible. A guy can't --
Can too.
No.
Yes.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Listen to this, I love this part --
I know.
Turn on your radio!
What?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Definitely.
I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you. I love you.
I love you, too.
Good night.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
I saw her. She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
Made for each other.
What about the letter?
No, I'm not.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
Okay.
No, I know that part --
No. Not remotely. I just want to find out about him.
You want a tail. I got a guy in Seattle --
I know.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Yes.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
Howard.
Howard.
What?
Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Any time.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Are his folks nice?
You know.
What?
Magic. It was magic.
Magic.
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do --
Magic.
Hello.
It's me?
The one in the street. I chased after you.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace the dispatcher. Great.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
Good. How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
No.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
She died.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
Why not?
Yeah.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
Right, right.
Seventy... eight.
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
H and G. Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah. What's that?
Your only hope.
I don't get it.
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
Eighty dollars.
I have forty-two. So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
But how am I going to get there?
Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't know. Do I?
What is it?
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
We desperately need a spice rack. Desperately.
It's never happening again. Right?
Right.
My feelings exactly.
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
You're right. You better hope so.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
P. Dad?
What?
I forgot to mention. Jed called --
So I can go.
Sure. Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Stressed.
Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Thank God. Something you don't know. It's a single white female.
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm starting to notice that.
Will she scratch up your back?
What?
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
How do you know?
What was?
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Good.
Sleepless and Son. Baltimore.
Now I'm late. Bye.
Not now, Jonah --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I'm glad you liked it. Good night, Jonah.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
That's true. Why is that?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
It might be in the kitchen.
Yes.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
When I found you?
If I didn't go.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
No.
It was all they had.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.
What about it?
Do you like it?
Well...
I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi. Sam?
Yes?
You must be Jonah.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.
I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
What do you mean?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Hi.
You look good yourself.
You did?
Oh.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
It takes time --
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You're welcome to one.
No thanks.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
That's none of their affair.
How's it going?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
It never ends.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
So much the better.
An American.
No, Estellita.
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
Got to talk to the brothers.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
What has it got me, your union?
Never... never... never!
Aaah, what's the use?
I'm a fool.
No, no ...
Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
I did forget. Lus told me.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there. And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Can be what?
Backward.
Sure.
Yes.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm going back tomorrow.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
A meeting?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
You weren't waiting for me.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
What are you saying?
But honey ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Are you Australian?
No.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
I was talking to my wife.
Shhh.
The spiders.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Come on. Ease off the girl.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. Rhymes with ...
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Did you see his hair color?
No, Why?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Now that's down-right insulting.
I'll have to live with that. My money my risk, my rules.
Everything go?
Yeah.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Leave me out of this.
That bad, huh?
Ouch.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Colette ...
Nothing.
Go ahead.
Then leave.
I can't.
Why not?
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
Because he'll kill me.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
That's long enough to get out of town.
How?
What happened to your eye?
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
It's the only way to play.
I try.
Nothing.
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
You always been this stubborn?
I been that way ever since.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I can't tell you.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Danny, it's not what you think.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you. Go.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
What?
It's Tom.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
How?
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
Midnight?
I know a guy.
Lead the way.
I hadn't noticed. I've seen you around. What's your name?
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Oh ... that. Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
You on a roll?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I know a buyer. Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Can your man handle that?
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Sure.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Not tonight.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Yeah, that's what I mean. Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
No You think she's a tweaker?
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Hey, check it out...
I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
The good stuff. Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill.
What?!
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uh-uh-uh ...
Okay! Okay!
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Yeah.
Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Yeah, dickhead.
You go, boy.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
No last name?
It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Tell me what?
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Bubba.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean? He told me -
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
Answer the fucking question!
It speaks!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
What's he holding?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
And what does this have to do with me?
What?!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
Worse. Much worse. A teacher.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
I was talking about Miles.
And you've got wiener breath.
Really?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
There's no motels around here.
No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Okay, okay. There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Just admit you're wrong.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Now that's scary!
Good work, Flynne. You're a first-rate rat.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Better than drugs.
Don't worry about it.
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
No, you can't taste it. It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
Where are your men now?
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Figured.
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Shut up, will you?
The hell he didn't.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Hell, no!
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
What deal?
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
I'd love to hear it.
In the shadow by those two trees.
My guess, too.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Who's Wade?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Keep trying.
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
Senator's son?
It was nothing.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Like I said, it was nothing. Don't bunch up.
Pass.
Sarge?
You think the rest of us were?
Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Some.
Where are you from, Captain?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Those guns are close.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Goddamn it, sir...
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I changed my mind.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
Simpson.
Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade. Translators?
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
I've got a line on one.
Yep, hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
That's not what we're here for.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders. Let's go.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me. Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
Good news?
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
And what about you?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
You never know.
Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Yup, hell of a mission.
It doesn't take this.
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
How about you shut up and take your position?
About to pour his sulfa. Sees the wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal.
Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Let's just find someplace.
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
Just what I want to do.
You're welcome, John.
Yes, sir.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
But, sir...
Sure, Reiben.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Huh?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
We can't leave it here.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
ON THE BRIDGE! WE'RE COMING IN.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Have it your way, Captain.
HERE THEY COME!
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
That's not where I am. Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
FIRES a burst. More Germans drop.
Knows what that means. He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Alright, come with me.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Yes, sir.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Races through the debris. Trailed by BULLETS.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Yeah?
Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Frogs?
Lingerie.
Yeah? So?
What are we likely to run into?
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you got a mother?
Get lost.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows? It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
No, no he's not.
Understanding the following rights...
Speak with my lawyer.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
And your former wife.
That's right.
Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Excellent.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Okay, thanks.
You're sure?
Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.
Hey, sis.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Yeah.
I still am.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'll be home soon.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
But you never had a first date.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Okay, I got it.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
See you. Bye. Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
I already did.
Read it.
I am.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Come on, it's graduation.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What? I'm sorry, talk.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
What is wrong with this girl?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can accept that.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
Alright.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
You like it?
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!
We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Goodnight.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Crash paranoia.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You're going.
You're not listening to me.
I like him a lot.
Dad, I love him.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Just finishing up in here.
Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
Yes, I...
I made their lives better.
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
You're right.
Hi.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
You will?
Look at those eyes.
Hi. You called me?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah. What a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
No, I read it on the message.
Busy?
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Hmmm....
No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah
They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.
Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
No.
No.
Yeah.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Bye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
They knew of you. Now they know you.
Yeah. I'm so glad we did this.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Twisted?
You know what?
What?
So what's your job this summer?
Job? Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Mmmm.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
I'll see you there. Bye.
Okay.
She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Wait, wait. You told her about me?
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti- social.
Be friends?
Yeah. With potential.
Friends with potential.
Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Right.
Am I wrecking my car?
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Yeah.
Yes. Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know. I'm happy.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh. It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it.
What? This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
Yeah.
Okay. It's good knowing this.
Yeah, uh-huh.
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.
Then don't do it.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
What?
I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
I love you. Please, I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Not right now, thanks.
Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
I know.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength. Poor little man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
The truck?
Oh. Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
What?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is. Good luck.
Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye.
Jim Court... no, this is her father. I'll take...
Hello Lloyd.
How ya doing? Is she around?
Yeah. Honey?
How do you pay for one of those?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
No, really.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Are you?
She's very successful.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Your car?
Dude, I can't do it!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
What?
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
Alright. Key?
How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.
You know Diane Court?
Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was gonna...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I was just going to kind of move around.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Alright!
I love you too.
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
He is.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
Oskar, please -
What -
A charade? How could it be a charade?
War.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
It's a beautiful city.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
In Breslau.
Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.
Good.
They're mine!
Yeah, what's that?
I pay you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I want him. Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know. Soon.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You're not telling me something.
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
Yeah, I can.
Of course I'm on it.
You want to stay on it? What do you got for me?
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays.
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
She's good.
How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do.
Things are great, things are great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here. I guess I haven't been out.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Wine?
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.
What others?
Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Done. Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Something they can hold in their hands.
They should be.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
The war could end.
Do what?
Ah, yes.
Thank you.
Oskar -
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
What other point is -
It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.
I think it's too late.
Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.
More.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
Stern.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You don't? I do. I see a difference.
You'll lose money.
No, no, what, what is it?
I didn't do enough.
You did so much.
Would it do any good?
No.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
On national television.
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Where?
Stop it...
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
That's okay.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Where is everybody?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why aren't you there?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm inquisitive.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
No, it's me.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Its over, Cotton.
Not until youre dead.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Good for you.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.
Let us decide that.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
No. This is a set up.
Thats quick.
Good question. You took the bait.
Youre not going to get away with this.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
What guy?
Randy somebody.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I got it..
He hates Oliver Stone.
I find his work overwrought.
Until now.
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Just for you, Sid.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Tuitions expensive.
Miss Weathers.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Yeah?
Not good.
Billy had alibis too.
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
..and as lonely as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
And Joel's pre-med.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Let's find out.
Over here.
C'mon. Let's go.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Don't worry...
Dewey, there's no such place.
Humor me, Sid.
Whatever.
I'll give you one guess.
That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.
What if your life depended on it?
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, wait...
Watch your back.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I'm sorry.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Oh my God.
Are you in danger now?
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
I dont know.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
The safety what? Fuck that!
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Too bad.
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Hello? Hello?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I'd really just like to be alone.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
I counted four.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Her old boyfriend?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
Easy black boy.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
But...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
What's your favorite scary movie?
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
We got free tickets.
But...
Now.
Shush.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
You are so not funny.
I get scared really easy, okay.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
He's after me.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
I don't know.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Do I?
Asshole, Can't talk.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Thanks.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
More of a game really.
What kind of a game?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
Reaction to what?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
There's more.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Absolutely.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you? Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
What did you know about your mother?
How is that good news?
Catch him, or kill him.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
What Rielly?
There's someone here who wants to help.
The killer called her.
What? When?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey. We tried, we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
Off the record.
Always.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I'm on duty.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Fuck!
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer. And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Sure.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Possibly.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Good twist.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Who?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Huh, fine.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
Hello.
Who's this?
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
It is in my script.
What? What movie?
My movie.
No.
W-what do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Who is this?
The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.
Go there.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
No one's saying you did.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Sorry.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Oh...
You know it.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
Now that it's out of your system.
I'm going... I'm going.
What's that?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Or even a good porno.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Fuck you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Are you alone in the house?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
I want to talk to you for a second.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I don't think so.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
What's your favorite scary movie?
You have to have a favorite.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
You never told me your name.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
What do you think I said?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
Don't...
I told you not to hang up on me.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
No...
Then he dies. Right now.
NOOO!
Which is it?
Turn off the light.
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
Come on, yes you do.
Please..stop...
I can't think.
YES!
NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Answer the question and I will.
What?
Your call.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll get my camera.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Shit.
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
How is everything?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
I told you to send it back.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
Call the police.
The phone's dead.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
Yes, that's right.
It'll be out later this year.
I'll send you a copy.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Why would she lie about it?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
And why would she do that?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Ricki Lake.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Your front porch.
That's the original part.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
What am I doing?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello Sidney.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Who are you?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
Got it.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
You got it.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
What?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
No, Sid.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
What happened?
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's school-related?
How do you gut someone?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Later.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, Tatum.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
I don't know...
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
Come on, let's rock.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
I don't know, they just did.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Tits -- see.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
How's that?
Thank you.
He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.
Ease back, Mills.
I'm in.
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what? This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
Greed. It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
Good.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
You know.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
Really?
He's not finished.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
I read about it in the paper.
What? What?
Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
Turn around. Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? What are you doing out here?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
Okay...
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
Why?
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
Her pretty head.
NO!
You'll see.
Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though. What I'm doing.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
It's close.
Shut up!
What the fuck is going on?
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Because I envy your normal life. Envy is my sin.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
For now.
No one yet.
What?
There's a bucket. Under the table.
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Guessing at this point is useless.
No.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.
How's that?
Tonight.
Hello.
What about them?
I read. Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
Punishing.
Did you read them?
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.
I know.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It's got to be.
A switchblade.
We're screwed. He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me. I'm new in town.
Yes. They were there... so, it must be.
We'll tag along.
Satisfy our curiosity?
And?
Call an ambulance.
No kidding! No fucking kidding!
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
Oh, it's alright.
Who pays the rent on time.
This is the job. It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Yes we do. Here...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
I don't know... like fifty.
Let's go.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
How do you know all about this?
I don't. Neither do you.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Divine Comedy. A History of Catholicism. A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It's not what you think it is.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Saint Thomas Aquinas. He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him. Talk to him.
You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?
I'm fine.
What happened?
It was him.
You can't go in there.
We need a warrant.
We have probable cause now.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
I'm trying, alright? Just tell me what we've got.
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
How can you say that? Especially after today?
Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
Big surprise.
When do we get to question him?
I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
Well, I have to tell you... I think I've fallen in love with you.
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
What are you talking about? What happened?
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I... I don't understand.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
What?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit down.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
It surprises me. It really does.
Too long. What do you think so far?
If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
It's a hard place.
I don't sleep very well.
I'm sorry, I only...
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I don't know...
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.
I don't know.
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
What, Ben?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Why don't you finish the job?
Huh...? No...no water.
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
I ain't wearing no gun.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
No sir...pleasure.
In that case, give the boys room...
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
By what you preach...none!
Just keep goin'...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
You got one now!
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
How many, would you say?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Now mount up, son...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
I'm Clayton.
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
Grab hold!...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
These are my people... Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You were born old...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Told ya, didn't I?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy... Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
You got it with you?
Ain't yours yet.
I beg your pardon?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
You've done a lot of growin'...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yes, sir.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
Easy! It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Leggo...
If they're still alive...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Huh...? Sure I'm all right...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Why?
Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
What's that?
You all settled an' comfortable now?
He just couldn't wait...
Whatchu doin'?...
Scar?
Forget it...
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Nine... Ten!
What's the sense in it!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Not likely.
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Over there!
We won't be here...Come on!
What's goin' on?
It's what I'm countin' on.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
No...not yet...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
From the beginning...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
We got two around that age...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Sorry... Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Come on, say it. You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs. A real antiquity! I think it's great.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Are you crazy? That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
Hey, take your time. You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Someone from the village.
Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks. I have everything I need. Drive safely, you hear?
Oh, baloney. You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village. Look what I found.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
I haven't the slightest idea.
Look at this! The dog! She's dead!
An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Hi, darling.
We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
'HE'? Whom do you mean-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller? Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You don't remember?
Thank you.
Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Does this dog here belong to you?
It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip. You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
What?
Just call me Elisabeth.
Excuse us. But do stop by for a visit sometime! You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Yes, something was...
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Tenth floor.
Very funny.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Mercutio
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Thank you, Ned.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Really?
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Lady?
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait! Will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery
Never!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Ask him.
No Juliet?!
See you in jail.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Ned is wrong for it.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
No, no. You have a wife, children
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Who is that?
Yes, I saw it.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And his ears.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Good title.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Oh, that.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
Nobody knew!
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Every word.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised! Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
Fifty pounds? What for?
No, then.
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Tomorrow
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
What? Who?
Romeo.
The one who came with your letter?
What?
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
How will it?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Good title.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo is Italian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Of love?"
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
I will.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Stand up straight, girl.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
And I love poetry above all.
Above Lord Wessex?
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Madam!"
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice Have they dropped?
Luck be with you, Sam. Sam ?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow "
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
"She speaks.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
Is she obedient?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I'll be damned if you are!
I have to get back.
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
It is strange to me, too.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl--come to bed
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it is mine too!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
A literary feud. Quite normal.
Oh, my love You ran from me before.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
and thus unable to declare her love
How does it?
I don't know. It's a mystery
Nor you for me.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
Write me well.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
You flatter, my lord.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
The Queen has consented?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
I . . .
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Does she say so?
Your aunt?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
That dog!
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Why, thank you, David.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
No.
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
Take his legs.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Is this necessary?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
After.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Looking for you? Yes.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Your friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Not at all.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Yeah?
About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
Well?
But there's no --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
Don't know what?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
What?
Parked outside?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Well, yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
For the flat.
Well, she had problems --
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
You see, they don't really know me.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
So?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
No.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What?
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
David?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Forget it.
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Oh.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
I see.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
What?
What?
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Of course.
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Who said there were four?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Someone lost the key.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
That wasn't a question.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
If I think you're lying --
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm not sure --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
Here?.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
Would you like to see the rest?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
What're you talking about, George?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That you were just indulging me.
It's just -- fabulous. Think you could do anything for me?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
That's okay too.
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
No.
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
Wow.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
I don't care.
Calm down, baby.
Nummers.
What?
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
I'm coming, baby -- How's Otis doing, anyway?
What kind of treatment?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
What about?
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Right now, I just don't care.
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Okay.
God, I adore you.
Hello.
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
A little.
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
... yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
I never get my hair done.
No kidding.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah...
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
You are.
Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
I went to school with her husband.
Great.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
Well, yeah... you know.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Yeah.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You do it.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
You are today.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
No, thanks.
Well, I do.
Probably the bathroom.
Can't you do it out here?
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
No, I'm sure.
Great.
She's incredible... She loves you, George.
Yeah... I mean great.
Whew.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? Many times.
Do you? You still see him?
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?
And what?
Did you?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
I just have to do one little thing.
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
Well, did you or didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Yeah, baby...
You're a genius.
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
Sit down!
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
What about it?
Jackie, can we --
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
Fuckin' A --
-- what?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
I am you, you little bastard.
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
He never stopped.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- sure.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
Nothing.
-- mmm --
Mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- yes, you --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
-- well you better go after her.
-- you've got to leave.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Why?
Lester's on his way.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
No --
Well then what are you trying to do-
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So I'm saying it...
It's too late...
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
I don't know -- I've got to.
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
What?
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Wash her.
What with?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- Oh yeah.
-- Oh my yes.
-- Otis?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Not yet.
Okay... thanks...
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Okay!
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
I just... who what?
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
George, I don't --
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
What?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Yeah, baby.
Why am I great?
We live together now.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
-- Sure.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay... Night, baby.
George?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Great.
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Could I?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Go where?
Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Great... can we talk later?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Neither do I, baby.
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
Commercials.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what? -- I'll see you later...
-- okay -- -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Bullshit.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
What difference does it make?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
Jesus.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George...
Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
Yes it is.
In a way. But...
But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Thank you.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
They're not?
Sure.
Oh yeah.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?
Okay.
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
What about, tonight?
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
See she doesn't drink too much.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Yeah. How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I said sit down!
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.
No thanks.
Have a drink.
Okay, thanks.
I know.
I'll have to wash one out.
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
Yes I do.
I'm finished with her.
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
Come on by.
I'll call you back...
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
What do you mean?
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
You do?
Yes.
-- well, more than anything else -- -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
No kidding? Your own shop?
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
That's not very logical, Lester.
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Aren't you going to have one?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Who is that?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I know, I'm sorry.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
How much?
Jackie --
What?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Honey?
What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
-- Yesss?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Johnny!
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.
Well... sure...
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
You're going.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- he'll never know the difference.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
That's fine --
Jill.
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
-- just wonderful.
No... how long did you say?
Three weeks.
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Where to, Les?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
What was the Donner party?
They had to, in order to survive.
Come here for a minute, first.
Okay.
Yes, Dad.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad. Dad?
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't. I have too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
I guess so.
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
What do you mean?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
How does he tell you things?
Yes.
Do they know he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.
Try to think what it was.
Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Okay, Mom.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay. You behave yourself.
All right.
Okay...oh!
Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
No.
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
I won't, Mom.
Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Oh!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Is Tony one of your animals?
No. It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Yes.
Thank you.
Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Advocaat is it?
Fine.
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
And, er... where are they now?
Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
Grady... oh.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
All right, sir.
Sure.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Nice to meet you.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
God. This is the kitchen, huh?
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'll it be, sir?
Your money's no good here.
Hi, hon. How's it going?
Uh...huh.
Yeah.
What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
Hmm, nice.
Lots of ideas. No good ones.
I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing. How is he?
Good.
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
You can't remember.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Jack...
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy!
Stay away...!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Wendy...
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
Susie.
Well...
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
Great...
I'm intrigued.
Well, my predecessor in this job
Well, that is eh quite a story.
No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh...
Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
All the best people.
Oh, I'll say.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Yes.
How do you do?
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Eight thirty.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Fine.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Sure, Uncle Al.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Let me help you up.
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Will you?
Jane-
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
You're a real booger, you know it?
Well... it is his third.
What?
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Huh?
What if it's some kind of monster?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
Do I need one?
Good.
Save this one for last.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Will you do it?
But Uncle Al! You said-
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
Oh?
Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
Were you tempted?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
SING!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not.
'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
What you do?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
You know it.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road.
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
What?
You can handle this.
What?
That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.
Who? The other woman. Your wife.
Vince...
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
Yes?
Thanks. A lot.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Sure.
Good evening, Vincent.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my!
What is it, Betty?
Look at that. Get a gander.
Oh my!
HE'S SO FINE.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Right.
I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
You betcha.
I love my heddles. Show me again.
Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us?
I know. It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section. The beat.
Am I?
That man -- who is he?
Get moving. I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Were you wicked?
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
You know that song?
Whatever.
Um, I don't really know this one...
You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
Wet behind the ears.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Tell me about it.
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
What?
You know? About me? About everything?
Sing!
What? What time is it?
It's after five. We have to bathe.
Five a.m.?
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.
Three years. Sister.
Three years. A rookie.
A novice.
What?
Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
Are you sure?
Now you.
Experience! Right?
Right.
Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
You watch yourself!
Keep moving!
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Give me a C. A C!
Oh no. We'll always be together.
Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?
They're from my old convent.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.
Bless you.
It's true!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
Very well.
Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
The reason?
What?
What?
Your cigarette -- out.
What?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.
Can do.
Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy?
The vow of obedience.
Like to who?
I'm outta here.
Until sundown.
No food. Not until sundown.
Yes. Until breakfast.
That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
My what?
Your cell. Your room.
It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
Come, Sister.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I am?
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
You're my Olympic event.
And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
Please let me try. I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A vote?
The majority has spoken.
You have a phone call.
What?
I must go where I can be of use.
Good day.
Saving you. Move!
Oh?
You saved my life.
I'm a Christian.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.
Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Don't push it.
At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Think again! And get out of here.
Screw you!
Then-you run.
You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
No nothing.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
Pray.
You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I am?
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
Really? Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you. Personally.
You're not... seeing anybody?
No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different...
Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.
How?
What?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.
That's not the point! They need me!
Even nuns have to pee.
Yeah, like what?
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
Really.
But -- wait.
A hiding place.
They open a window.
Where's who?
You won't even tell us?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Who are you guys?
We didn't tell you what?
That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
I'm telling you!
Maybe.
Take care of it.
It's a bluff, Vince.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
It didn't work, Vince.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
So, take it off.
Which one!
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad!
Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
Neither did you!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
That's what I figured, too.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye.
She's praying.
Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
However, we can also pray for other things.
Measles.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
That was exciting!
He's decent.
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
It's no use. She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
She's our inspiration!
And what a lovely name. Las Vegas...
But how do we get there?
A Benedictine.
Christy.
Impossible.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.
But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
But where?
Yes?
We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
I know.
She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold? Can you try?
Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Find 'em!
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?
Many have.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.
Two days... ? For murder?
You must have missed your mark.
I hit him square.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I was afraid of this.
To place it inside its coffin.
What is that?
What are you spying on?
The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
A diseased monster.
... Brom Bones...
He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance.
What of it?
What?
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!
He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Pardon me?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Hmm? See them?
May we look at them now?
Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
He drowned. Anyone could see.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts.
Not Liberalism. Equanimity.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.
Believe?
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
At times I do.
Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons.
How could he?
Up.
The Western Woods.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.
Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
I have others. All I need is this.
Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business.
Witches do not exist. However...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs.
What happened?
Should we go back?
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
We should go.
Why this tree?
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.
In test... what?
Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
Did your father take a loan?
Yes. I rode with him on payment days.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.
You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.
Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know. Hold on.
Take the reins.
I doubt that's the end.
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.
Other people?
Small talk.
It might have been more. Might have been positively grand talk.
You are funny.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want. But...
I insist that you have it.
Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
They have done nothing of the sort.
Won't they still have that justice? Or, was it a vain promise?
No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think. I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
But, why? Tell me why.
No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What has happened?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother? Is she still alive?
She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about?
Katrina. Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
Just... keep where you are.
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
The skull is gone.
Yes. I did notice that, thank you.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Come with me.
He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
I do not know. Away.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
Keep climbing. I will follow...
No. Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
We have no choice.
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
No. She has gone out.
Where?
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine. Now, I must...
What... ?
Let her go!
Yes... yes. I think I will...
I can show exactly.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I didn't see none.
What did you say?
Turn around. Now!
Yes. Here...
You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.
The Horseman. Yes.
Sit.
Close your mouth! Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Father saw you die.
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
No.
I can't remember.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Yeah, me too.
You got any money?
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How are you, Bill?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Sure.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
French-fried potaters.
Yeah.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Give me the big'uns.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Okay. You don't have to though.
Karl's my name.
Yeah.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please Doyle, don't.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
No sir.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
That's funny. You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I thought I told you to keep out!
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Childers.
What are all them books?
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
Yeah.
How come?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
They still around, your folks?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Well, I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Where'd you get them flowers?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You want to go with me?
Yeah.
All right then.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
Yeah.
Why?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
I reckon.
Yeah.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Yessir.
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
I knowed you'd be here. What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I've got a feelin' today.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know. You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I know he does.
Mama?
Huh?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I reckon.
Yeah.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Me, too.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I reckon.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Yeah.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Okay.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.
I know.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Karl is a guy guy?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Why won't he talk to women?
Yes sir.
Yes.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
It's my birthday.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
And your father? Is he from New York?
American literature. What else?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Huh?
What about for you?
For me? I'll have the same thing.
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The Queen of England?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I didn't know you took pictures.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
How'd you get started?
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
But they're all the same.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
How old, kid?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Hi, Auggie.
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health.
Anything good?
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Yes, I suppose I do.
I mean, it's a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You're looking good, Auggie.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Like what?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You don't give up, do you?
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
You what?
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No, bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp. It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Huh?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset.
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I shouldn't have let him go.
No thank you.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
Five dollars an hour? I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Thomas.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Yeah? And why is that?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve. Twelve-twelve.
No, wait. You can't just walk off. You saved my life.
I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Rashid. Rashid Cole.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I mean breakfast.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
The what?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I don't have much time.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Let's not get too idealistic.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks.
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Come on, just a little hint.
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
That money is my whole future.
Well?
It wasn't my fault.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
If you're lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
You want another one of these, too?
Keep it tonight. We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
You don't.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
It is.
You done your math right.
Well, what if?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here. Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Happy for him. And relieved.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
Why not?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Well, it seems to me...
You're implying th...
I said. No further questions.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Why? We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...
The Japs did it.
I did. But the jury won't s...
It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know.
Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow.
Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Pretty darn clear.
Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
All right. What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection! Speculation.
He didn't want to lose any more.
That's how journalists. Answer questions.
<u>Were</u> you, sir? Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Oh, yeh. He said someday he would get his land back.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I have told the truth.
Since September. Last guys got transferred.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Three kids. What's she going to do?
Won't take two.
It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it.
Have a look. At nothing.
You're right. I better use two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
Yes, he was.
Fell.
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
The knife. What knife?
He hit his head. On the way in.
I'll take two. One for later.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point.
We have a warrant. To search your boat.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or hang back and wait.
I think you like learning.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it.
I want you. To tell the truth.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Maybe.
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
You don't. <u>Think</u> so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.
Sure, anything's poss...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
For the third time, yes.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been.
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
I...see. I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes. And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Why?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
Bull fiddle.
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls - from the top again.
Funny? In what way?
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
It's private. Go away.
Manhattans? This time of night?
What did he say?
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle.'
Hey, she's ticklish!
Those two musicians from the garage!
I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Yeah. Why?
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
We're not?
What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one. Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With you.
With me?
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie! I ought to wring her neck!
It's twelve bucks. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
They got the bull-fiddle.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town. But we're going to shave.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked. Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs? Are you crazy?
The name is Josephine. And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
I'm Josephine. Sax.
Watch it, Daphne!
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
Now you tore the other one.
Polish?
Down, Daphne!
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl -
Fight it.
But suppose I lose? Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Josephine.
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls! Daphne! Come on, help me!
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Yeah? Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
You - you -
This happens to me all the time in public.
Daphne - Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Of course, you're not. I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No. I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Oh, no! Not tonight, Josephine!
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers! How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no. I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I'm just borrowing them. You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry! You can't be serious!
Why not? He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
Okay, Joe.
But they're from Osgood. He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Since when? Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Drop her a postcard. Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve. It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope? But there are laws - conventions -
There's a convention, all right. There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
Terribly sorry.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
It's nothing. I just think us girls should stick together.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
Sssh. Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No. It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Let me warm them a little. There - isn't that better?
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I have a very low resistance.
I know where to get some. Don't move.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights. We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh. Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Oh, Sugar. You're going to spoil my surprise.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Thank you, Daphne.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
Vanity Fair?
It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Oh yes, we do!
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny. Josie - I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I met one of them.
What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?
Yes.
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those. I don't know. Mice?
Yes. For a whole year.
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape. Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
We could -
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
Yes, indeed. It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You invest in shows?
No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
You're not sure?
Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
I'm not surprised.
Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
No, thank you. I'll walk.
Who?
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Flower girl.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
It doesn't matter.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I don't care.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand! I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.
You ain't going nowhere.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
Oh, it's you! You got a lot of nerve -
Thank you.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
It's three weeks in Florida -
Because I got some plans -
Yes, Joe.
Good! Then you won't be needing your car.
My car? Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance. What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got to be under twenty-five -
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.
Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Better keep a lookout.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
I can't trust myself. The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Really?
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About what?
Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah. With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I want mine to wear glasses.
Glasses?
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Search me. I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
Seventy-five. That's three-quarters of a century. Makes a girl think.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Thank you.
Who are you?
Now, really -
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Your view of what?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
No, my flag steward.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele. And I sing.
For your own amusement?
Yeah. Real hot.
Oh. Well, I guess some like it hot. But personally, I prefer classical music.
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Please - no names. Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way. He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible -
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
I am?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
For me? It's Shell Oil.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Three?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Of course. On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
Trophies. You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Harmless - how?
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean - like frigid?
Have I? I'm trying all the time.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
What else is there for me?
Is it that hopeless?
Why?
Thanks just the same.
What is it?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
So inhale!
I'm not quite sure. Try it again.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful. Poor Josephine.
Me?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
I knew you would.
I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
PLEASE!
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Make is Scotch. A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Go where?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me? I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me? I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name? And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street? Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Why?
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
No, Spats - no, no, no - NO!
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except its Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. I promise.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
What for?
To make sure youre okay.
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Why, with you.
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Oh, dont be that way.
Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Um, just about everyone.
You are taking the piss?
I had to say something to get you here.
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Yeah, kind of.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
And you do now?
Doesnt look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
Hey, yourself. I see youve met my ex.
I have regrets.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
You have feet?
Youre funny.
Really? Dont get too attached.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Both.
Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Love.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.
Why?
Im compulsive and weird?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
A weekend?
A wedding.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Shampoo, got it!
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
What?!
I guess so.
What do you think?
Okay.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
I disappear. Its not about me.
Show me.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
Its my job.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Desperation?
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah.
I didnt say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whats with the nickname?
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Hi.
What?! No, no. You cant--
I have to. Im the best man.
Thank you.
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Therapist.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
You knew?
Im so sorry.
You pawned it.
Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And only rarely.
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Ahoy!
Its complicated, Dad.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
...but its getting there. 
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I havent thought about that in years.
Hard.
Is there any other way to take it?
You don't live around here, do you?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Let me see it...
Sometime, but not like this.
Uh huh...
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I try...
That's right--
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
Colored.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Sure--
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
What he talk 'bout?
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Yes mam...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
And so you did your job, right?
Yes, mam...

Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...

Act like one!
Thank you, Josie Mae.

He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night, Mama...
Good night...
Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
He can't get up, Mama!
Yes, ma'm...

Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .

No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright!
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I'm used to it.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Maybe soon--
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Might be...
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!

That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
I am the clitoris.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
There are more important matters right now...

Huh?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.

I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...

YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
What's the difference?
Dude! It's the V-chip! It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Wow!
I'll just try the first one.
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Me?!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
What is 'fisting'?
-Or monkey fucker-
Huh?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Right away, ma'am!
What the hell is going on?!
Oh.
SILENCE!!! NOW!!! EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, it was worse than that...
The F word?!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
But I-
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Oh yeah!
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
You bet, Terrance!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! You are a bad man!
And you call yourself a Canadian! I told you we should of done Leno!
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance. This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Canada is saving us!!
You did? Just now?
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
Do you always think about sex? I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
You don't care.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
I don't care! I want to talk about it now!
THAT'S IT! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
<u>WHAT?!</u>
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>

Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.

Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well isn't that great. Something to write home about.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri Koros?
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.
I'm sure I will.
Very professional of you.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
I did nothing to the monitors.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
My...wings...
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Look answer my question!
Well shut it off at once!
Well it's a good thing that I did.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why don't you reset and run it again. The pods check out ok.
Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
It's steady, good benefits.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate. Why don't you just go down there?
Uh...
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
You better start making sense!
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Taylor, you surprise me.
Good help is hard to find...
That's me.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
10-4 good buddy.
I know, I know.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control! What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
That's clear.
Over and out!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No. But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Don't say that! It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space?
Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you.
I don't know.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Great.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I understand.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me. Where are we going?
Yeah?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Sure.
Helllp!
The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown.
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare? A flare won't do it.
No...
Why? Where are you going?
What? What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I can't!
You too.
Taylor! Where are you?
Barnes?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
How does the distress signal look?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room! Let's go!
What do you mean? What happened!
We don't have time. I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that.
Except write our wills.
Marry you?
That's right. Will you marry me?
Good. In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
I don't know. Wave to them!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
He's up on the bridge! He's going to be OK. Now who's missing?
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts! It's too risky!
Homesick? It's only been two days!
Send it back if you don't want it.
How am I supposed to know?
Baby, take it easy.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
What makes you so sure?
The engines!
Mac. What's shaking?
Right, I understand that...
One moment please... one moment please...
Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
I'm from Akron.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
Nope.
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
No. I'm from Akron.
It belonged to my dad.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
When you get a chance.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
I hate fuckin' opera.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
I'd buy it!
See ya 'round Faz.
Sheila, meet...uh... I forget the name.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Seven years.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Wish me luck.
Theo.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Need some advice, huh.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
100 years!
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I ain't nobody's father!
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
The small ball.
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You wish!
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I'm getting to like it here.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
I gotta survive.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
You got a better offer?
No...
I didn't think so.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now?
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
You see what you did? Take your ball and get out.
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I found dad.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Cool!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
I don't want to play.
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior who?
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
SHEILA!
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
Nice set-up.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What if he wants to get out?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Why would you help me?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
After we eat, Dad.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion.
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
You still got the touch Junior.
Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Line up where you want it.
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Like this?
Yippy!
Who wants to know? Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it? The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
What do you want with my dad?
Business.
Won't your father help you with that?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
It's a vicious cycle.
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Why were you suspended?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Nothing.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
Plan C... ...is me.
Really? I kinda like it.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
So why do you stay?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
You're here.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
...lane six. Yes.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?
Too late for what, Sheila?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Why not?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it. He's my brother.
He's my father.
It?
Tell me what happened Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
At least I'll die smiling.
Fuck plan C!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Sez you!
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
Can you change something this big?
I'm not here to bowl.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Basement bingo?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain. Open the door!
Please, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
Dr. Levine, please! Return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher! Now!
I can't...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
How about I just press the button?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
How long will that be?
Two and a half days?
Yeah. I heard you.
But she's --
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something.
Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear it.
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.
But you've tested it?
Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Why can't I -- ? What the hell is going on here?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do you see it?
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
Captain. Right, forgive me.
What team?
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
Press? No, I haven't.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
Storm? What storm?
A thousand feet.
Then why am I here?
What?
What do you need me for?
Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Take a look.
I don't know. But it's something alien.
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know. That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
Just worry about yourself.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing. He's gone. He left.
He's here somewhere. Find him. The sub's on it's way. Go! C'mon!
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
But sir --
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
'81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Damn it, Edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Edmunds? Can you copy?
Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing. I don't know. Everything was normal. No changes at all.
Harry? Can you copy?
Send them, damn it! I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
They're coming.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him. What? Hello?
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
Sir! Sir, the door -- it's opening.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
In a minute, sir.
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I did.
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
A break for what?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor...
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
I have to tell you. It's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
What -- you want me to retype it?
She wired this system.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using suction.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What do you make of this?
Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here.
Ted, shut up. Are you packed? Ready to go? I want everyone packed. Now!
Sir, about leaving --
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
To what?
Internal power.
Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
Give him a chance. He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
Too big?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
I love secrets.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft. To investigate.
Underwater?
What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
Yeah. Drowning.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Good theory, Ted.
Get this thing off me.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you? What happened to you?
What?
You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, why?
And you didn't tell anyone?
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't. Which is it?
What?... Wait. Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth --
Beth.
She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What could have done this?
What are they?
Eggs.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Calm down, Beth. Alright?
Don't tell me to calm down!
What?
You told him about me?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
Beth --
No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta --
Why should I go?
You should know how it works. Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would. But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
Still clear.
You fixed this suit? Beth?
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
He what?
I think so, Beth. Yes.
Fixing it.
Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
Did you look? It was on the top shelf.
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
What?
Page 87. "I could never read that far."
What?
He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things.
But how?
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real.
But why is he doing it?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Antihistamine. For bites.
Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Doesn't say.
Beth --
To be on the safe side. I mean --
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
Only lab rats. Here.
For what?
Not believing you.
Where are you?
In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
What do you mean, different?
Your watch.
Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot.
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes?
Someone did.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry. "My name is Harry". My name isn't Harry.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
Beth --
It's either this... or I kill you.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not me.
From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.
It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it.
Leave me alone, Norman.
I know. You're too strong, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I --
Don't tell me about me. I already know too much.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Top shelf, is it?
Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home.
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Get away --
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
How's that?
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, they're not mine.
It doesn't make any sense.
I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.
By the bunks.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
You'd have to ask them.
It's an American spacecraft.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
What?
Just in time for what?
Another attack?
Like what? I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not. I'm not star--
Yes you are...
Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine. I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Time travel. A black hole.
Which one? Let me get the list out.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
No. I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
What noise?
It's like...
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Then explain it to me.
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
That far in what, Harry?
What are they?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
You don't remember that?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
You're clear. You see the airlock?
What happened to her?
What do you mean? She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
You didn't say that about the food?
She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.
That's right.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
You know what it is, Harry.
Stop what? What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Help me lift her.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.
How far away's the sub?
Hold on.
I'm trying. Shit. Here -- catch her.
Are you trying, damn it? Just --
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
I heard! I heard!
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
You got her?
I'm trying. There.
No idea.
Well, press something!
Wait!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth.
It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake.
What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Gimme some room here, will you? Back off. Gimme some space.
Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
That's right.
Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it?
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please. It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived? From where?
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.
Impotent? I'm not impotent.
"We are friends".
Thank you.
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir.
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.
Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
Captain who?
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Told me what?
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists? At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
You mean a picture?
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of. Why?
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all. Honey --
In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Four. Four years --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
What?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
They never used to send a Navy car.
I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
I'm not afraid of anything...
Not bad.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
May the Force be with you.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here. They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
What do you mean?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
They use the Bogan Force.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
These are doubtful times. The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
You mean we should go after her!...
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
Try to feel it. Use the Force...
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You look great! The uniform and everything!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
I've got it blocked. I'm all right.
What's that?
Forget it, son.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
I'll make a report later.
Send out a boarding party. Full assault gear.
Was this trip really necessary?
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
It's automatic.
Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
What are you saying?
Why?
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are?? See Threepio...
Not if this tunnel deadends.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Get Chewbacca. Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
Come back here... Where are you going?
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
Thanks, old buddy. I'll be with you in a second.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed. Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Who is this? What's your operating...
You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
He'll be well cared for.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him. Tell him we need five thousand.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.
Are you there, sir? We're going...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin about ?
What do I want with a scar ?
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
What about it, Diz ?
Not enough, I guess.
We're the old men, Ace.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sir, no, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
What's the hurry ?
Others are waiting.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
I got Games & Theory.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I'm getting better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Hey, check it.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Zander, please... Let's go !
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
So who's got time to get married ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Excuse me...!
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
You're upset, that's alright.
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
Is it true ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Zander, no...!
Your turn...
Who ?
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Excuse me...!
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
Shhh...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
Alright, I love you.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
That was just a mix up.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
How are you, Carl ?
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
No way, ma'am !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Hut... hut !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You saying you didn't ?
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
What ?
I'm on it !
All bands.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I wouldn't mind.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
No, sir.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Courage, I guess.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Hi, mom.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You can never be sure.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Move out.
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
What is it, Rico ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir...
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Who's that with you ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Who is V'ger?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
You may proceede.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
That is how V'ger will survive.
By the Creator.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Spock...! Get a fix on his position!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Engineering...
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
You are what...?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
May I ask Why?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
You asked my opinion, sir.
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
No!
This served the purpose.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
A tractor beam...
We have twenty-one minutes. Captain, we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
No.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Twelve seconds...!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is. Take me over, please.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Sit down, please.
I want him here. Sit down!
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Any reply from them?
Mr. Decker... ?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...! Engineering... full emergency power!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
No meaning... No hope... And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Precisely.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
The point...
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain! <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it?
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Nope.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
I'm goin off-shift. Come on...I'll walk you home.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Well, it had sentimental value.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
"Anguish."
I beg your pardon?
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Why did you quit?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's in your play.
Yes.
Why?
It's about life.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
It's...
It was either that, or a sardine.
That's true. You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Yes.
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech. Just you.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
That whole...
Everyday things...yes.
Really. With the porch swing and everything...
Surest thing you know.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...I always thought so...
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Yes...
...that.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...
Mister White is...
What are you doing? I love your script.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
You're still here.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance. Innit? "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
Me?
Yes.
...oh...oh. Well. That's very important.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
That's for sure.
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart. I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You got a paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too. You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
You going to ask me in?
Read the card.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
The other side.
Oh.
Why?
...because if you don't, they die...
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
No, I just broke up with him. I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Sure did.
Why?
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
Go you Huskies!
I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
I hurt you?
...her unbridled sexuality. That he...
...yes.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Where you going?
Going home.
What?
I told them what you said about the script...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No, that's true.
Is it...
Yep. N'it's for sale. One of the few things money can buy.
Gosh, you look nice.
...what...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper. Show you the plans...
It does?
Did as of last week.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
What?
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop. You know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
I saw...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you?
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies...
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
I have to tell you something...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
No. Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
We'll work it out...
That a fact. Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is. It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
What're you doing here...?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Big day last night.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Ain't got no courthouse. Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Hi.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...
Whatever it is. GO <u>do</u> it. How you doing on the permit?
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...why am I here...?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Waterford, Vermont. Where is it? <u>That's</u> where it is...
Now: I'm looking at the...
Fifteen hands.
What is that in fingers...? Just kidding, get me this horse.
This horse is booked.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Hey, Tommy. Heard your wife's having a baby.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
That Could Be.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I never touched her. My mother's gr...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
It's...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
I...
You got to get out of here...
I swear that that woman in my room...

You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
You can go...
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hobby. Okay, look Page...
Everybody needs a hob...
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
I've always seen that.
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
You mind...?

Well. What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um. You have a valid drivers license...?
Of course he...
Could I see it please...?

It's night.
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Thank you.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I think he's moved...
I, uh... Um...
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the...

Cool it, Babe, you started this...
She's absolutely r...

I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...

But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
Look, look there's someone else...
Who is that...?
That's my...
Oh.

I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...Please.
Yeah.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Yeah. Joe? Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>. I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Now, look. Claire: Listen to me. I want to tell you a story.
I...I...
Who are these from?
Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
Because he understood. That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows...
No, she didn't Claire. But I think you should do the scene.
I know, I know.
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
What? I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Bob are you alright...?
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Marty...
That's cor...
He's staying here? Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Put something in his room. What does he like?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
Uh. Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Did</u> I? I think you're mistaken.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Why?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Main Street.
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
Now: the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
This young woman.
And I've got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him. Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
Okay...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
Gut Yuntif.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm. You have children?
No. No, but we're planning to.
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You should.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Who's White...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
You bet he did.
Wait a sec, Marty. Call us back. Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
It burnt down.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>. Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I...?
I was in New Hampshire. I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Grace...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Where have you been...?
Why?
I hurt my finger.
Get a typist. Gettim a typist. Get outta here.
I know you are. Go you Huskies.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
For what cause?
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
...would you excuse me, please...
I can write it. I can't type it.
No.
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...? I saw it. I was there.
You were there. At...at 10:35...?
What glasses were you wearing? Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...
You told me you were writing. Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful. Ziz good, you try this?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Like dykes and dogs.
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...not the Lazyboy...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Sherry, this...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit. I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
And we're glad to have you here...
Why would they be illegal?
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<u>Whatever</u> you need. The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...it is?
I <u>am</u> the City Council. We meet Friday, and I...
George, that is so kind of you.
Yes, I hear it.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Mmm...
It takes all kinds.
Zat what it takes? I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part. Did pretty good too.
Bet you did.
Zat true?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
I don't care. <u>Fix</u> it.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I killed her!
Mommy's marrying Rache!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
I don't care.
Excellent point.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Mass hysteria.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
It happens.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
That will never happen.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen...
Why does Rachel scream?
During sex.
I live. In the same country.
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
I like talking about it. At least, to you.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Like how?
I'll be there for you.
Well. It's for you.
Are you <u>kidding</u>? It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
She knows every neat junk food place.
I bet.
Secret's safe with me.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And...?
She is but an arriviste.
Great.
Actually. I could only help him.
Not with my mouth open.
Good girl.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
You have to ignore him.
Oh, yeh.
Maybe twenty.
Mom? What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Don't. Take me with you.
I'm not.
Let me be the judge of that.
Yes.
Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad.
Good. That's very good.
Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!!
Here.
Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
He's badgering a witness. Eat.
Don't touch me! I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
Thank God for that!
This is my house too!
And this is my room so get out!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN? GODDAMMIT!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>. So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Not use my words, please!
No, baby. You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not.
Great. Big ears, too?
No. But they stand out, a little. Like this.
He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
That's my girl...
There you are!
Don't take my picture!
Annabelle put down that camera.
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Cos she loves you.
Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
Fine.
Then have a donut --
No.
Alright starve.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
That's nice Ben.
How could I be? We learned some magic...
Dad! You can talk him into anything!
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I have lava.
Lava's hateable. I never thought of that.
Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Thank you Ben. Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.
Where are you, anyway?
Yes.
Mom...?
Tomorrow? Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Nope. I got my warm t-shirt.
Pray. We never find out.
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
That's Rache's song!
Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
Before you.
Ben where do you have to get to?
How do you know?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Oh.
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
You dying.
Half. Of him.
So where are you?
Can I talk to you? When you're there.
No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we?
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
Actually, never. They'll always hate you. There's a gene for it.
Sure. I was just doin' my nails.
Every day. More and more.
At first. Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Let's take our best shot.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Duncan. I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Remarried. There is no move.
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
You think I didn't get that?
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
I'll call from work. We can have a conference call.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
You're WHERE?
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Don't do this.
And I'm supposed to care.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE are over.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
It's good. You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Yet another spaghetti night.
We're going to win this.
Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'.
I live or I die.
We don't have any coffee.
What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What did you do?
Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
I was in there in him.
No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
You got to hell!
Look, I...
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses. To break a child's heart.
Think twice. Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I don't recall inviting you.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I need practice.
I did it for her.
Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Not personally.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there.
Hey. At least it's not an editing machine.
No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Anxiety.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.
Wowie. How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You WHAT?
You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.
Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Nobody likes a snoop.
But I came here to...
Luke. Can't live like that.
Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes.
You're a cross-dresser.
That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Beats me. Ask your mom.
It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.
It's promising, this one. We're upbeat.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
And you said...
What else? Keep on keepin' on.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
How's she doing with Brad?
...go to the park. In the worst way.
No.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Feeling the pressure?
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.
He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Worked. Like a charm.
So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Oh please.
Shut the fuck up. <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Neutral ground. What's up?
Double.
Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.
I lost him. I was panicked.
Uh. You hate my guts?
What do I have that you don't?
Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
We have to talk.
Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Jesus.
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
But? But what?
But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry.
They don't hate you --
Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Not yet.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
We have the kids. Next weekend.
And it's <u>my</u> call. I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Our weekend. At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Rache, get out of th...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Rache, it may take time.
What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think.
It's no biggie.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry? You could make us something?
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I know that.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Hold your applause. We're not having fun, here.
Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
What do you call it? You told her you had doubts.
Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Restless.
Because you've changed so much.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Does Jackie know this?
No. I'm doing it behind her back.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Oh, yeah?
Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
What?
There are some rumors...
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
I'll be your guest!
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Great to be here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
No.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesus mi jesus
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
Poison gas.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I do. I love them!
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
We're not ready.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
We're not ready!
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Yes, Mikey?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Got a lot of homework?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
He's right.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Is everything OK?
I dunno.
How was the class?
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I'm going in there.
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Tired of this shit...
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
You're welcome. Dad? Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
OK!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Maybe. She's OK.
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.
Thank you for being honest.
Thanks.
Take off your top.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Oh, I don't remember that...
I do.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
Eight, six, and four.
OK. Bye.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I know.
Is it loaded?
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You should be.
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
No, thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Can I see what you have so far?
Sure um yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Y-yes--
Times up!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Why? Are we going dancing?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I'm not arguing. I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What happened!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.
What do you think?
Yeah?...
Used to Filmore, used to.
There's the fence...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
We're on sublevel six. We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Good...
It's nothing to worry about.
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
Where does it lead?
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Are you going to kill us?
I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
Yes, you should.
I don't want any...
I insist...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
She's still alive.
The transmission is an hour old...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
He's in there...
She's as good as gone...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'll let the senator tell you.
What do you mean?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
We're secured. Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Richter-we got a problem!
Excellent...excellent!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Gotcha. We've been filling barrels all day--we've got hell of a stockpile.
Good.
I say we head out.
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
If I don't get power up we are!
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
There's enough in one vial...
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
Don't be ridiculous.
I have your word, Mister President?
Yes, of course.
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try... 87 - 43 - 56.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue. I can assure you of that.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I know nothing of the sort!
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
That's right, fella.
One, two... three, four... five... Why you, dirty, stinking...
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What are you talking about, Major?
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
What?
What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major. Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
They told me, Major. And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Wait a minute. The President!! That's it! The President!!!
What about the President?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
So what?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
General Schmuck?
Yes! Who the hell is this?
What did you say, sir?
No, sir.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
What kind of trouble?
Yes, sir. He issued attack orders to --
You aren't sure!
Yes?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Certainly, General. Why do you ask, sir?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, sir.
All right, Major. I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
That's right. I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, sir. What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, Major. This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war? Have they hit any of our cities yet?
To you, sir. But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir. Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
No, sir. I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
That's right, Major.
Yes, sir. General, can I ask a question?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
And if that were true?
Because I thought it proper, Major. Why else would you think I'd do it?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I see.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.
Yes, sir. But so do we.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir. Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major. Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir. Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
What the hell is Plan-R?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But we can't communicate with the base.
Admiral Buldike?
Knock it off will you, General? Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
They're coming in now.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President. The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky. Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it. What's the wind like?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right. They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Fifteen! Twelve o' clock.
What?
War.
War?
Main interference linked to electronic detector. Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Check.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff. Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
They're moving apart.
Hang on, boys.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah?
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam! Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you! This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Shoot, Lothar.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
That's what I said.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Hellnno, Major. I was just trying to think the thing through.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes. All right?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master Kong.
All right, Lothat, that does it. Master safety on now until bomb run.
Master safety on.
Everything still checks out okay.
Binky?
He's dead.
What happened?
I bit his jugular vein. Now will you shut up and get up here???
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Quentin, how's your gear?
Recall what mistake?
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What are you talking about?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
How the hell do I know? Maybe the war's over.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Right. So how could we get any messages?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Then get off my back!
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College: Never under- estimate your enemy.
Sorry, King.
Forget it. Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
It's me - Lothar. Are you okay?
I'm okay. What's up?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Let me check.
Roger.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
Your a nurse?
Right now?
Yeah.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?
Shut up! Aw...
What?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Yes!
The dude wants it.
That's the rock star thing.
No, no.
Sorry.
Jesus Christ.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I'd get bored.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
So you can do an album cover?
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
In the limo!!!
No, no.
No.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
No.
Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Great.
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Yeah.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
In what way?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Buff is funny. God.
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yeah?
You better! Yes!
I will.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
This is private property, my friend.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Please!
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Well, play it, man.
Please.
I just started it.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!
Hey, thanks, man.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
A reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
I'll be in the car, okay?
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Okay.
Come on. Inside.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
Really?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Let's see.
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I'm sorry.
Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
We were?
Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Pony and I are friends.
It does look good.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
He's drunk.
Uh-huh.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Who were you talking to?
Nobody. Sooze.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Ask your girlfriend.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Good. That's good.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Yes.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, shit.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
You don't know?
No.
This is my home.
No.
Just put it down.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
That, that's Indian?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
I gave it to you.
Look, your trespassing.
I don't know.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
That's right.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Look, why do you care, huh?
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
Look, look, just get off my property.
You could've come over.
I know, I know, I know.
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No.
Yes.
Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
It's a piece.
Your sure as hell right about that.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
So you can give me more shit?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
About what?
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk?
Typical male.
Tim!
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
It got that close.
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
How?
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Us.
Of course.
And?
Come with me.
Nothing.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Mm-hm.
Mm.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
Mm.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Is that a threat?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
Just go.
Just go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
So how's college?
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe later. Hey! Hey!
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
What do you mean?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
What?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
You know what I'm saying?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Well, what about this?
Camel jockey.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh!
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Like?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Hey.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
You do?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Oh, my god!
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Really? What else does your mother say?
I think I gotta go.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Yeah?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Just one?
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I'm here.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Jeff!
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Oh that's nice for you.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
Look, it's really not my fault.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
It's twins!!
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine. I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee hee-haaa....
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Bye.
No...I've been pregnant.
Positive.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
And they get caught!
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know. Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet.
Well...
Of course - of course! Hands in...
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it? Hee-hee hee...
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady!
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
We're here for you, Diane.
He is the Great One...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
That you?
Yeah, hold on.
Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't use big bills!
For a pack of cigs? I use her food stamps.
Kim-Lo?
No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Wrong number Nooooooo!
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Ammo?
Bullets.
We're dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hannah, we've...
Kansas?
Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh yeah, you caught us...
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
You damn well better...
Yeah. "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she? How is the old girl?
Definitely old.
That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?
But you're not married.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Uh...maybe?
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Bank branch!
All of you!
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
They could kill you.
My what?
Your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Before you? Whoo-hoo!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I want to help. I'm part of this squad...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I didn't mean to --
Action! The scene starts.
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Come on.
Close, but no cigar.
Where's the bar?
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Sure. Bases Loaded.
About that luggage. Where's the phone?
Thanks.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows. How did you like it?
I didn't.
Thank you.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
How about the Rainbow Room?
I had a teacher like that once.
Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
Well....
Are you hungry?
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful!
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
What teacher?
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Into what? A lampshade?
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
I tell you this is half sold.
As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.
You sure have.
So long.
Why should you do that?
Sorry. It's your baby now.
I'm not good enough to write it alone. We'll have to do it together.
We're engaged.
Good for you. You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own. Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
So do I.
Came on back. Let me show you where it fits in.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
It will?
Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's who?
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
If you please.
It must be my new shampoo.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I just don't.
What is it you've heard. Come on, let's have it.
From Artie. What's wrong?
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
You did.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
Come on in, Betty,
You bet.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
Nobody asked you to.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You'd better. I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
Sure. Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Get out!
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
Why?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uh-huh.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
Only asking. I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I am not afraid. Read it!
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me? I'm busy. Just finished one script. I'm due on another assignment.
I don't care.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Are you married, Mr. -- ?
The name is Gillis. I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Okay. We'll deduct it from my salary.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
Just a scene I cut out.
What scene?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Not now, my dear. I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
Tails. That's ridiculous.
Come here!
Cute. Let's have some drinks.
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
Just follow me.
It's those feathers. They tickle.
Who?
The other guests?
A little.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What's that?
"Mad about the boy."
Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
This is the right day.
They're awful. They make me cough.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max. I'll get you some.
You're a darling.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.
Thank you, darling.
Yes, Norma.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
No you didn't. You took the car.
Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
Yes, I am, Norma.
No, you're not. Max! Max!
It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
You think I made that up about the gun...
You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Goodbye. Norma.
No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.
Wipe your feet!
Dressed for what?
Madame is waiting.
For me? Okay.
Thanks. How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks. Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Naturally. I brought them myself.
Is that so!
Why are you so upset? Is there anything missing?
Who said you could? Who asked you to?
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
Good.
They found your car in the garage. They are going to tow it away.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.
Uh-huh?
You send them. Is that it, Max?
I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
That's right.
What car?
Is that So?
You don't believe me? Look in the garage.
More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Along is no good. I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis. Not even if you were a relative.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Was it a sudden quarrel? Had there been any trouble between you before?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him? Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Okay. And let's have the car right outside.
Yes. Madame.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Very good, Madam.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
All right. Camera! Action!
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But what will happen?
What is it?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Softball.
But which one?
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
Sorry, mistress.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
It's what we were warned about.
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Am I? Still?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Whatever you say.
Yes. Whatever I say. From now on.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you mean we?
What do you want?
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Later.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
You don't like me? You hate me?
What do you feel about me?
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Just like that?
Like turning off a light.
But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
But I don't understand.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
She'll forget about us eventually.
What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Yes.
She has hostages.
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
I did.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Well, there's several ways to go .
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I bet they do.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Well, just one.
I'll drink to that.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
I know it.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I could force you.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
Yeah.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Supergirl?
Well...I guess I can't.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
George---I thought you'd never ask.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Theories?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a hot scoop !
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Oh, no thanks.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Yes.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for treason!
I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Where is Earth?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Can you create life?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
This is all your clothes?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not...an orphan are you?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
But what for?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
It was just a trim.
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I don't scare that easily.
A cheap trick.
Cheap but effective.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Not yet.
For what?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
That's home.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Criminals.
What? Palace? Hardly.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
Why?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Mr. Roebush?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Nope. Never.
I seem to be.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Clark.
You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You're welcome...??
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
It sure is.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Too much mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
Oh...I came close once.
I mean him.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Me??
There's a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Can I help?
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Anyday...
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
Kent!
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Sure.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
At one o'clock in the morning?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Gus Gorman.
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?
First paycheck?
Who gets it, the company?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
One. And a half.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Yeah. A raise . .
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
Say who?
Black or regular?
I don't think you understand.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Columbia.
Columbia.
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
When?
First question got to be "Where."
What?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
God, that's what I keep you for.
Greed! Let me tell you something---
Huh?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
For what?
A computer.
We've already got some.
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
Tell me more...
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
I was afraid you'd say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
What about you?
I'd wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
Anytime.
We've already met.
And this is... ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
Hey, Don't I always get there in time? Come on, relax.
The bridge...? I'd better get going!
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Whoopee.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone. And you're next Webster.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Gus?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
He can have mine. Anytime.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
53!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Why do I have to do this?
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Missing????
Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.
Hello.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Today coffee----
TOMORROW THE OIL!
We already have a super-tanker.
Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Don't cry, Bubba.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
We can get to work on that oil!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
She'll be fine.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh. . .
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I do?
Be my guest.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
In July???
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
What??
Lois, help! I can't -- I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I didn't think I wanted to.
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Let's go to my place.
Your place? Maybe I should change, Maybe you should, too.
Let's get you inside . . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
I'm fine. . . . . . What was I talking about? Before?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
You do?
Everything on it.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
What??
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
What else is ballast for?
You'll have to pack quickly.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
North!
Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Genius! -- Lex.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
Why didn't you go before we left?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I think he said a "curl."
What's a curl?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen. You do, don't you, Kent?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
DELETE IN CUTTING
North.
Why?
To ski?
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Constantly.
He has powers as we do . . .
Australia.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
I must be. But I'm not. Your home. This is your home.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
Cuba.
North. Keep going North!
Put down Lex Luthor?
I wish I knew. -- Oh, God.
Zod. Zod.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
And I will lead.
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Yes?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire. With a few of my own.
We must combine our strength.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Clark. . . !
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'm sorry.
Absolutely!
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
One hundred percent. And I like him that way.
. . . And very nave!
Superman gets mail here?
An angle?
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Get the box, nephew.
There!
He's . . . beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
What?
This wasn't in the plan.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Bunkers!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Shut up, apple-polisher.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
We're running out of smoke.
Not you. You. Tell me again.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
What's she doing in California?
I know.
I know son, I know...
North. It's north
I will.
Well!
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
No.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Not...gray.
Not really, no.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
But otherwise it's swell.
Unbelievable.
What the -- !
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
I just took a shot at it.
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Oh.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Not unless you can fly.
Come again?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Is that what they're calling him?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Super...man. Hmmm...
You're not the only one.
You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I'd better get you down.
Oh.
Okay. Take me to your leader.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.
First the pets, Otis.
He's from another world.
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
I didn't say a word.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Bingo!
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
La de da da...
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
What do you suggest, my dear?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
Ready.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in --
Nothing.
You?! How about me?
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
There was a recipe on the back --
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps? Let's have it.
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy? Let's get high.
I didn't bring any --
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
Tea?
You got wax in your ears?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Lex is going bye-bye.
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
Then -
But so is Vond-El
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Two.
Gets you where you live, huh?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
What's your name, boy?
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
All of us.
He sure as heck does that.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us. Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He'll be weightless.
Well, physiologically, he... won't quite fit.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
Enjoyed it?
I guess I got carried away
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
How good it felt -
Okay, but...why? No offense.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh. Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
Oh.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Pink.
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared. What are you waiting for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Excellent, Otis. But what took you so long?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.
I...uh...check.
Otis...
It is for me.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
But...why?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen -- you're busy -- and it's a long story --
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
And garbage doors.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Alison Jones.
Ally. That was my nickname.
Ally. That's right.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm fine. Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that. But she's well?
Yes...fine.
And Zoe? How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.
Sunnyridge. That was a long time
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going. To see her.
She's in trouble?
Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I understand.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help.
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
Okay.
Yeah.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh. Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
The children.
She's resting. In her room.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine. So...stay out of it.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Can't you make it later?
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
No. It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus.
Sure.
Just like we look forward to this.
I better get back.
Good night.
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
Why did you do that, Billy?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
From what?
No. I saw it on his face.
Berries.
Berry-picking.
Yes. The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
With our hands.
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
What's that, Dolores?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Yes. He does.
Billy said that?
I did.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Excuse me?
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
Yes. Abbot understands these things.
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
Away from your crazy Mom.
No. A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over. It's fall.
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
It's interesting.
Yes. It's a present.
From you?
It's the truth.
No.
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
That's what he said.
It's like a song.
Oh.
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
Okay.
What, Mason?
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
Okay.
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
I'm absolutely positive.
Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last.
Was the bus on time?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say. I might have...some business here.
She...she was a friend of mine.
When?
People who will help our cause.
That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos.
Crafts.
Crafts?
Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
No.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Thanks.
So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news.
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.
No. But this is. They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
I need money.
What for?
You don't believe me? You don't fucking believe me?
Of...course I do. I just thought...I could get you another
Yes. I can hear you breathing too.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
Poached salmon.
Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.
Well, let's see what we get.
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
Please.
You've been retained?
Yes.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Excuse me?
No.
No.
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by.
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Yes.
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
Yes.
Why were you scared?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Positive.
Yes.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.
Why not?
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
There wasn't time?
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
You remember this?
Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.
Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
Of course.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
I am. Really. It was awesome.
Nothing.
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
Don't even try to remember.
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Sure. I'll fix it right away.
Oh. I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to.
How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.
Okay.
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
There's talk of that.
Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
Yeah, right.
The Ottos.
You don't know that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Hitler!
Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I only had a few hours.
Robard's my client. I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
I see you're full of human feelings...
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?
No, I'm not. I'm not!
History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
No...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Susan!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Bonna sera, commendatore. Come sta?
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No. You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I have a message from your sister.
Everyone knows Manny Davis... ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You print them, don't you?
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Why not break it up yourself? You could do it in two minutes flat.
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll listen one more minute.
When?
How?
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
I read your column every day...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
What does that mean - integrity?
Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Talk to her yourself...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
He's leaving early. After this "set". He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
- He's got them on him.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Yeah... And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'... You know J.J....!
What about?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure. Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
At the bar - Sidney...
No. That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you "interviewed"?
In his apartment -
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Hello.
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
- that's what I mean!
He wants me to break a leg?
But...
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
I'm used to you...
Take a top coat.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Nothing...
Yes.
I know you do, Sidney.
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
If you want me to -
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now? On which bounce?
Good! We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
See me in my office.
You tell him, I stutter!
Yes, but why?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
What ship?
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago. Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel! Drop dead!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this. What can it matter after tomorrow?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Steve, stop it please...
Why did you call me?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Oh. I can't, honey. I'm on a roll here.
Shut up! SHUT UP!! Motherfucker! It's all your fault! IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
What chip?
NO!! We're going all the way! You got that, Dyson?
In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Let me try mine.
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
Yeah? Who sent you?
Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Radical.
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
I would.
Max.
No. Only an object of equal size.
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Of course. I'm a terminator.
Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
Why?
You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.
Right.
What?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Cool.
I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
That's great! See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You will.
You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.
No problemo.
I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She's gonna blow him away!
Drive faster.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Where you going?!
What?
Terminated.
Yes. Throw it in.
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it. Please... don't go --
I order you not to!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Yeah, she's a total loser. C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
No! Don't kill him!
It, John. Not him. It.
Alright, it! We need it!
I need to know how Skynet get built. Who's responsible?
I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
I love you, John. I always have.
I know, Mom. I know.
Go! I'll finish here.
Ready.
SHOOT!!!!
Oh. Yeah. They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle. I need you so much.
It's John who's the target now. You have to protect him. He's wide open.
Don't quit, Sarah. Our son need you.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one. Now don't move!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Unknown.
So do you.
Correct.
No.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Then what?
Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything. What he looks like. Where he lives. Everything.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Can you get us in there, past security?
Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go.
No. There is another chip.
Yes.
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I don't know.
But I promised your mother.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm very sorry.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Some.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dim-shits'?
So what is it?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
Yeah.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?
Colonel. Pleasure.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Not yet.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I have a duty.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes.
Three months.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
And your father was executed.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
No. Ours was damaged.
What's in those files?
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I can't do this. It's not right.
What's not right?
How come?
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Why were they going to arrest you?
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
No!
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
Von der Null?
And what did he say?
I have no idea.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never. Never.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show you?
Do it, Helmuth.
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
So. You wanted to see me.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yeah?
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
One of your people told me.
One of my people?
His private life?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Sure.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
First oboe.
Come to the office, please.
You're late.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I won't let the fat kid down.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Just what you see, pal.
You know your weapons, buddy.
All.
Wrong.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Great.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
I thought you did.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha! Is she young?
Yes. Don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
No. But you will. It's very important that you live.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.
One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.
Right.
Tell me. Just start at the beginning.
Freezing.
Come here.
Kyle.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe.
Caught one? You mean you got shot?
It's okay. Forget it.
Forget it? Are you crazy? Let me see it.
What?
Just talk. Tell me about my son. Is he tall?
You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
You volunteered?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You'll learn.
You like it? It's my first.
Okay. Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
Why?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
Fuck you! Let go of me!
I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...
Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl. You know.
No. Never.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
Kyle...
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
We did it, Kyle. We got it.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
The year 2027?
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay. Okay. But this... cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
They've already been identi- fied. There's no doubt.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.
Okay.
Six shots at less than ten feet. Weapon was a large caliber--
I know.
I put a cigarette out in it.
No. Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Call her again.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases. Where you going?
Suspect westbound on Olympic. Grey sedan. Has hostage, repeat...
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
The stock will turn.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch. If your father could see you now...
What?
No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.
Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see." Night, Nick. Best of luck.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'll be right with you.
Please, don't do that...
A bad month. You did the exact same thing to me last week.
It was an accident.
Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I said I was sorry...
Oh, no... you.
I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
Alright... okay...
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note...
Hold on... They want your driver's license number.
What... is... happening... ?
A game?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
You should be.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
Home.
How do you know that's the way?
How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience.
Never mind.
Why not?
You first.
It's much easier this way. Come on, step up...
No.
Please...
I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
Oh. FIne.
My hero. Let's go.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
What's C.R.S.?
Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...
They'll love that.
Yes... well...
You're a grown man. I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
Me? You're the one who... ! Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
Why... ?
I think not.
That tall, bright building. Near there.
Investment banking. Moving money from place to place.
Hm? Oh, yes.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
I don't spend much time looking out the window. I'll call you a taxi.
Right. Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Keep it.
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Come here...
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
I thought...
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay? Be right back.
You?
Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
I don't...
Wha... ?
Not here! They can see.
Nicholas...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out.
I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead...
Get out of my car!
I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee.
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
What?
Scams, con games. How many?
I don't know. A lot.
What do we do?
What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
You call them...
They will! You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
... what... ?
That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
Just... wait. Just wait! Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
Fuck you.
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
I saw them kill him!
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Let me show you...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
I have to show you...
No!
Claire.
Claire. Pleased to meet you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
"Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one.
That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They'll be wanting it back.
So do you. And to think I was worried...
About me?
How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
Never better.
Elizabeth?
Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her. So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
Yeah.
You need anything?
No.
Really?
You shouldn't have.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me. Call that number.
Why?
They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them. Trust me.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises.
I know...
Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait...
They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know? I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire. That's all.
How do you know?
We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.
Okay... okay.
Really?
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're part of it...
What? Connie...
No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop!
This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Yeah.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine? The waitress.
Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Did she?
It always is.
Yes.
Have you gone to the police?
And, they didn't take that watch?
What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...
Yes.
I hope.
I'll call. I really will.
I know.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Oh, here we go...
What is?
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Physical?
Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
It's all down to this...
It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
Hey, everyone -- snack time! Here... here you go...
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor.
No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but...
What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back.
Shut up. Cuff him to the rail.
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first. I might have some clothes below.
They were my husband's. My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
Don't take another step.
Have we met?
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you. Goodnight.
Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Fine.
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you. Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight. Where was she?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Your brother. Will you come with me?
What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Where's my brother?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
No.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I know who she is. Take a message.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
What gentleman, Maria?
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me? I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Why are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is?
Friend... why don't you back off.
Nice touch. Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Wanted to wish you luck. Not that you'll need it.
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable. I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
You know you can.
Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.
Nothing else?
You're joking.
Sam... Thank you.
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
What?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
Obsessive worrier. Join the club. And you? I'd guess...
Who's Watts?
I did okay.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Greetings.
Yeah.
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
I've read your tests.
There's a carriage house around back.
You get your money.
It's a question.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
Just stay there, Nell!
Luke.
He must have left. Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You could have.
Yeah.
You want company?
Maybe someday.
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
We can't stay here looking for her. She doesn't want to be found...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter. Please, please give me clearance. It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Well... we're glad to have you.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I got more scared.
I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study.
No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
Why?
I don't know.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Nell. You will come here now.
No --
What?
How'd I know it was for you?
That? That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Yes. It's perfect, isn't it?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo. Luke.
Mary came with me.
It's okay... we're all here...
How could you do this to people?
Yes. But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
Nell, what do we do?
Oh! You scared me.
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
So far.
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
What do you do?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
I know.
You're okay.
Yes. I've missed it.
No. The world has missed you.
You, too. Happy tossing and turning.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good.
Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
David.
David? David Watts? Can you hear us? David! Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Well?
Red. What else?
I think so.
Okay.
I do.
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
Sure.
We all did.
It must've been a time. A golden moment.
I'm a gracious host.
All your life. That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
I sure hope so.
We think?
We can't find ... ... two of our guys.
Why not?
Because --
Come over here.
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Okay.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
What did you tell them.
And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
You think I'm staying?
Let him break - he likes to break.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
No problem. If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item. Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market.
Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home.
Eduardo. Rama.
You're home, then.
No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
Snuffed her.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
Y'what?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Not me, man.
Well, there you are. Jen must've liked him.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
Has he?
See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Those aren't guards. They're valets.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
Faith.
You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.
You steady on, man. What the fuck else did you do back there.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
What post office?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hell, no. I started writing.
No, but I know what he means.
Hard to miss.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Try calling me again.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
Modelling.
In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
Footloose and fancy free.
Yesterday. Afternoon.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are muckers.
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
Where you get your bank statements.
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Right.
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Are you serious.
Have you ever known me not to be.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
On what. What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone. You want his number.
And how did you get it?
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you. What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight. What about just now?
Just now? Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away. Or is all this just new to you?
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Yeah, well, you're here now -- -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I've got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
Black market during the war.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it. They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
So what's your beef, pal?
Eh?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right. The deal.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
What am I doing?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Where is he now?
He had urgent business in the north.
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
No kidding.
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah. Cheers, mate.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
No rest for the wicked.
Where else?
Nine years? Is that legal?
Could do, yeah.
Yeah.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
The forever kind.
Good luck.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive. Good idea. Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
I don't know.
The L.A.P.D.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
So what.
I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what. You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Lemme break.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
Something's on.
What?
You bet.
Like what.
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Walked.
You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I doubt it.
I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson.
Jennifer Wilson.
What do you think?
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
No trouble.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
Go now.
Have we met? There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London. I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
Yes, Ann?
And you should tell Doris...
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Yeah. Thanks.
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
We've certainly missed you.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah... it's nothing.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Birdy--
It's OK...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
No. Uh... family friend.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ah.
Well? How'd she do?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Did she make mistakes?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Sure.
Maybe.
You're out of line, mister.
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah.
Cash.
Cash?!
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
Uh-huh.
Look, uh... Creighton...
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Mm.
She's a rare one.
How's business, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
What is it, Dave?
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
But it's...
Please, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
OK.
Come on in.
So you paid the guy?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
Just coffee.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
I, uh... thanks.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Mm.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
Ahh...
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Mm.
I didn't say a word.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
How are you?
What happened to you?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I knew we'd pay for it.
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
No thanks, honey.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Yeah.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
How d'ya like them apples?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Whuddya mean?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
What the hell are you talking about?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
The hell with it, Eddie!
Uh-huh.
Huh? No.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
My *wife*?
He's the dead guy.
What'd he say?
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Yeah--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Yeah?
Hello.
We're just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Homicide.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Under arrest for murder.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
Great.
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.
Why not?
I'll go down and speak to him.
You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
Calm down. I found it!
Let's go!
Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun.
Eight to the right! Look! I found it!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
Where's the head?
Whose footprints?
Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
You're kidding.
Unfortunately, no.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.
I believed them.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Correct.
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh? Great idea.
May I see that?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something.
I know.
You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
I'd say we're in its home.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Let me help. I can take care of everything.
Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
I'm not giving up.
You must.
Let me see the plant press.
What are they?
They're eggs.
Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
Don't stop now.
It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped!
No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
We will.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed. These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
I wouldn't be so sure.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
Not really. Just the sub-basement.
I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.
Footsteps!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken. This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss. Come on.
What is it?
I don't know. But I think it's bad.
Not that big.
Like this.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head back.
Not yet. Let's try the fork to the left.
Keep the light up. I can't see.
Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel!
Holy mother, what is that?
Get back! Now!
Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Keep the animal quiet.
What?
Frock's been fired.
What's that?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
It's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself!
How about lunch?
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Okay.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You have time to talk?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
How did you know that?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
A monster?
No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
Behind me. Over there.
All right. If you're positive.
No. I think I'm hallucinating.
Gone.
Wounded?
The planetarium!
Vince!
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
Oh God! Help!
It's coming. Run.
What?
I have to shoot.
Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye.
You have to. Do it now!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji? What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu. For how many?
One.
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
<i>A month.</i>
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter. I'll make other arrangements.
No, hold back...
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's on the ClockCam?
He gave it back to his father.
All prop cars accounted for?
What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.
Why would we--
Sweep the harbor.
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Thank you.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
Of course.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue. Operators are standing by.
I'm the creator.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i> Then who am I?
You're the star.
<i>You</i> were real. That's what made you you so good to watch.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Shhh!
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right. Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend? Of course you do.
No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
No.
Saturday?
Now.
Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I think I've studied enough.
I...I can't.
Yeah? Outta what?
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Yeah, what happened?
Trust me.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i> Mixed up in what?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed.
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
How about them?
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
What exactly?
That's the "Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Really?
Truman? It's me, Marlon. I need to talk to you.
What's that?
The thing that started all of this.
It's a surprise.
They're... perfect. Thank you.
I won't be late.
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Every time you and Marlon--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on it--or ice?
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
What?!
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Uhuh. There's no accident. It's just more stalling.
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Do something...
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
Truman, stop it!
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
Oh, just so.
--Darling--
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
You got it.
Fine. I'll tell her.
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
There's no one here.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore."
Were you there--how do you know?
You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.
You can count on it.
Yeah.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
A woman? Work.
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Sorry. Don't have one.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
They took her --
Me?
Yes.
Yes. I know.
Working with?
Agent Mulder.
Yes.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Is it an emergency?
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
There are complications.
Kurtzweil, we think.
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
Looking for him for what?
What's that?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
No. Don't bother.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Yeah, I did.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
How?
You can't.
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
What did it look like?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
Your guess?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
What happened to playing a hunch?
It's locked?
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.
Something sweet.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Why?
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
I was until about an hour ago.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
And you're looking for?
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This is great. This is fitting.
-- of what exactly?!
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it...
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
I have no idea.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
For the purpose of what?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Yeah...?
Run.
Come on!
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
Just like that --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I need you on this, Scully --
I think... something stung me.
No -- it's --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
On whose orders?
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
Thank you.
About what?
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Where's Scully?!
I don't know.
I'm not taking any chances.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
Yes.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Driver.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
My life is over. Go.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
And Mulder?
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can. We all believe that...
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
I don't want to find out.
Shush.
I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
No.
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why did we stop?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
No. No.
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's wrong?
Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
You don't know the procedure.
I know him.
Do you think that's funny?
What then?
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Peter, okay?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
Yes. I am.
Like hell "wait."
Little boy?! That's him!
Carl, do you know? Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine.
Absolutely. Abigail...
Yep. Eloped.
Good for them.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
So you say.
I got it.
No problem.
No. Thank you.
He's beautiful...
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I bet we can fix it.
Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
That hoist, with the winch...
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Initiating connection.
I think that's the whole point.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
Yes.
No.
Absolutely.
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
I doubt that.
Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Grandparents. Live over in Davis.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Now?
Now.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Pregnant. Thanks for asking.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck." Wanted one just like it.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
No. Can you get a man close?
What else do we do?!
Next time, tell me, okay?
But you looked so cute. All sleepy...
Considering where I've been...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care.
Ja, ja, ja.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Give her some cigarettes.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
Mmmm.
I was told there were only two men there.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
They're forged.
Why?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Dr. Winkel.
Whiskey.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Well you read this.
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell you what?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Where is she?
Tell me more.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wait here.
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
I don't know.
Why?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Have you?
He told you, didn't he?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
Oh, the usual things...
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Of course.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Yes.
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
There's nothing in them.
I have never seen him.
No.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
It's true then?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
I don't...
Good-bye.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
No, not yet.
Thank you.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
Schmolka!
When did you see him last?
September '39.
Once in a while.
Holly Martins.
No, sorry.
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
No.
Him dying like that.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
He was...
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
It wasn't petrol.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
A bruised lip.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
In Vienna...
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Take him to Sacher's.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I know a very good dentist.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Heard of Harry Lime?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
Certainly.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Of course, of course, of course.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
You can help her.
Holly...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You wouldn't do anything.
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
Zwei zwartze.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
A Roumanian.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the name of this girl?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Yes.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
I understand...
Not necessarily.
English?
Who?
Mr. Lime's. Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What does he say?
You saw it?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Who else?
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
And?
You don't mean that doctor?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I am not a bad man.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Funny?
Something wrong.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not necessarily.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Not when I get interested.
Yes.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Never.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Okay.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Here.
Just take it, OK.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Thanks.
Traveler.
Good morning.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
Nice work.
There is one problem.
One or two kilometers.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We're ok.
I think we're about half way.
What!
A fin!
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
Fuck off.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
You can swim?
Two.
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
We swim.
Swim?
No.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Richard, you know something -
It's just the sky, Richard.
Where did you lose it?
So?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
They sound like you.
He's an asshole.
What??
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Yes.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
You will.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What's he care about?
Killing himself.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
You can't.
He's at a home out here.
No.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Oh, yeah...
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Why?
I'm good at languages.
Why not?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Yeah, it's stupid. Put it on, or I won't teach you.
You can't curse in front of it either.
Good question. Both. Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
V'asitem...
What's it about?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Do they?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Lina, come here!
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.
You gotta get out of here.
You don't own this place.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
What'd you say?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
How would you kill him?
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
It's the truth....
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
What's that? Okay. Surprise us...
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Female...
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
No.
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
The arguments, anyway.
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
This is me.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
It was a nine millimeter.
You're lying.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
No!
Yes!
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
That's meat.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve's going to explain it.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Isn't it true?
A Jewish prayer.
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Number ten.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
Get out of here....
The mother.
What...?
Here...
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Christ...
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
I have an idea....
Just do it.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Shut up...
Why me?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Four. But no one this important.
I can tell....
How?
I was a Jew in a previous life.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What's that?
What are you trying to say?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
What do you think you should have done?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Do I give a shit?
Exactly.
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
He was funny.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
We think you'd be good at it.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
And let us say...
What do you mean?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Of course.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
... So am I.
What d'you mean?
The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
The documents are forged.
No!
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
Italian is practically the same thing.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
I think I'll have a coffee.
In a lake.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Have you known him long?
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Italy!
No.
Okay.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes...
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
I won't, I swear.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Don't.
Why?
That idiot!
Lira?
Dollars.
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Six seconds.
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Eh? Si! Avanti!
"That"! This is not a "that"...
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
I didn't say... Brussels!
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Try speaking to me?
Fine!
No...
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
Enzo...
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
You're the best, Enzo!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
... You married?
Forget it. I was joking.
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
What?
Your mother?
... And his friend, Johana...
Get in the car!
Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
No! I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
No... in the hut.
Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
... Okay. I'll try.
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
I don't know... why?
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
My wallet.
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
I don't know, I just feel it.
Uh... Yes, of course!
I did?
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uh... Ah! A story?
It's me again.
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You'll understand.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.
... Nothing.
You go back, I'll walk.
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
I saw how it has to be.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
You are the father.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Ah?!
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
No.
What?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
No, no. Johana is visiting me.
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
He doesn't hear too well.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes?
The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
That's different! What's the matter with you?
... Sally?
Again?
They got the new T.V.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
You called the police?
They're going to send detectives.
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
Yes... It's magic.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
In the spring when he melts!
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
Coffee might be nice.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Then, goodbye.
... Yes?
Let him sleep.
What's up?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
It's Esther.
Please, call me Mordechai.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Yeah, no kidding.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Sure. Why not.
I said, do you come here often!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh. Okay.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'll be in my office.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
He's still working out some identity issues.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Take a look.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Worse.
That's some cold shit.
No, it was the perfect level.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
Resting?
It's Friday.
Why not?
That depends. How much money has he?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
I don't know -
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
I sleep it off.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
They don't say it to me.
Let's get in your truck.
Up at the museum.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
No. I'm serious about this.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Who?
The elderly man I told you about.
What are you doing that for?
Go on -
Let me see it 
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Tomorrow -
Rosita  I have wondered -
What, senorita?
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I'll miss you too, honey --
Good evening.
I want to ask you something.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
No. I'm quite sure.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Yes?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
We're old friends.
More or less.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
About Charlie's leopard?
Yes.
Charlie likes his leopard.
I don't know.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Some other time.
Just barely possible - - yes.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
That was a calamity!
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
It's not for me. I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Why?
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No - not yet.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
The red dress? No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Now look what you've done.
Don't be soft.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
And did you find the leopard?
And not a sign of the leopard?
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Yes.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
That doesn't make sense.
You. Us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
What! You can't be --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
How do you know?
We will 
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know -- Teresa -
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
When will they be back?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
That depends what youre looking at.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Anything is possible.
Disney! How inter...
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Sorry?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
No!
My brother hung himself.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that?
Something like that.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
To get me killed...?
No. Not us...
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
You wouldnt understand.
The dead can wait.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Crow what?
Croissants.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Croissants. Like that...
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
Youre a long way from home...
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Im fine standing, thank you.
You... Jesus Christ!
By your Austrian?
Yeah.
I know where to look.
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
Do you know a friendly cop?
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ...
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Have we done business before?
Why?
This is a bad line.
What sort have you got?
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Where is he?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Who? Martin... Hes Martin...
No... No... I swear...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
The company. We all work for the company.
What company?
Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Whats the Ambassador?
B-Black...
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
I certainly did, sir...
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
La what?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
I hope its not too significant.
What if it is?
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Okay. Recommended...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
My rates...
Jah...
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Clients come and go.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Dont jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
I told you... The rabble, its me... Huh... Its sad.
What is?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Yeah.
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
Should I come back in five minutes?
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Ill be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Should I be?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Er... Yes...
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Fine...
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
I... How long have I been here?
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Excuse me?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Cinq cents.
Viens.
Tu sais o me trouver.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Alors quoi?
I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Gluck.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
The acid bath?
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Thats what he said...
Shut up and walk...
Its a good guess...
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
So... pretend it's not a game.
10,000 gold crowns.
Tremoille... don't. Please...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Right. Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
They've started the battle without me!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Well...
Come with me...
Yes...
It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it. I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Tell me...
Tell the king to give me more men.
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
To marry you.
To be killed in battle?
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
But that was her order!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember. Maybe.
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Guess.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
The English??
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
Last night.
Praying.
The voice was in your cell?
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Many things...
Did it give you advice? Good advice?
Yes...
Is it here? Now? In this room?
And may I go to Mass?
You have nothing to regret...
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
So how would you put it?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
... to ensure our privacy. I need to talk to her. Alone.
Noooo!
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
That's enough! You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
That's not a lot.
20,000 gold crowns.
Yes... they were.
Good. Where are the English?
Everywhere. Where is the food?
Good. Can you bring me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Sooner is better than later!
The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
Me too...
Yes. We can pray.
Good idea...
No good? This is a disaster!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
The English are rebuilding it.
Perfectly.
No... not like this...
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Reinforcements? Where??
Jeanne, look behind you.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do? Bring them up!
The clothes are not important...
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not? He has good teeth...
Because... because you just can't!
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Here -- take this instead.
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
Not for long...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
It's not possible...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing. I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes!
Who?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Why not?
Because... I have to be alone!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What signs?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh? You can't remember? Let me help your memory...
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Really?
Really?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...
Good. But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
And what does he say to you?
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
Jeanne, be patient.
I want to be with him always...
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
Really?
Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
Wladek, please.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Wladek, please.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I'll see you...soon.
Dorota.
Come in! come in!
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
He'll be here soon.
Just over a year.
Dead.
Christmas. This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What are you doing?
Let's find out.
How will we sleep?
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.
I've no money.
Who told you?
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Who's recruiting?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
It certainly was.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We use what?
Just shut up.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I know.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're out, aren't you?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?
They were taking you away.
That's also my business.
Hungry.
You'll be deported.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are always notices going up.
Not this week.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
You made contact?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
It's a little cut, nothing.
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where do you live?
I am... I was a pianist.
A pianist.
In the attic.
Show me.
We're getting out.
Not yet.
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Szpilman. Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
To be deaf?
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Yes, like a cave.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Ohh the tag is broken.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
And where did they get married?
The Alps.
Ohhh I've never been there.
Yes, it's unholy.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
On your property?
Yes
What for?
The piano.
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Yes, I suppose you would.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci. UNSUBTITLED
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Nothing just yet
You don't want to learn.
No.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, not words.
I'm sorry, I can't do that. I don't have the time. Goodbye
They are washed.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
I just want to listen.
What happened?
He chopped it off
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
It must come.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
On your piano, that is the swap.
You've missed this bit.
She never gives him a turn.
Tomorrow.
Do I know any gigs?
Play a song then
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
7 to 2. That ain't bad.
He'll probably fall down.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened? He get ya with the knife?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood. No wonder you got hit.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
What makes you think you can trust him? He didn't do shit.
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.
Coupla days ago. I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
No. Never saw him before. He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
What?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.
He's not comin' in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
We'll be waitin'.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
The bastard. He can blow his nose all the way.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I like griftin'.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I'm busy, Floyd.
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
Good lad.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
All he's gotta do is read.
You sober?
I can talk, can't I?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something. I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.
Why?
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
Neither are we.
Let him wait.
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
He'll show.
I thought I'd lost him.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
That's why he won't know it.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then. We'll give him the shut-out.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Lonnegan.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 500.
Raise 5,000.
The name is Lonnegan.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for? I haven't done anything.
Think nothin' of it.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
I don't know. Depends what train I get on.
Sixty-five.
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
No. What's wrong with the front?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
No. They're just the only ones we know of.
All right, when?
Well we can't talk in here. They're having the place painted.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
He cheats.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
Maybe a couple million.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
I'm in.
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
No.
He's right, Les.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, figure something out.
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Don't think I know him.
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
On a 6-1 shot? The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I don't know. He took it hard.
All right, get outa here. You're outta work.
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
Never heard of the place.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
I think he will.
Come on, gimme a break.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
No.
Sorry. Don't know a thing.
Yes. He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh. I'll do my own typing!
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
Just a minute...
I can't find him. I've tried everything. I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose..... ?
Nothing.
You better take a drink.
Another young man.
It's the same one.
That is, if it's all right with you.
And if it isn't?
Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
Don't cry.
I can't help it. You don't know.....
You've got to get your mind off this.
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
Why not?
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
No.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Shush!
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
I don't think you will. It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
Thanks... we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
What do you mean?
Hello, there!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
You don't remember me..... I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
Disappeared!
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
No. The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
Oh, thank heaven.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
Hello, Nick! And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
He's been dead for three months.
Forgive me. How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Yes, she would.
This is my wedding.
If you think it'll be all right.
Where are you going?
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
He's all right.
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.
He's a brave man.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
I'm very interested in that body.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
She could tell you where father is.
Not a thing.
Was there much blood?
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
know. But I saw him -
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
So you say - Go on, Bob.
No.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
No.
He's holding out on you.
Let's go and see. Taxi!
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
Nunheim!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
I'll take care of him.
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
--was Wynant's.
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
He did!
About three.
Did you go?
Yes. But he didn't show up.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Well, thanks. We'll call you when we need you again.
I see.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
That's nothing. I saw him myself.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning, Lieutenant - Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
Where were you?
Marian! Marian! Don't go! I'll behave! I'll do anything! Don't go, Marian!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated... just because I haven't money.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right. All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
Why, you said...
Never mind.
So I see.
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
I'll give it back to you .... all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Yes?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Good.
That's all right.
So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
Never mind.
I wish you'd count them. There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Well, let me do that for you.
You might do that. Get me a ticket for... No, you don't!
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
That's all right. What are you drinking?
You don't say --
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
That's all right.
Slim.
What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
You're always teasing.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.
Yes...
Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be living in the lobby.
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he? What did he say?
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand -- Cash -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner. Nice food, isn't it?
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Oh, this is Andy --
He's well-trained. He'll behave himself.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant. What I've gone through --
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
We need ice.
What are you drinking?
Rye.
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
What are you going to do with it?
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Maybe it would if I took it.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Breakfast.
What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
That's great. I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels.
Want a drink?
Yeah.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Well, didn't you?
No. It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it! Please take it!
Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Catch me letting you go alone!
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Sure.
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
No. Nobody but you.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects! They won't come.
Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
No... no.
Yes. Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
He's a good guy. He sent me up the river once. Hey, Nick!
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase. It's at the Grand Central.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You did.
Y-yes.
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
It's a fortune box.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
Oh, God.
No, please, not again.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Low on gas. Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
He's not so--
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Break it out.
Yeah.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
Let me see the map.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
So we wait.
Move!
I heard!
All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
I told you; don't push me around.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We're at war.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
Get out of my way.
I out rank you, that's why.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At-at-at-at-at. At-at- at-at--
Knock it off!
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
I did it! I got the box open.
Wait. Wait.
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home. It's that easy.
Roger that.
Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
Oh, that's fun.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase.
It's the only way. We drive!
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
Millionaires, man.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Yeah. I know. I'm with you.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip.
Mine.
Mine. Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What are they doing here?
The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
It's giving.
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
What?
Jesus, Jaeger.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
How!?
We'll find our way! We'll...
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
We need something: A flare, a signal mirror.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
They'll search the pack.
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
Is it all right if I stand up?
What? Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
You sure you want me too?
Okay. Then we go this way.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Yeah, I guess we should.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
I don't have a weapon.
Shoot them!
We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
You were shot. We were standing right there, you were shot!
Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
We go this way.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
What?
He'll slow down.
He's going to slow down.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
The photos.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
Okay.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Oh yeah. Accidently.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
Now you need me.
What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
Yeah, you're funny.
I could.
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
What?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
It's a container. Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
What?
With...with millions. Millions of dollars.
Yes!
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, no.
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You have to go with us. You can't walk back...
Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy. I know that.
We have to do something.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
I think we found something.
He lived through that?
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
You want to say some words?
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them.
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary. Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Correct. Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Violation?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct. Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Correct.
What happened?
4732...?
Too low.
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Vocasity
No, Tetanty.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
What's the matter with you?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
Eat your dinner.
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
When?
Now.
Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Don't go.
I have to... he's a G-34
You don't have to... I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Looks like dirt.
That's not food. Can't be food.
Looks like food.
What?
I said what time is it? How long was I out?
It's 3+27 hundred
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
No! Don't go.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there. I have to go.
I'll try.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
No....I though I'm afraid.
You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
But...you...
I don't know.
You don't know. You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
We're leaving.
What?
We're leaving.
Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.
But you can't. We must escape.
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went. He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air. He looks out of breath.
Incredible!
No, look! Three degrees from the central azimuth.
You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.
What?
What?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
Don't say that. You look... You're not well.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going....
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
What?
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
Look!
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
No, I...
That way.
Look more closely.
What?
Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
I don't know.
I don't care.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
All the insides are gone!
No!....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Shut up.
No?
No...... She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
All right...
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
I thought of something.....
I can't understand. The sedatives....
...to me. I think I'm dying.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Thanks.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
No thanks, Bev.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Mike Reilly.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
Where...?
Hey, look--
Drive.
I don't know. You tell me?
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
Bingo!
`Til we get a better lead.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
What?
You don't have to talk about it.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Be right back.
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Me, too.
You got it.
Off the scale.
What do we do?
Right.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Which one's which?
I don't know.
What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
Easy, guys.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
"Punks", huh?
We work fast enough for you?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Hey, I'm next.
Helluva fuck factor.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Taylor's dead.
Thank you.
He's my brother...
People are dying.
Alex-
I know. I warned them.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
What? Nobody, I-
Shut up! Who is this?
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuck factor ten.
Look who's talking, old man.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Ain't that a shit--
Quiet!
It's about this.
What?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
IRA - instant retirement account.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
That feeling won't last long.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Sir, I--
I'll do it.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I thought I told you--
Report on the case so far.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Yes.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
Very well, Jacques.
In a moment.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
<u>Niente!</u>
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
You see-- No, no! And <u>yet</u>-- <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ... Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Good morning. I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Doc--!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.
I want to see--
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron! I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Yes, Baron. Thank you.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Just a second.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
I've got to see you.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
No, Captain, I tell you--
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!
No--proud. Very proud!
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
I'm crazy about you. By the way, your pin.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
What time is it?
Gaston Monescu.
Gaston!
Last year? It can't be that long.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
The six--
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Darling!
What?
But it's not enough!
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Five, seven, and nine--
Yes! Now don't worry!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
Lily--
Lily!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Neither do I. That's where I found it.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Oh!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
Make it out to cash!
As you like.
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Isn't that wonderful! You see, madame--
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father-- which, fortunately, I am not--
The same thing.
You're hired!
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Correct! Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Goodbye.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>! Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Please!
No--thirty-five!
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Thank you. Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
I don't believe it!
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Giron...!
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Jacques!
Please! Thank you.
May I?
You see-- Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
About what?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous? Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Right!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
How much is your salary?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Well, he was in the navy.
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Well, where is it?
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
You're certain?
Hurry, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm tryin' boss.
You are, Lewis. You rolling?
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Get that outta my face.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Rose Calvert.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on.
So do I.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
She knows.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I felt like black.
An accident?!
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
Can I bum a cigarette?
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.
Almost as good as you.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Bollocks.
Well I can.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No, but we're making excellent time.
We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Excuse me.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No you won't.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
No.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Could I speak to you in private?
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Just some sketches.
May I?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I see you.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Sure. If you like.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
To the stars.
Au contraire, mon cher.
It's okay. I'm alright.
This is crazy.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Right.
He couldn't have.
I know, I know.
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Right.
It's so cold.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
I'm so cold.
Never let go.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
I should like to see my drawing.
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Goodbye, mother.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do. We can't stand here.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
I never want to go back....
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh-- --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Yes, yes--the air-- --I'm getting plenty of air. Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like. See you again, I hope.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Thanks.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I think you do.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<U>Gladly</U>.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!
Where's Lother?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
Get moving--
Not at all.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
And me coming in with two pair--
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Sure! Excuse me.
Want to take it back?
I'd <U>like</U> to be. Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--are you?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
Yes--
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more--
Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Well--breakfast? Lunch?
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Tell me.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Wrong again-- But I dislike possessive women.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Anything I can do? I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent? I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
For once I'm dead on the level-- --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Lonesome?
We'll let it go at that--
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Yes--I remember--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me-- I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Come on--let's take a swim.
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'll be waiting on deck.
Jimmy!
What's the matter?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it. Here's seventy cents.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll watch for him, sir.
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Come on-- I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
--there's thousands of 'em!
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Thank you, sir.
I'll take one.
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella-- Here's that twenty-five hundred.
<U>Me</U>!
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Think again--
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No--not quite.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Good night!
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
I'll go with you.
Swell!
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
Thanks. That makes us square.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
What'll I say?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Cut it out.
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
I can see you're no gentleman--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
So what?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
I thought I put you to bed.
Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
She's in New York.
Who won?
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yeah--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Yes!
Are you happy?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
No--not much--excepting--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Very--
Of course--but-- There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
You don't shoot squirrels.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Somebody's got to do it--
Well, let's hear the poem--
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How." Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Good-night, folks.
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
What for?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Easy kid--easy.... Come on--I want to talk to you.
Eh?... Oh.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs-- --Ace of Diamonds.
Better unlock the door. Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I sincerely hope so--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Thank you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
"Smooth's" the word.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
What's the matter?
Nothin-- --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Aren't the roses beautiful?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Telegrams.
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Does it hurt? A lot? Good.
Just this minute. I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up. Going into business.
Nice voice.
That's not what I meant.
Yes, very. And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Not now. I don't have time.
You will after tonight. Bet on it.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Where do you think? I stole him.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...

Revenge? For what?

Easy Morg, don't think about that now.

It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's-
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
Wyatt...
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
None of my business, Fred.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sir Elliot.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
What about the gold?
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I'm sorry.
Him? He, is a she - at the bar.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
- We all want what we can't have?
Not all of us, 007.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
- Four wheel drive?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Nothing.
Do you?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
Just hold me.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Come on. I know better than that -
Well... If you insist.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Not from forty feet.
I see...
Hey - the world is my office.
Let's take a look at the body.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
He tied one on.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Wait a minute - I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
Depends what number you write.
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
I didn't think so.
You too.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
Sidney Winch.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Let's not make it a habit.
I hope so.
Think about mom.
- The family jewels?
- You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Thank you. "Now hear this: Drop dead."
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
Trust me.
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
... We have time for that?
Don't say it.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If not?
We blast through.
Next time, I do the driving.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Now.
Of course. Minister Johnstone.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Actually, you're just in time. Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are. Deadly little things.
Stop it!
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Remind me.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Mandarin. You jerk. I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Who's Wade?
Captain Morton.
I was an attorney!
You leave me no alternative.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
No -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Yes -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Excellent.
What's wrong?
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
...I see.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
My timing always was lousy.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Excellent.
Approaching the first gate.
Start the grinders.
You have to leave -
You come with me - You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Get more men up there!
I should have hired this man. Get somebody up there!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
It's Bond!
Kill him! Finish it!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
What's in the box, General? What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Will the cruise set it off?
Yes.
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got something to say.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
What is it, noontime?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
How old are you?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Why in the h...
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Like muddy waters?
It was nip and tuck.
Babe Brother.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Go back to sleep.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I will appreciate that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
It's healing now.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
I'll be right there.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Tolerable well.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.
Good afternoon to you.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
That's nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
My mother passed on years ago.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
When did you talk to Harry?
Don't shout!
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
You know the man next door is near death.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
It is so considerate of you.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah!
Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon!
Okay...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Sure! I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet! Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.
But what if we leave them behind?
Bye, house.
What? What is it?
Woody! Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
Here! In the car!
See? Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Let's let Molly open one.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this!
Rocky! The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Watch yourself!!
Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y. Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I'd better take a look anyway.
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!
You mean that happy child?
Trouble?! Where?!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Go away.
Sorry.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Where is it? I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Shield your eyes!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back! Back, you savages! Back!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Don't tell me what to do!
Shhh!
Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
It's ok. Everything's under control.
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Look out!!
Woody! The rocket!
The match!
Hold still, Buzz!
You did it! Next stop. Andy.
Not today!
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
What's with him?
Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I can't see a thing!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I got dibs on his hat!
Miss. G-6.
Ohhh! You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
How 'bout three out of five?
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Look! Janie!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her! NO!
Patient is... ...pre-e-epped.
She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Outta my way! Here I come, here I come --
Have you been replaced?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Alright! That's it!
I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Nothing.
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Toss 'im overboard!
No, no, no, wait!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Okay, save your batteries!
Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go?
Hey look! It's Buzz!
Wait! There's a nice little one over there!
Woody? Who's up there with you?
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Sir! No Sir!
Okay, thank you. At ease.
Yes SIR!
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
Last present!
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about.
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry!
I can't quite make out --
Uh-oh.
Sid!!!
Huh?
What?!
It's busted.
That's right. Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Got it.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Speed up!
Slink! Hang on!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
There's no mirror.
There's not.
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I did like the music.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Didn't you know he made things?
Home is where the heart is.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
What did I do wrong?
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
Ah, come on now!
Finn -
I'm cold.
I finished it off.
You did what?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
In my pocket.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.
Storms?
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
You're late for breakfast.
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
It's all right, Finn.
I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried?
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
No.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
Nine thousand dollars.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I can't do that.
It's the same. What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right now --
What?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
Me, too.
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Barbara --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
Me, too.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina. I'm a Czarette. Like Anastasia.
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
I got that. How was your day?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
I don't know.
How long's the job?
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Fuck you. I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
You can't make me.
Oh, yes I can.
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's. All A's.
You do? What else you do?
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like. It is.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Nope.
Who do you work for?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass. We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke. Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
I don't know.
She's your girlfriend. Open it, talk about your kids.
Depends who it's from.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Depends on the state.
Arizona.
Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I being cynical?
No --
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Not Tiger Woods.
Especially Tiger Woods. ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
We're playing!
Yeah!
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
We can protect you.
Carl and I were friends from childhood. He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes. Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
You will dine with me from now on.
You don't? Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Not in...
I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego. And we have a deal.
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
I don't know. Something.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again. Everything's back to normal.
The police won't find your car.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
Not this time.
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
No.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
This is a very different proposition.
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
It was an anonymous tip.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing. Nothing really.
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
Everybody has a weakness.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
This is a business. Get the fuck outta here.
I need to find my daughter. I'll pay you.
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
She snuck away. And we haven't seen her. She hasn't come home.
Oh, man --
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
You want to help? Stay the fuck away from her.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Agents who died in the field.
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
He's a research doctor. You're dad's a doctor, too --
What kind of research?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
It's three a.m. I'm not supposed to be here. I snuck out --
No. On you go.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Christ.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You've stabbed me, man.
You were in my way.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Ninteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
Aye, OK, Fr. But the good times couldn't last for ever.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Can you not go yourself.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
I'd fucking kill you.
I guess you would, Franco.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Great.
What?
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Shut up.
What?
Out.
Come on.
And don't make any noise.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
So why have you told me about it?
What? Steady like?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It's an interesting theory.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Eh? How's that?
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Fuck, OK.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Sorry about last night -
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
There's no need.
It's no problem.
No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
No. Me Neither.
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Yeah.
But try too hard --
And you might get the fucking job.
Exactly.
Nightmare.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Would not say no, would not say no.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
You don't know, do you?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
What do you mean?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking television.
It was just an idea.
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Well, it's up to you.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.
Stick it on my tab.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Are you serious?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
It's fresh air.
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
What?
A walk.
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
It will be your chariot!
You doubt me?
He doubts me.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
The ship....
My pain?
It runs deep. Share it with me.
Rescued at last.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
All right, we're lost. But we're making good time.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Plotting our new course.
New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
Pavel.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
Raise shields.
But the shuttle-
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
I don't have a clue.
A Federation starship.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Oh, please.
No, but you can bet they will.
Understood. Kirk out.
It's all I have.
What do you know of my pain?
Let us explore it together.
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
But how?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
If we could send a distress signal...
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Transporter room. Status.
Go, Sulu.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
I cannot be certain.
But he does seem familiar?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Who is it he reminds you of?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Why?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If you think it would help.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I did not.
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
How do you know?
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
That's a little vague, Spock -
A "t."
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Hmmm?
Uh-uh.
It must be all those marsh melons.
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain. Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
You are mad!
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Because you, too, must know.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Spock...
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
He's not?
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
Hi, Flynn.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Did he say why?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
To warn him.
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
For being on to Dillinger.
What -- ?
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I'm certainly not.
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Yeah...?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no... You're a bit.
For sure...
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
No...
Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Let's get outta here.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Yes. It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Cute.
End of line.
I'm sorry -
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
The Pentagon?
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it -- ?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
No good...they might block off the old chip. This way.
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Yes.
How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Let's get some power here.
Why? What are you going to do?
Jump.
Probably.
Shhhhh.
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Tron...?
Recognizers!
Alan-One...
We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Come here.
Little more juice's all it needs...
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
End of line.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Do it!
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
How?
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
I'm shocked.
Yeah. You know Harry.
Simon? Ohmygod.
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
Where are you going?
Out.
Where are you off to young lady?
I have a book report.
Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Fine.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history.
Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you?
You're kidding.
Yes.
Why?
Probably because it sounds scary. *
It's Talkradio. You're on the air.
In the helicopter.
What?
For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing.
Yep. Sleep fast.
Here, check these out.
What?
She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
Fourteen, Harry.
Right. She's only fourteen.
I thought you moved out.
Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Yeah, right.
Uh huh. Want me to lose them?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of * Beavis & Butthead. *
Stay on him.
And make it fast. My horse is getting tired.
That's it. Get 'im Harry We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Son of a bitch!
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
She's having an affair.
It can't be. Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
It can't be.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about? We have that.
Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, but for who? *
He could be working her to get to you.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
The purse is still at the house.
Whatya talking? I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe. Clean as a --
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
You're welcome.
Sorry.
But you didn't. Why not?
I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
No! Never!
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
I adore it.
I'd like that.
I agree.
Yes what?
Uh, yes, it is important.
Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
Not exactly.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure. Say that now.
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
Okay.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay. It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Good thinking, honey.
Yeah. It was great.
I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah. I suppose he is.
Yes.
Why?
What did you need?
No.
Answer the question--
Do you still love your husband?
Yes.
Louder please.
Yes or no.
What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be--
No. Doris.
Sure, hon.
I'm not wearing any.
Let the hooker go. She's not important.
Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this.
You wouldn't believe me.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
Yup. *
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No. But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Looks that way.
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
What?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
As much as you used to?
No. Much more.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Wait here. If you have to use this, use it. Don't choke. Okay?
Dance?
Absolutely.
Sorry. Trade secret.
Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me.
Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot. Her thighs steam.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going!
Go ahead.
I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are?
So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Hold that thought.
Fuck you.
Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?
Yes. Go ahead.
I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone.
Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert * operation. And this one got a little rough.
Cairo was a day at the beach next * to this.
Yes.
You recognized my style. See, you're very good. You're a natural at this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them. Hardly worth * talking about. Two won't bother * me again.
Yes. Now go.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I'm married!
Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
Helen.
You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this... You opened it.
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
His wife.
His wife? Good. Bring them.
Hello, Alabama.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
What letter?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Yes.
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
Knock wood.
You can't have just one.
This is great, we got cable.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
How come?
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, hush up.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
Now hang up.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
The oriental.
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
I took a cab.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Sure. Why not?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly. How come?
Would you like to get some pie?
I'd love some pie.
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What's your favorite color?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What's your favorite movie star?
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turn-ons?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
At the movies?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Uh-huh.
You didn't do nothing.
Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Who?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Will you be my wife?
You will?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
I just gotta get somethin'.
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
What?
I think what you did...
What?
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit. He eats it.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
You'd really do that?
He don't got no right to live.
If I thought I could get away with it -
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Tomorrow.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
Every word of it.
For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
It'll get ya high.
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I know.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.
The zoo. What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What's to think about?
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case.
In case of what?
Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
What are we gonna see?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Three kung fu movies.
Yeah, OK.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
No.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
No. Not yet.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Me too, Boris.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
We grew up together.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I bullshitted him.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I can, but I don't.
That's about all I ever eat.
What?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
I got some money I can give you -
Keep it.
I give up. Who are you?
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Step inside.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Not a tiny little vial -
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
That's bullshit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Read my lips.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves. We'll get back to you.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
Shut up!
What are you going to do with us?
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Meaning...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.
No.
Why not? Most people have some ID.
You wouldn't understand.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
I have to go.
A jail? Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air. This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean. No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
This is April, right?
July.
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
1995?
1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No. That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
What?
No more drugs. Please...
I have to do this, James. You're very confused.
1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here!
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
What?
Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Clues? What kind of clues?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...
Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...
I did him a favor. Now come on.
I've got one now.
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
Jeffrey Mason?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.
I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot! Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that? You were in prison?
No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.
The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
You know -- your plan.
It's private.
A lawsuit? You going to sue them?
Not, "what", babe! When!
Monkeys. Twelve of them.
Plan? What are you talking about?
Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this.
The phone call, man. The phone call.
The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You really want to know?
No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist? And now she's spray- painting our building?
You want to go in? Examine him?
Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
Tight? My watch says 7:30.
Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Christ no!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Think you'll live that long?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I won't hold my breath.
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
Nothing.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
That's my morning's pay.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
Will be.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
You got two years on me. What's that make me?
It is not.
No it won't. You just don't know shit about statistics.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Yeah. Just a little short. Figures. I just wanted to get out, that's all.
You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Ninety-two. Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
You got to be more careful. I remember one time--
Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
Another accident? You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man. I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, you better remember that.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
We're closed. Come back in the morning.
It is morning.
Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
What's it to you?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
I think I burned my gun hand!
It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Yes. Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
John--
Who the hell is this!?
Wrong number.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
How could I? I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
I don't hear anything. You were dreaming. Or maybe the wind blew something over.
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
Jake. No. No!
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
Drove into Sierra? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
What happens if you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Come here.
What?
Lift me down.
Like you.
Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Such as?
Games?
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I can't.
Jake.
From?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
How much money has he got?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Lied? What do you mean?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
What are you talking about?
Kill someone. I can't do it.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Jesus Christ! Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace. I can't do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What was I supposed to do?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
I don't know.
There has to be!
You're calling Jake stupid? You!?
Don't yell at me! I know it's here! I know it!
I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
We're going all the way. Together.
No.
What about him?
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.
To get my car.
Wait. What about . . . him?
Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Funny thing.
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Not me. Us.
What?
You heard me. Count it out.
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
You killed him!
He was going to take the money.
Just drive.
He was going to--
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
Grace!
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
What for?
The trunk. It's locked.
It's not locked. I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No. I swear it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Yeah, they'll find you. Dried up and twice dead.
You idiot! You'll kill us both!
At least I'll have company when I die. Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake? Should we trust her? No? I didn't think so.
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Grace, tell him.
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna. That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Hungry?
No.
I'm surprised to see you. I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning. In your car.
That was just loose talk. I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here? That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How do you put a price on murder?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
Make it twenty.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
And tell her what?
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
SHUT UP!
Thirteen-thousand dollars. Had you done it. Isn't that what we agreed on?
You think that's a lot of money?
All I have in the world.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
No.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say. I don't even have it yet.
Darrell giving you problems?
He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
There's another reason? It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Mexico? You're going to Mexico?
No. He gets shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Hello? Hello!? Operator, I got disconnected. Hello . . .
Yeah. What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Not as bad as it looks.
Nope. No problems up the road.
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car. Nice and slow.
Sure, Sheriff.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
Soda. You know.
No!
But, Senor--
No police! Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
No police!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
Christ no!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
...And everything is nothing too.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You know I won't be seeing you.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Mexico? You going to Mexico?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Grace, tell him.
It ain't broke.
Say, what happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Darrell's a moron.
Live there?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
No!
It's not what you think, Jake.
You came to take my wife from me?
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
What are you talking about!
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll kill her!
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
Darrell--
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Great!
Time.
Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
Another accident? You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
That's none of your business. Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No.
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
Soda. You know.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
Drove into Superior? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Come here.
What?
Lift me down.
Like you.
Beautiful?
I have an idea.
And what would that be?
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Kill him.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
No! You get it!
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
I'm not coming back.
It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought --
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
What are you talking about?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
My mother died in this canyon.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
'Cause I love you.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
Get in.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
The ticket is 30.55.
I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Heineken?
No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Oh?
Wrong number.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
There's someone in the house.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Like you helped her, Jake?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
Is Noel in?
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.
Oh.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I had to put him down.
Yes.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
No.
What did I say?
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.
What does that mean?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I know.
He's asleep.
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Yes.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh shit...
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
You use your sleeve.
Yes.
out again?
Jesus.
Rust?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What was that?
We're supposed to be honest.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so.
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
I've come to understand that... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
We've already begun.
Is there a problem?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
But not a knife?
Like what?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
One last question.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
We are.
Yes he is.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I won't make any noise.
In under six seconds. I've heard.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Why'd you do that?
Just one--
Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What things?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
How much can you lift?
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I lied.
Two hundred and seventy.
Get mom.
All of it.
There's no more left?
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
Know what?
You're secret identity. That man was right.
Elijah was wrong.
You're lying.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Jeremy listen to what--
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Is that right?
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Is David Dunne there?
Okay.
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
No.
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Why?
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Where is it?
On a bench, across the street.
No?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Innocent of what?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
He said...
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Ah, I see.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Building his porch!
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Nope.
He give 'em names?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
You ain't dead.
Scouting?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess. There's still a payment, ain't there?
Advances?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Oh. Yeah.
You want... a free one.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Yeah. See?
She back in Kansas?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Oh.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Oh yeah.
Alive?
Uh... a little, maybe.
No?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Yup.
All week?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Letters?
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Uh... Duke.
Duke.
But he was called...
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Give it to him.
Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He's... he's dead.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He hanged him? Shot him down?
A sign on him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
N-no, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Yeah, I guess so.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
About what?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Huh?
Been gone near three years now.
Oh.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
No.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Lookin' at?
You don't recollect!
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
What happened, did you hit him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Yeah.
After a ways.
Shut up, Kid.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
You can shoot him.
Yup.
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Yeah.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
We all got it comin', Kid.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You better get on back, Miss.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed. M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
You sure you ain't armed?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Yeah.
Huh?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
Eleven.
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
She gave me the evil eye.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
No. I mean... ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much.
Yeah.
He hit you?
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
How far kin you see?
Fifty yards ain't bad. Guess we better get along.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I know it's rainin', Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death.
Easy, Bill.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Easy, Bill, easy.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Two.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Two more hogs got the fever.
Best we move that pig.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
The Kid, yeah...
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
Did I what?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
Who said that?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Thought you was followin' me.
Nothin's bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You gonna share your half with him?
Yeah?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
I don't like the question.
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I don't kill nobody without him.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Just like that?
Hell, yeah.
Bear with me here...
There's more.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Goddamnit.
They just said they wanted time.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Alright.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.
Umm ...
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I don't want to know.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
Dig.
Can we stealth these guys?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
County. I was in for fraud.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Never heard of him.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
Maybe more.
No killing?
Not if we do it my way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
We'll make it.
Who's Keyser Soze?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
Just do what I tell you.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
You know damn well, dead-man.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Mr. Soze will be most -
You're lying.
Am I? 92 92 INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Business or personal?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Someplace else, then.
Where?
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I'11 find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
What lawyer?
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
What happened?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
I don't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Abrams...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Ah. How did they treat you?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... yes. Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber...
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office ...
What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...I was one of a group of...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Tell us.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
It's a crime.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand ...
We just ...
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I...um...
It was good of you to meet...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes? Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
) I'm sorry ...?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
Is this a bad time.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I...do you want me to leave?
You do what you want. You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
Yes. We've all got to let go.
No.
What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...? What's going on here ...?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
You -- Listen: you said to me, `if not now, when...'
Admittance form is wrong.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Yeah.
You use their witness.
That's right.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Read me what she said.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked.
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do ...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know. I went ...
... You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Yes.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Hi. How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four. You're great with these kids.
You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Thanks, Franky.
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop... ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh. And why is that?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Should I?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
No, I'm all right.
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
Someone dead.
It's not my line.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
She... went into the Bay.
Did she hurt herself?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
You.
Why?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Let me come in.
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Salina, Kansas!
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?!
Please! And don't look at me.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes --
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
Judy --
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
No, you wouldn't let me. And I don't want to go...
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Is that the best you can do?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
All in good time.
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
Why?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
Go up the stairs, Judy. I'll follow.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
We'll find him.
What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
You... ...fell into the Bay.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
At...
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Before? Where? Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Wandering about.
You like it, too.
Oh! Yes! Here!
I... didn't know where you lived.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Wander about.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
What?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Not at all, I enjoyed --
I enjoyed talking to you.
No! No, thank you!
What?
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
The oldest living things?
I don't like them.
Why?
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
No.
No, thank you.
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
When?
Long ago...
Where?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, don't ask me!
Why did you jump?
No!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Home?
...somewhere in the light.
Vaguely...
What do you remember?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
Where?
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
What else?
No.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
No!
I'm so afraid... ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Only this far.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
Yes --
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
It's all there. It's no dream.
No, never!
And it's a all real.
Yes.
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
Too late... there's something I must do...
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine --
Please let me go.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Madeleine!!
Yes.
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
What is her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Would you please go and look?
What car?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please! And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Why?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I'm having one now.
Oh!
I've never run across one like that.
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Could be.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
My... the acrophobia.
How?
That!?!
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Okay.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
And she died...
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I'll take you home.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Out!
Think? Well, what do you think?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Where?
Around.
Oh?
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
Wandering.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Oh?
By whom?
How?
By her own hand. There are many such stories.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
But you said grey, sir.
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I thought so!
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Excellent.
I need a drink.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Sorry Fish.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
I don't have to...
She's dead.
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
Why?!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
You're a loser.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
You go home!
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Why?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
Sure, why not.
So I didn't fucking do it!
What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
Adam! Calm down.
I got children. I've got a life.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.
There is no candy!
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
I know you'll be. Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. I think it's fucked.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
What does that mean?
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow. We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Fish?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Left side.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
I can't.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Nobody knows.
Good God...Good God...
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Suck my ass.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Isn't it a little late?
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
New king.
Then what do they have?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
You said nobody would miss her.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
You will not screw this up.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip. What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
What?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
I think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
Well it's bad timing.
How do you figure?
Right before the wedding?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What are you talking about?
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You expect more what?
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
Problems?
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Maybe.
I will.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I love you.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Hi.
Not yet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Now?
Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
Okay. Okay.
No.
Yes.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
But...
What money?
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Move the bodies?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
No...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
But...
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
About what?
You're not breathing right?
He's your brother.
So?
Go for it.
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Have another drink.
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
What?
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
A move?
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
All week long.
Where?
That's what I'm thinking.
Yup.
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Okay boys, smile!
We will.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man. Desert.
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
You'd like me to kill them?
Yes, yes.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
It's a present from my parents.
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
That one.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
No.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Come down.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Don't you ever see him?
Never.
How could anybody behave like that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Evil.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Whatever you like.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Don't go!
Go away! Leave me alone.
You must listen to me before you go.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Then you won't forgive me?
Yes, sir. Good night.
What's the matter?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
She won't even know.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Yes.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
Good.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
That's good land.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
He was asking for it.
But why? Why?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
What are you going to do?
You're happy, aren't you!
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time. I'm not like him, am I?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Why?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Well... is it so urgent?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Leave him alone.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
What's he called?
Canelo!
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Things seem to be getting better.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Where?
Come with me.
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
But, miss ...
Yes!
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.
Good, then let's go!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
From the terrace.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
No, I don't want to.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Me? What did I do?
Why wasn't I told?
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Whatever.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
I wish we could hear them.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
I've seen worse.
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Then I guess we're even.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
You think he's smart?
I think we both know who did. What's so urgent?
I need your help--
I don't set policy. You have the key?
Got it.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Not from in here.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
You're...such a wimp.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It feels so.. .real.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
All my work is my finest.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
Of course you are.
Glad to...
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm still working on it.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
And I'm going to make sure of it. Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
Thank-you. Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What does that mean?
Stop me.
This is my area of expertise.
Nothing.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
That's why I'm asking.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Why's that?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
What are you talking about?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him.
What are you saying...
When you... What? I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>. What?
For Schumann.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true. It's true, right?
No, this is great.
Okay. Okay. The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.

Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
...and...
And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Look, look, look.... He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
He's not fine.
Come on.
...where?
Come on.
Shot down, Forced down... You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
...how do we explain that? With the World Watching.
What rig?
...the Harvester...
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>. He's <u>dead</u>. The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Okay. And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now: why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
One day, Two days? <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?

It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
....we landing?
Tell me again.
What's it gonna cost?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who would find out?
...the...
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
<u>Shifty</u>. Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Why?
What do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.

I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.

What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
...that's right.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
...<u>isn't</u> it? Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do? I'm gonna "Fade Away." What are you gonna do?
Might, if I was asked...
Of what?
The Albanian Campaign.
...the Albanian Campaign. This... this is history...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that. For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...

Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Speaking of that... We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num... the number...hello...hello...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff? Hello...?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
How's our friend?
Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
We're going home. We're going home together...
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
...but...

They'll be here in ten minutes.

Naw, naw, we own the airways...
No. You're right.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...

Watch me.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Watch me.
Stanley. Stanley... you knew the... Stanley. You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
Take ten.
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
What guards Us Against Canada...?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back? Schumann.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
They look stupid.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Leopard Skin...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Thank God this is America.

And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
The hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
"...the special detachment..." Good! What is it?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks.... I think we're up-and-running...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten. Um... <u>Later</u>.

Sell it all. What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Please, no thanks...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...if I had your looks, better.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Marv, ...I just bagged the elephant!
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Hey the door was open.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Start unloading.
Sell?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
About what?
The FAA announcement.
Alright. Why so pissed?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Whatever night you like.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
I met them before you were born.
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
We are?
So you're hot on this stock?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
What was that?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Okay.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Yeah, right...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
He never told me...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Jackson, Steinem...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
...I can't even see it...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
What? How do you know about my father?
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
How much?
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Are you with me Buddy?
Dump it.
Gordon.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant.
Break it.
You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
Yeah, almost...
And what do you want?
I don't.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Why?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
It's over you, Gordon.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
With Mark?
He still likes you
Businessman!
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Yeah
So why are you dating Jonathan?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
What's that?
A body. I mean we're talking major body
It's eleven forty-five let's go
About what? About us.
Us is over. You had your chance you blew it.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Suffer? We're living in America.
China. What happened? CHINA Shhh. It's ok. I missed you so much.
Hi
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Thank you
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Have a nice day sir
Jenkins!
Good evening sir.
Too late for that sir. Give my love to the misses. Get those bastards!
Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?
No Jonathan.
No?
She went to a waxwork party
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you. It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
They seemed, closing by much
Tony and China?
Vell. Goodnight.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
What? Tony and China, together?
Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I'm not kidding. I want to get out of here - now, ok.
I don't know. I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
A little?
You don't understand. I recognized his face now come on.
Big deal!
Who's is all this?
Well. .this, is Mr. Lincoln. And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
China
Go away.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right.
Right behind you.
Hi there Sarah
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share. I love them
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
Sell my soul?
Maybe before the event, never after.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
Servants. Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really? We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
I'll think about it. Now run along darling.
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
You guys are being real assholes
Never fear, Tony is here. Ladies first.
Hey.
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Why?
No, he wouldn't.
Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
I know he does.
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
No. But once I heard...
What?
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
Then we both are.
Mine. His. We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
No.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.
What does she look like?
Pretty. She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Nope.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Do you?
No.
What do you think? Guess.
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
You were in an accident?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
I am.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Just fine. It's a lovely party.
Almost.
Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned.
At the party.
Toward the end. You remember?
Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.
The wives.
Um...
I'm running late here. I just came back for my briefcase.
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
Give me that shit. Your wife.
I didn't kill my wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I've seen you. From the window.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
Who? Your husband?
And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
I've never even met you.
I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you...
You do?
Right. I'm sorry.
Very much.
Thank you.
And these roses. They're much prettier up close.
Of what? What were you so afraid of?
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
No. No, I don't.
Yeah.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
Claire.
She never mentioned you.
It's fine.
I'm not. We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.
This is...
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Good. I'm good.
You are?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Well good. So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different?
Yep.
It's niiice.
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Please. That's all I need.
What?
In the window. Norman's at work.
I don't...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
The planchette?
This.
Shhh.
M-E...
It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.
Jody, wait.
I think so
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
It's alright.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
Then what was it?
Did I?
And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Please.
I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you.
I was down in Adamant...
Adamant?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
No.
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What is it?
Did he say that?
Jody he was lying.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I think three...
Three weeks.
Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.
We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's Saturday.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
How is it?
Nice. Almost done.
No, no. I'm just about... There.
Fine.
It's okay if you're not.
I am, really.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Not the focus.
You know what I mean.
You are...
We did.
I know.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Shhh.
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
I'm finished at three. No. Squash with Stan.
After that.
I'll be there.
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I'm telling you. There was something in her voice...
Remember how we were?
To make sure she's all right.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
Claire...
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
It's what I've been working for.
Mmnph.
Hurry...
Is it gone?
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no. It's fine.
Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.
There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house. I was scared.
Did you call the police?
No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.
Of course.
What kind of whispering?
I don't know. Just...whispering.
I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Really?
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You know what that does to me.
You're kidding.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What? No. No.
You didn't?
Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Huh.
What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.
What?
No. Look! In the window.
A flare?
From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass.
She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know.
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did? Mrs. Feur?
Maybe. Point is...not me.
Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.
When?
...since Caitlin. You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Yes, tonight. We're going to be--
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Restaurant. Let them know we're running late.
Five minutes?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We're going to be fine.
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
No! And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and--
This is the Feur thing?
Yes. And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
What are you...? No.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
The accident...?
But then you've been so much better...
I will NOT.
Claire, please...
Then where is she?
No, it's fine. I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Yep.
Call ya later.
Are you glad? I'm glad.
Good. You sat in front...I saw you there...
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
I...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio. I took you home.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
Not personally.
No. I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's her. This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
Yes. The ghost.
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
What?
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
DON'T touch me. Just get away from me. Go!
To Caitlin!!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Stop...
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?
It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's gone.
What?
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
Yep. There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.
What?
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine. I'll do the shopping.
Okay. Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
:Well, they are.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence.
But you've not told Michael.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor.
Two what...?
Two heartbeats.
But why would they do that...?
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael. At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Michael, Rowan should -
"Go back, Michael. Do what you can..."
Then tell me. Is it Lasher....
What are you talk---
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm. Seems & lot longer.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It's over a month. The police say it happens all the time.
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair. Who's calling...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
This is your aunt. Carlotta Mayfair. In New Orleans.
I under5tand. All the same
Who the hel1 -
Out of the question Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I want to see my mother. Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear. where else...?
There are things I have to know!
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
The lamplight. That's all.
Better than most, I suppose.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
She didn't feel them
You're a monster.
'He'...?
It wes a dream...!
Witches. Rowan. that is what we are.
ENOUGH!!!
The door, Michael. find the key...
Help us. Do what you can.
Michael... Help us... The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
FAST.
uh - then he - be just -
He just went out like & light-
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Lie...?
There are things you will not tell him.
Like this...?
Nooo... NO! Stop!
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
You bastard...
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away! I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
It's too soon to know.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!!
Then help me--- for his sake...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Only you...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Leave me alone!
Wrong...? Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
You went into the cells --- and you changed them. How...?!
There was no thought. There was no act. That is not what I am.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for me now. Michael is gone!
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this... LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan. Always...
My jury's still out on that,
Nothing. Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...? LIKE THIS...?!
Yessssss...
What're you - a mindreader...? Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...? Your family there...?
Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He fools around with his patients too.
Okay. y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
You don't know what you meant - because you don't know me.
Michael - this place is increadible. You - you're brilliant... The things you created...
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Mad. for each other.
Michael! Jesus I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What's wrong..?
Goodbye, Michael. I love you.
I know. It's not possible --- but I know.
- a witch.
Yes. I love you. Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Let's see.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hello..
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
Michael!
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
- we made a fire.
Your beneficence.
A little sore. Darm... Finish up my section, will ya...?
Lock the door. Lock it
I don't know.
A bit much. Lucas.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. Grayson.
Where are you gitting these...? Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Go ahead.
Hi. You - you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see a movie...?
I - I... I can't, Michael. There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Gotcha.
That's not good enough. Why not...?!
I can't leave now. Don't ask me to explain! I just can't!
Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Stop it!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You bastard!
No.
It's alright...it's airight. He's gone, Michael... Gone.
You can't just -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
If you like that type.
Just nervous. Getting married, you know. Got the rings...?
Left behind...? This about Rowan...?
Yes. Partly. It's - it's - Stu - do you believe in ---
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley. Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves.
I like him. He can stay.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Papers...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I heard something like that
I'm sorry - I didn't think
A person could get killed round here just for working late
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
All the time?
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
The touch?
I'm sorry?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I think I will pass...
Yes, one and a half please.
I'm a dentist
And how long have you been a dentist?
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
You don't know?
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Why not? Please - it would help me
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Did you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Then make it stop...
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
No thanks -
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
You killed my friend!
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
At 2.00...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What?
You heard me - keep away from him
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your landlady
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
No - a dentist
No worries
Don't worry about it -
Oh...
Yes...?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
You and your pep talks.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
I defy any and all limits.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin! Aw, who are we kidding...
Astronomical.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Not ever. Never.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, whatever.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
And some really fast cars.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Take a whiff of heaven.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh, god. Look. Look.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
These are real, live women?
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
You go first.
Ladies first. I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
But that smile.
Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So you'll think about it?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Yeah? You like?
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Christy? You want to be in "Heaven?"
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
You know...take the pictures?
That was code for "I like you."
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
You have changed since second grade.
I mean, what do you think?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We love our lives just the way they are.
We miss our family.
Dad, please.
Of course we are.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Well, why should I?
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
...not the pit.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Want a lesson?
Got it.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I know. I'm Ginger. Miss April.
The one with the horses.
That's me.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry. He found the chocolate room.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hmmm?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Whatever you want.
Of course we were.
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
I'm Helen McDole. Your father's executive secretary.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My new bike.
Very funny.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
My room?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
It's not up to me.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I have absolutely no intention--
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Your article sucked.
In what sense?
Me?
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
Not "whatever." It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
I doubt it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
But you never do.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Let's do it.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Amen to that.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Wearing them? Or humping them?
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Come on.
Maybe someday.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Yellow pages?
Let your fingers do the walking.
You better.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
But how would we pay our bills?
You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like what?
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I'm warning you.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I have only one concern...
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.
You're sure?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Tipping?
Yeah. Everything's cool.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I do?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing... I've never even actually...
Why, look who's here.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire. You own it now. Any questions?
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
I'd like that.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...
What about the blood?
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child...
And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's niece.
I'm fine. Nice TV.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
I understand.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Suzie Toller is missing.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
The skinny brunette.
Lombardo's settlement?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
I net a guy in a bar.
You could say that.
Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.
So you were alone.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.
What was that?
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
And what do they say?
Suzie Toller's. And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
I wanna go home now.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie! Did this man rape you?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
I said he did.
Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
I'm sorry?
No!
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
What?
A ride. You want one?
Yeah. But I got my bike.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
What brain?
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Shit.
Curiosity, I guess.
About what? How to improve your breast stroke?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You're out of your mind.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam! Hi!
Whichever one I want.
You notice my new jumper?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.
Yes. God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I won't.
In back of the garage.
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
Yes.
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
Duquette. Forget him...
I don't know. I want to see you...
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you. Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You think that's wise?
Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Forget it.
Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying.
Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Fair enough. Let's go make a statement.
Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro.
That's right.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.
You can't...
I did. At Blue Balls.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's cop bullshit.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.
That's right. That was his name.
The one you bought at school.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
That's right.
Sit down, Lombardo.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Put Kelly on too.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
Hi, Sandy.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Can't. Got a passenger.
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Funny. So am I.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Always hoping. Or this...
No offense, but all I ever need... Are these... And this.
Try what?
I'll work on it.
Aha?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.
Is this leading somewhere?
Prepare what?
My disguise. And here...
Quite. Come, let's mingle.
Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Almost?
Yes. Now, observe....
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
What way is that?
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Well... that, too.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
Thank you.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless.
Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder. My own design.
Shhh! Come on. Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
It is?
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
Yes. And a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota... Willard, New Mexico?
Relax. We're almost there.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left!
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
I adjusted it.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.
What? President Grant is...!
I know! I know!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
There's only seventy-eight.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
I'm sure we will.
You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Like hell! I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
My... the wild west.
Your guests, ma'am?
You most certainly do.
You tell me.
Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
You bring the best out in a man.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
I would, Mr. Doyle! Are you game?
Yes sir.
That'll be all, boys.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And now the job's yours.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers?
He had a pressing engagement.
Philistine.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Yes!
Who were they? What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
In an hour they're gone!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Right.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
They're not after me. They want the baby.
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
What is Tir Asleen?
You are very important, Willow.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest. But I can give you these...
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Not today, Willow.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow...
No. I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Why not?
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
He turned that monster into stone!
I will! But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good. How long will it take?
Why.
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Peck! Quick! Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns. My arms. Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I hate this.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
Where the hell did you come from?
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Nursemaid?!
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
I did?
My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help.
Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.
I won't.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
Willow!
Well what did she say?
You're crazy. I think you're in love.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her. How's she doing?
She's a bird, Willow.
Ahhh!
I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle...
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini...
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
No!
Kill him!
No.
A magician *makes* magic. Any fool can use it.
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
What do I need for that?
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Patience. Concentrate. You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
The art of transformation!
Me!
That's the life spark. Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Shhhhh!
We need blood. To nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
Now use it.
No! Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Use the philosopher's stone! Hur- ry! Invocation! Release them!
Why?
Just do it!
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
Somebody has to do it.
He never misses.
Me neither!
Yes! Raziel! She lives out on that island!
Us?? We'll never catch them. Any- way, we're all done, Teemo. Let's go home.
Ouch! Let go of me!
Shut up.
I changed her already!
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Who??
You're the guardian, aren't you?
No! You let us handle this. Come along, Rool!
Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
Why not?
Hurry! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How are we going to get out there?
The sorceress.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
Just do it!
I thought I was the English.
Try the house.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
I won't. Now run. Fast as you can!
Sure have, Sam.
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
What have you got?
Maybe.
You know who?
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Move! Or you die right here!
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
It's not a joke.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
No.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Home.
You couldn't wait until morning?
I was wrong.
I can't.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
No, no doctor...
But why?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
But 
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
How long have I been here?
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that?
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Anything against zippers?
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
Oh. The bullets.
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
Aren't you? After today?
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Where's my baggy pants?
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway?
Say again?
Make that 1790.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
Probably.
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But... if you had to guess?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
You didn't have to...
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No? Why not?
His name is John Book.
No...
Looks dead...
I know.
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Lean on him.
All right, where is he?
You might have killed him!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh -- all right.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Yes, darling.
No --
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
To see?
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
You'll be hist...
Do you presume to criticize the....
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Oh ....
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Oh --
Goodbye, folks!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Hickory!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
Catch him, you fool!
Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
What's she doing now?
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
But you couldn't have been, could you?
No --
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Stop her!
Did you say something?
Oil can....
My mouth -- my mouth!
...Oh, did that hurt?
No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
All hollow. Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh --
What sort of an animal is that?
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh! Oh, Tin Man! Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly --
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
No, but you tried to.
Oh.
The nerve.
Yes.
Look! He's rusted again. Oh, give me the oil can -- quick! Oh-oh, quick!
Hah!
It's the Witch! She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King! If....
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Huh? What'd he say?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh --
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
My, it's good to be....
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. Hmm!
Oh --
What?
Yes. Oh -- look --
Oil can? Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, no -- please. I have to rest for just a minute. Toto!
Oh --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Don't you start it, too!
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
I don't know.
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here -- Come on.
What was that?
Don't stand there talking! Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine. He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
This way! Come on!
Yeah!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Oh, scared, huh?
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Whozat?
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Yeah --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Not nohow!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
NO!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Oh -- now look at him! This is terrible!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you! Help!
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
You know something?
It's a whozis?
Oh! Well, what happened to you?
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, no!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yeah --
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Yes.
Well, I --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Yes -- ....
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Oh! Help me! The balloon's going up!
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Dont know any doctor jokes.
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
Bond --
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Alright then, brunch.
Then its no longer a bomb?
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
Elektra King.
Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty. Ill be there.
We cant.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
James. It wouldnt really be...
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
I could come for a second opinion?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I took the initiative.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
Renard.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
I cant tell you... Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Indeed.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.
Havent you heard the news? So is she.
Yes.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
You knew him well?
Im sorry.
Yes.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
Partially, yes.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
No.
Were alright.
Youre not going to.
Its the only way out...
I know.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
...you should rest.
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
...what?
You can drop the act, its over.
I dont know what youre talking about!
I think you do.
Not interested.
Soon shell be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
It is my oil! Mine and my familys!
Elektra, its not too late. Eight million people neednt die.
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Shes no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
You are out of your league. Shes working with Renard.
A rope!
And the payoff on the tables?
A special job. A...a...a submarine.
No! Get me out!
This is too big for even you. Where is it?
Where?
Istanbul.
How appropriate.
Bond!
C-class.
Could...could you come?
Please.
Who? Bond? Bond is dead.
Is it?
How would you know?
Of course...
What do you think?
No. It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Yes. Au revoir...
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Marvellous.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why? What's the problem?
I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent.
I would like to use the bathroom --
What?!
Please.
You oughta see upstairs. It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
They want in. Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Don't call me that.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Wrong answers?
Who is she? Do you know her?
Why, doctor. I did. He was a bad dog.
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague. The Comedian is dead.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.
Jon! Get back! You don't understand.
Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Collect me?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yes, I loved you. I left the earth when I lost you.
Because --
You're the only human being I care for.
You have the power to do it. I want you to do it. Please.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
The south pole. Times flowing backwards.
Veidts complex.
Space and time. I finally understand, Laurie. I see it all now.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
I see what the watchmaker made. I see the universe!
My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
Good night.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.
I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
Im not.
What if youre wrong??
Damn straight! We were heroes.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever. Okay?
Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I'm thirty-eight years old!
Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
Pick a record. I feel like dancing.
I know what you're thinking. You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I'm an open target, Dan. If you're with me --
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Memory lane.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
What are you up to?
Don't look. Turn around.
Okay!
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Oh, Laurie. Jesus. No.
All right. Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out. Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .
That Detroit shit? I'm so worried.
The costumes. Am I right?
Yes you are.
I think he's going to the john.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now? Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Where did he go?
Those cars. What year is this??
Everything's changed --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left. Backs together --
We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
Human bean juice. The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago. I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Toilet clogged. Short fat turd. Let's get out of here.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU. Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
I don't think she's coming with us.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Don't know. Nothing I can think of -- -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one. He's been the one all along. Stalking us.
Adrian -- you? You killed Blake, and --
Adrian. Its too late. The world is blowing up as we stand here.
We should get back -- What?
Nothing. What were you going to say?
We should get back to the lab. You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
-- What?
My dad's a watchmaker. I'll put it back together for you. Better than ever.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No. We laid out very careful ground rules --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not. Now get out of my way!
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
What does this mean? What does it --
Am I free to go?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please. Let's move it.
Laurie! Good to see you.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator. -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. I'll ring for the guards.
I'm sorry about Blake.
You're making a big --
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!! -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence. Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
CTU? Jesus. You don't think --
Don't know. Ask around. I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone. Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.
What is that ungodly smell?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
Why is that?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What weapons do you have?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Like what?
He gets to be the hero.
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
That right? Why's that?
We hung out last night, remember?
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
I'm from L.A.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
What are you talking about?
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't you afraid?
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let's do this.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Viktor! Stay the course.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I can see that. Why?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
This is a gift. From me to you.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
We all do.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember. Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or your... X-Men.
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars. Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
What do you say?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You mutant bastards...
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
To find Rogue.
How?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.
I'll go.
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
How?
It was Xavier's people. They knew.
A piece. Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
I know.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Oh, shit.
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
... No!
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes, sir.
Baack!
What?
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
Is it that music?
MMMMM! MMMMM!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Surprised!
Love me?
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not. I just meant...
All right then!
Of course I am. Now come along like a good boy.
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
It seems fine.
Yes!... the laboratory.
No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Will there be anything else?
I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Good.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
A week. Ten days at most.
What?
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes?
Vermicelli.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen, sir.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
I am a scientist...! not a philosopher.
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
How do you do?
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf! There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
What are you doing here?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Must be the music room.
'How I Did It.' Good title!
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
That's not bad.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
Why?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like -- just hurry!
Thank you, Master.
All right... elevate me!
Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You've got it, master.
This guy means business.
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
Wait till he sees the bill.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
But you did -- I just heard it.
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Don't fall for that one.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
Yes.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Why?
... I'm glad that's...
No, no! That whole thing!
... Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Can you play it?
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
What???
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
There's only one way.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's the only way.
Okay, boss! But I hope you know what you're doing.
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!
Yes, I'm going to set you free. Is the sedative ready?
MMmmm! MMmmm!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
Oh, just a little.
Ja, ja.
How nice.
Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
That's quite all right. What is it, dear?
No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga, wake up!
What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen! Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes! What could it be at this hour?
I don't know. It just woke me up.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there. I'm going down to see.
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh! Yes, Doctor.
I thought it was wonderful.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I think you've done it, master.
Alive! Look at it. I have defeated death!
What do you think we should do?
I think I'll...carry him.
Me? Sing?
Yes -- quickly, dear!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Stop -- singing!!!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Oh! Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Good! It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night!
Wonderful? It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely.
Not fooling around.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Nor to Elizabeth.
No. Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Well... ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Yes, I will.
MMmmm.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you. So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
His schwanzstucker.
Whew! A nineteen-inch drill.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Why don't we all turn in? It's been a long day.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly. Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Four
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid! I just hope this all ends well.
Igor -- the clock! Hurry!
Do Something! Stall them!
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
Oh, no sir-ee. If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Franz! Help! Lunatic!
