Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You have my word. As a gentleman
Sure have.
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I was?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Great
Is he oily or dry?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Queen Harry?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God. It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom? Kat has a date?
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
I thought you hated those people.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
I didn't have a choice.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Tempestuous?
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
Touch of the flu.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Your life, and that of others!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
I know.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
I'm not bargaining!
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
You come! You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
All of them! Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I am listening, my son.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
What do you read?
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here. Shit...
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.
No. No way.
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused. Don't you think?
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Oh.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
But Chief? Over this??
Yeah, right.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
Are you hit?
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
You know what that is, right?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Two heads.
You thirsty?
I'm on duty.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Why not?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
So...who's Nicky?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
You're ruthless.
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
Answer the phone.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Okay.
See you later. Good luck.
Thank you.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
That's unique.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
I am butcher.
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where is escort service?
Give me the address!!
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
Yes.
Please join us. Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
This all you want?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
You got that?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Did you hurt her?
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
Yeah?
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright. Go ahead.
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
No. Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way! He's mine!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah? What kind?
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
He knew all along.
What??
Yeah?
How long they been livin' here?
Aren't you tired?
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Your doctor?
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
It's possible.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Hal?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
That's right.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Yeah?
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy. Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here you go, baby.
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Yeah.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
Where's the money?
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
What about Luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
It's late, they're closing...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
You okay?
It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah...
Jack?
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
You look awful.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
I'm all wet.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
You real down?
How do you know?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey...
Shut up.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
Give it back.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.

You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
So you do know her.
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
What are you doing?
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Is there anything that can stop it?
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I was talking to the cat.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
So, just how big was this fare?
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
He's on vacation.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
What mission?
To save the world.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Apipoulai!
Love...
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
Where you going?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The cash man!
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
It's not?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Got it.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure. I'll call the guy.
This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
Hello?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
Tom...
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know. I'm sorry...
You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
You should have.
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
Bullshit.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
Machine.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Where are the women?
What are these for?
Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why?
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
Easy enough for you.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
They're no friends of mine.
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're asking me why?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
Not quite.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
Snuff films.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Wha... ?
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
You don't need to be here.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
He's odd.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
Okay...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're joking.
Hello... ?
I'm here.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you? Having any luck?
I hope it's nothing serious.
How will I get it to you?
Yes... ?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
No.
What was she running from?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
I had to ask. I apologize.
People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
There wasn't one. The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
How... how can you say that to me...?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Yes... I remember Mary
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
What?
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't go back to sleep again.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
What's wrong with me?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I'll tell you later.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
Feeling better now?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus! Don't do that!
Okay, babe. What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
You're right.
There you go. Love you.
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Alice!
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
You do good work, Alice.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
Where are you going?
They think I'm nuts.
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life. Oh, what's that?
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
These things are wild... What do you think?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
It's okay.
You, too?
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
What is it?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not - ?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
Reef!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Huh?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
I think you're right.
Yeah?
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Course and speed?
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
Now they feel it...down below.
Under <u>water</u>?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
All ready?
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Swell!
He did!
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Well, I'll be - !
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Twombley involved?
What are you boys up to?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
No.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
How about a Big Mac?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Fuck you.
What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Lillian!
Yeah.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
No problem. Look, I...
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
Forget it.
You don't mean that.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
This is nuts.
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
What the hell are you talking about?
Hold on!
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
It don't look right.
What?
You talked to Jack?
Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Where's Ma?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
Rolfe.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Yes dear?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
Did we warn them off?
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
I prefered the terrorists.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by... Tower?
A dubious distinction, no?
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Twenty minutes?
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
How did your speech go?
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What?
That's right, Commissioner. Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Forget it. I was reading.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Sir?
Elaine.
Te...!
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted! What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
Set!
Now!
Ted, the lever!
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Simon.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Can't we change course?
Maybe.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive. Look, Elaine, I...
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
All right. Here.
You're sure?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No. I mean your relationship.
Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Both pilots!
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Elaine!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Good-bye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's right on the heading.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here. Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
William Harcourt?
Yes...
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
Here?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest. Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Aw-right. What about the other guy?
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
Which one is that? Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
And what was that one about my mother? That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
Was. Divorced.
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
What was that about?
... It is called ss'jabroka'. To us it is a potent narcotic.
We? You've taken it?
We all did.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Uh, George...
Shit!
What's this about, George? I know that look.
No! We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
We can't let him get away.
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
What is it?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah, I heard of it.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Yeah, Sykes?
Departmental policy.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
I can't! Do you mind!
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
Movement!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.
Yes. That follows.
That's it. See it? Emergency venting.
I'll go.
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Ripley...
You did okay, Bishop.
Have they located my daughter yet?
I get the picture.
No. There's no way!
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
Where are your parents? You have to try...
What is it?
I don't know.
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Are there any questions? Hudson?
...We're coming in.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We got problems.
The corner! Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go! Let's go!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
They'll get us.
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
It's game time.
Locked.
No! No! She's alive! We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
Range twenty meters.
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters.
Nine meters. Eight.
Can't be. That's inside the room!
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Terrible.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
Casey. She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would.
They're dead.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
Newt. Newt, wake up.
Wah...? Where are...?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Burke! Open the door!
Come on. Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
This way. Come on, we're almost there!
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Don't bother!
What?
Don't bother.
Oh - excuse me!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
Sir -
You have leave to try.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
What is it?
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
No! No! No!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
No!
Yes!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Why not? Half the house!
Who was that?
No one.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Why not?
Excellency!
How charming. But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Originals?
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
But! I'm a married woman!
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Money! Money!
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Yes?
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Majesty!
Why so?
Yes, where?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What? On one hearing only?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Yes?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Sssh!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
German!
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Well, we can.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Really?
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Do you mean that?
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Where did I stop?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
The Fire.
What time?
I think so.
Yes.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Do you have me?
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
About what?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Well?
Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
Did you try?
You cannot say that!
My son, no one can speak for God.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Here I am, my angel.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes, sir.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
He's here.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Yes, Doctor.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
David?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you come with me?
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
But...
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Jack is dead!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
David, don't lose control.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
He all right?
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Now see here young man.
Who is this girl?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
There were witnesses?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
You've never had bad dreams before?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What the hell was that all about?
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Walk away, Jack.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm going completely crazy.
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Excuse me. Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
Do you have any hot soup?
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes - sure
No kidding?
Where's Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
I remember once when your account checked.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
We want to talk to you.
What about?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
You understand?
Thanks.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
Fifty thousand dollars!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
know, but
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Me?
Well, you can. You always could.
What is?
running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Line?
Doesn't that come next?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
What?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What's this?
My apartment.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
The theatre?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Why - well, I
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Helen!
Yes?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Well, I
I already told him I was home.
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
What time did this thing happen?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Well . . . ?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Dude Finlay?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
Huh?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Everybody in?
I guess so.
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Here's Liberty's favorite son! I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
We got a problem here, brother?
This is the best score yet.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
How'd they --
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
He's not bad at it.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Oh no...
Damn!
The Army can hang him.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Hey!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
She was European!
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
Perfect, Cole.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
I got seven thousand.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare. He's European.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Strategically.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of course! Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered. From back there.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
Boys...
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
You know him?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Bob's upset.
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
We're doing this for Ma.
We're drunk.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Uncle Frank?
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Easterners.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
Where will you find such a girl?
Sparkling rocks?
Little ones.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
What?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
You almost ended my career before it began.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Last February?
Yes?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
And you're too young.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I like that.
You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
... too young for whisky...
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
They had to be dealt with!
There's only four of them...
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
THEN WHO DID?!
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
That.
This is him.
How did you know?
This is no game.
So you can't tell me anything?
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Can't you tell me anything?
So he's won.
In English, Pinkerton.
What is that?
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
I never knew you smoked.
Isn't that special? Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
No, no, no.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God...
What?
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Late?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
What is it?
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
Jean? What?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Next Saturday?
She's my...cousin.
Uh huh?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
No.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable. Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides... the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Oh.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Have you consulted a psychic?
No.
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see... That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
And?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting. Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Hey, Halberstam?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Is it over?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
"Make" him?
I'm just screwed.
You don't wanna move, do you?
It's important.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
He's your boss. He's not your --
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
I can't just walk away!
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Whaddo I do?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
Nothing.
...Why?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Look at this.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Great!
You look beautiful.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He wasn't acting?
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Milo?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What?
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
What?!
...When did you know?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We tried!
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
Who's that?
Cool!
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
The wrong place?
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, I --
This is good. Who did it?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
What'd the girl say?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?
I think you should go.
You do?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Lisa.
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.
They'd frame him.
...Milo?
Who can we trust?
How close are you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean -- break in?
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
That's lame, isn't it?
Meet me at the other location.
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
...You got my E-mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
She's a programmer?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Speaking of which...
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
You may.
Come in.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
We won, Austin.
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Right away, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Yes Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good on ya, man.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
What?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Who?
You know who.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Are you crazy?
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
Noooooooooooooo!
What are you saying, son?
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Commander, I have to log it...
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Ow! You shot me!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
My son?
Quite impressive.
Dr. Evil?
Sea bass.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
Why?
I just don't see it.
Did you ever...
Of course not. I was married to your father.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Well, it's kind of weird.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
No, he's really evil.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
... bottle ...
Red ...
Knight ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
Flower ...
Nature ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
How long have I been here?
Would that I could say the Same.
You
Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You are female?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
I resign.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The Institute ... the funding ...
Who?
To find out who killed my husband.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
'Our revels now are ended.'
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Valentine, listen to me ...
What are my choices?
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's. My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
Really? I fail to see the connection.
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
And I suppose you're the knight.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
June, July ... August?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead. How do you feel?
I wasn't about to.
Did he say who?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
I must say, you look more your old self --
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
But
Not quite. This is my field.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
You followed me.
Orders.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Yes ... ?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
I told Mother I took care of you.
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry? What for? I'm just now --
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You first.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Mrs. Peel?
What kept you?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Have you any place in mind?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
You don't believe him?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch: Valentine Peel.
Peter's brother? But --
Surveillance? By whom?
Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.
Privately owned by ...
Let me guess: Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
How did you guess?
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
Think she really killed those agents?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
Anyone particular in mind?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Guilty until proven innocent?
Where?
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
John Steed.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You are, and it's behind you.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Does Cole know about this?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
You're kidding.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
All right!
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
Seventy-five hundred.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
The car for Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Maybe it had something to do.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Let go of me!
I don't believe you.
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Ilene, Rick promised...
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
That's it, prick lips.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Give him the works.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Let's go.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Yes.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.
You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's on the tenth floor.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Oops!
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
The end.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Oooooo.
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Very.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
You're late again, Rick.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
Wash it to the windows?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- Knock it off!
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Goddamn it Stephen!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
This?
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
You okay?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it.
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Maybe I do. ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? People can change Brian.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I know.
How do you know?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Brian.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.
Arson.
Hey.
How's it going?
I could use a date.
Hi.
Sorry. Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Okay.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
Then why did you quit?
Brian. What's wrong?
I was doing my job.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What is --
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
Then who --
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I need another one, sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Are you still here?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
Glass?
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Read.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
But the right guess on this is arson.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
Your brother was a good man.
Brian?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Nice boat.
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
Who's going to die?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Fireman shit?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
-- You remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
He's out.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Shadow.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Who's this?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
"Don?"
Don't you have any leads at all?
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
How are you doing, man?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Me?
I forgive you.
Large?
Oh, really?
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
What money?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
This psycho can.
How's the case going?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT. BLAK LISTED. BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
YEAH!
Alright. Here we go. Let's go NIGGERS! LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Delacroix.
Yeah, him.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do I do?
What do you do?
Life is beginning to look up. It's all good in da neighborhood.
You might be right.
I'm not smiling.
Naw, not you. It can't be. That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
What's that?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Sloan is all 'dat. I try her. I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
Please, have a seat.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away. We both can.
Good morning, Cheeba.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
How much?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
I would like to change your name.
To what?
Why?
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I'm always gonna be that. But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Four minutes ago.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
The name of the show?
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He has educated feet.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Son. Good to seeya. Good to seeya.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman. I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often. He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
How was it?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good. I'm going to need your support.
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
Your life will never be the same.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
What would their reaction be? I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
A gift.
For what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
This is crazy.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw. I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous? Relaxed?
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing. It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke. Serious.
No.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yeah.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.
Peerless, your father called.
He wants you to come and see him.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan. Thanks for coming in.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
No, not that. How 'bout...
She hates dem.
Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big. The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I thought you got rid of...
I heard ya lady is wild.
No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
What else?
This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on.
Y'know what?
What?
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Aw, c'mon.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Good day to you, young sir.
Good morning.
Where are you bound for?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Ah -- I see. No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?
Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I don't know.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious! What is this?
Ten thousand? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Have no fear. It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Very well! Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant. Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
How so?
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill? Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Can I at least have a drink?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, if you've slept.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Bill Styles...
Who?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
I don't want to go --
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Yeah, right...
Why not?
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
We're not finished yet --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
And the bodies?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Where?
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Cadet, what's your name!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Sir, yes, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up. Let me see your grenades.
Why?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
I... I don't know...
What don't you know?
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
He admitted it.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
How do you know?
I didn't --
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Who killed Pike?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Nevertheless --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
That's horseshit and you know it.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're drunk --
Stay where you are.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Ah, Christ
You knew Sergeant West?
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
Good cop/bad cop?
Baseball?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Something like that. You?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him -- Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Watch me.
I didn't shoot West...
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to break him.
Yeah.
So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
For what?
No.
Four --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, what are you doing --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What if I don't want it?
That's not true.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
West?
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
I should probably write that down.
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
Pike, please --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He said what?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Pike never confessed.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Wait --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
What happened with Nunez?
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
The fuck are you talking about --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
You think he did it?
What do you think?
We know.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Didn't kill anything, did I?
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Thank you.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
Yes.
You were expecting me?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
I have to leave. Tonight.
You won't find a better place!
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
I brought it.
Bloom!
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Will.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
Can I see him?
How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Yeah.
How old are you?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Lucky girl.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
No, I understand.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Stop.
Spooning the sherbet.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
I like your stories.
What's your name, Giant?
Okay.
What did she say?
You're not trying to run away?
Jesus Christ.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
The one about the witch.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You -- -- are in for a surprise.
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad?
Son?
Dad!
What?
You think I'm fake.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Like this.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
You say...
It's unbelievable.
Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.
You don't even know me.
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
'Fraid so.
Oh. Oh.
Hello.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
It's bad.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm.
Mmm, what?
Do you love your father?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
But it's not true.
You're not.
I need you on my side.
What happened?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
We rented a car.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Of course.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Mom?
So you never bought any land.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You first.
What for?
You know what for.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yeah it was okay.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
What's this?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Sorry. You've lost me...
I'm asking what you're here for.
What did he say?
I need to know who you are first please.
Oh. We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good.
Hold on.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
No.
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Binoculars.
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Oh Jesus.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Yes.
I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
No I don't.
In the world.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What? No you're not..
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Have you got your passport?
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
He will come back.
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
So now you hate all women?
What?
You...
I got what I paid for.
It wasn't what I wanted.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Thank Christ for that.
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
I'm sorry.
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
What was her name?
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
Is the flight full?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.
Thanks.
How do you want to pay?
What are you doing?
Just wanted to see.
You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Angela?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
This gonna get you in trouble?
This was very sweet of you.
I bet you have loyal customers.
That'd be nice.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Hi.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Can I put it in your mouth?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
You gonna steal my truck?
Jes? Jesse? Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
The fuck you laughin' at?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
You wanna go home?
Better?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
I deserve better than this.
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Let go of my arm...
LAZ, I said let...!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Don't need none.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Let me say somethin' first...
Why you got me chained?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You some kind'a pervert?
No ma'am.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Let go of me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
I don't fuckin' cook.
I can handle that.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You take it straight?
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Still makin' jokes?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Tell me what to do.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Where you gonna be?
Right here. Be here all afternoon. You ready for this?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
By myself?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
Sorry.
Looks like you know a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What I love.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
How a girl get like that?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Or what?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
The hell is this shit?
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
So... That your first time?
Yes'sir.
I skipped lunch.
You a preacher?
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
This ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
Hey.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star.
I feel better. Do you?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
I think she got to you, pappy.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor. And don't call me 'pappy.'
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City. Casinos.
What's this?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Nick, let's go hunting. Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Charlie, don't do anything. Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
Maybe we should do something?
What are you doing?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Let's grab some food.
This should be it...
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible. Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
What'd she say?
You cool, Ich?
Cool?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
What does Charlie mean?
Short shift?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
... We got to keep looking. Track him down! Great balls of fire!
Nick!
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro. Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
What happened?
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
Yeah...
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
What's he saying?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
No. Don't say anything. Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
What'd I tell you?
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay?
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Ichiro --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in. They don't want --
Gaiijin.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I'm not drunk...
We're through. I mean it. This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
... A Godfather. His man was killed at the printing plant.
I want to yank Kobo.
Ich, my name is Nick. Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Where does this Sugai live?
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
What...? Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's very small.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
No...
Let's go. Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
No.
Start it.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
I followed them. An hour from the train station.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you. You have one?
A wife. She left.
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Why's that?
You all right?
Yes...
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Gaiijin?
An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
She ever pull down her shades?
Don't be an ass.
He's on duty.
I need your help, Joyce.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
Who am I supposed to be?
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
No one's keeping him here.
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
Maybe. If I come visit, we can find out.
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce. You're lucky.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
This is my stop.
I'm amused.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
How big a package we talking about?
This by this...
Dope?
One guy do all the damage?
Yeah.
Why?
He's wanted in Japan. They want him first. Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
It's not your job.
He killed a police officer.
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
Because I want you to tell me.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Hey...! HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Your plane leaves at six. Two officers will escort you.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help. Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
I want him.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
You trust me?
If I say no?
You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it.
That wasn't our deal.
You want him dead too.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
You certainly have a nice place here.
He knows what he's doing.
Let's go while there is still time.
Where?
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
One man. He must be good.
Then go get him.
The name is Batty. Roy Batty.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?
Death.
I want more life, fucker.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I've done some questionable things.
Also extraordinary things.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
Show me something?
Like what?
We have a lot in common.
Of course not.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
His company made us.
No.
When do you deliver your project?
You're our best and only friend.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
Just thought I'd...
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I think, therefore I am.
I want to do it.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
I didn't like her.
Look, go home. Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Yeah.
This is Bryant. Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Take a number. Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Yeah. I got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
You equipped for random questions?
Why, yes, of course.
I know all that.
What about a summary then.
Yes?
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years. Which would make her termination date...
Never mind. Do they have that knowledge?
I think I have no money.
It's okay. Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one. What'll you have?
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Don't make me laugh. It makes me pee.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Money?
No. I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
Meaning?
During the road test...
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering. That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Nope.
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
Yes?
I'd like you to take a look at these pictures.
What did she want?
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing. She wanted to know about suck night.
Book the good ones for where?
Lots of places. The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Yeah?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I don't know nothing about it.
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
The best.
Does it eat?
Jeezus!
Sorry.
Me.
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
I'd take him to the doctor.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
Is there anything else?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
You use your equipment, don't you?
So?
Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.
I can imagine.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
Who is this?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Yeah. Sometimes.
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams. I read that.
What?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't leave here. Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What difference will it make?
You know what I think?
What?
Where the hell you been?
What's up?
Bad?
Severed spine. You'd better get in here. Bryant's waiting for you.
Thanks.
Black?
Is this to be an empathy test?
May I ask a personal question?
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
But in your profession that is a risk.
One that relies on human interpretation. Where's the subject?
Well?
If she is, the machine works.
How many questions did it take?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
I'm tired of this.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Don't move.
What?
What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
A tortoise. What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
I don't have one.
Where are your folks?
They left.
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I'm hungry, J.F.
I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
Just better.
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
What's that?
My glands. They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
We work on Rodeo Drive. But we're both professional dancers.
You're kidding!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Please excuse this interruption.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
It certainly is. I agree with you completely.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Are you French?
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Nope.
I'm sorry! I said something wrong, didn't I! Please forgive me!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no! What?!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
It's Webber. Adam Webber.
Wait! Wait!
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
That was...wonderful! I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Wait, Eve, please! Wait.
I knew this would happen! You're like a lost puppy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
No.
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding? In color?
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out? You and...men?
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Wait! Wait!
Well, another day, another dollar. Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life. And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Thank you.
Okay.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
This is for me.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
When do you need her by?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Of course.
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
You almost got us killed!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Here you go. One champagne cocktail.
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?
Where's he gone?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
May I please be excused?
All right.
The what?
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
Yeah.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
No it's not!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
My goodness gracious! This place is something!
No! Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
Quit showing off! We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
I like her.
What have you ordered?
What about her?
No way.
Okay. I like that.
Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
That's ridiculous.
Okay. All right. And what do I say?
What?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
Eve?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Look! I'm limping! How attractive is that?! What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Uh-huh. Adam?
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really? Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Eve!
...All right, Eve. If you say so.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
Is this because of the radiation?
What?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open. Will you be back?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
They're pretty. Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.
You're right! It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Adult Bookstore. Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
You have very nice ceilings.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.
Right on the button.
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Why did you park way back there?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
Does that work?
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
You dial nine to get out.
Of what?
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
My father is a genius.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
What? What is it?!
The sky!!!
The sky? Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
Sorry, Mom!
Dad!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Mom? Eve and I have to go.
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped. We're married.
No.
No! Not the police! Don't call them!
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light!
For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got guests!
Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
It's time.
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No. They all do.
You hear that?!
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Yes, dear!
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin. Babies cry.
I've noticed.
No. I think it's just right.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
Calvin?!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding. Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
Would you excuse me?
In the generator room again?
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
Yes.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean! A mountain range!
He's smart.
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, please excuse us! We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Oh, yes.
Give me your hand.
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
Those sluts!
Where are you going?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
I don't think so.
Oh, no!
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Have him committed.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? I want to go home.
Adam!!
Where?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm selling this place. I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Tower, say again!!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Frank. Come in.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
Yes?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I wanted to see you.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Don't. I don't like that. What do you want?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright.
Don?
No.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.
I made it go down the toilet.
Do you know?
No.
You don't?
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Falling.
Who is Don?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything.
What do you want?
You like to open me, don't you?
Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
Why are you here? HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
MOMMY!
Mommy's here.
Who's this fuck?
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Hello?
No thanks.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
No, you're right.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Where are they?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Are you alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Why not?
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay, thanks.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.
Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Stop it Mike.
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket. Shit!
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What happened?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Anybody see ya?
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
You guys?
We're here brother.
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
What?! What are you doin'?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We... met them last night.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
Be careful.
What are you going to do?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Would someone please come over here and...
Fuck!
me up the...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Hey Murphy?
Aye.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Nervous?
A bit.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
That was way easier than I thought.
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, we're good man.
Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
Yes.
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Rule of thumb?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
Where's my cat?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
You... oh god, why?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
So what are you thinkin' here?
The what man?
And the pennies?
The Greeks. The Italians.
They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.
Who the...
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
How many bodies, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Witness?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Who were the victims?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
What the...?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hello?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Liberating isn't it?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
What the fuck do you mean?
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Hello? You there?
You believe?
Yes.
You feel?
You're right.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Forgive me father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
Open it!
Have you no fear of God?
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Why?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Dignan, calm down.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Holy shit.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
What the fuck is going on here?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
See, now we've got a plan.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
I have an idea for that.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
Our money situation is not good.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
I had to give some to Inez.
How much?
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Who's Mr. Henry?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What time did he say to be here?
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
I don't know.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
Why?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Where?
Does it float?
What's he in for?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Scale the --
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
You mean a safecracker?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
We're renegades from despair.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Future Man.
Who?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Where you going?
You think he got my license plates?
What?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
You think I'm improving?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Give him a second.
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it. Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
Dies y nueve.
Were you born in Mexico?
Cuba.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What? What?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
Are you a fag?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
No.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
So who's going to know?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Bob, will you please listen?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
Come on!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Do they let you --
Hold on --
Here we go.
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I'm working on it.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack. Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
The grammar?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Yes.
Why?
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way?
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't...
We're closed, sir.
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Got a little lucky.
I don't know.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
How's the weather down there?
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
John Mapplethorpe. How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Save it for Bourne.
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
And what are we looking for?
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Do you know what his budget was?
Sorry to wake you.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No. You lost your way.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Lots of people...
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Sit. Can you... [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
They loved you. And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
Because you're afraid!
I have to go now.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
Front. Use your teeth.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Conklin.
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
You called it in?
I'm sorry.
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
Sleep. Sleep now.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.
That's crazy.
No. Not this. This is real. And he's right there...
Where --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
Jesus! -- -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I know it's a dream.
You do?
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Yes.
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
What is this, a game?
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files? WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
What do you mean?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
It's me.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
What's that?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
You're sure?
What? The tapes?
Show me.
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
That's where we came out.
Mr. Nevins?
Who's this?
How long have you worked for the agency?
Amnesia?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
And why is that?
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Let's give him half an hour.
So?
Do we know what this says?
Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
By who?
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
Someone dead from this household?
I don't want to leave.
But... what will you do?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Young Robert, we are honored --
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What news of the north?
Wallace has sacked York!
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
No, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
When will his trial be?
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I'll wait... back there.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Rest, William.
I rest.
You know it's a trap.
That's just a dream, William!
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
You'll move
Good to see you again.
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
We don't split up!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
No. He did not.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
I have faced him. Have you?
Treason. Against whom?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Did it work?
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I've missed you.
Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
Then when?
I'm dreaming.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
It's battle I want, not talk.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Peace is made is such ways.
You will die! It will be awful!
I must... consult with my father.
We can't stop!
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Who would do such a thing?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
What?
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Darn it!
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
There must be a way to fix this.
How. Did you. Know that?
Just. Like. Jason.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Weirder than this?
Dad lives here?
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
I thought you were a December baby.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Huh?
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're... Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
So it didn't feel... weird?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Ha! Where's that?
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
I just thought you should know.
Know what?
There's one major hole in your story.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Where are we going?
Is something the matter?
I was?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
What time is it?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Can... can... Can I have this?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Look what you made me do!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
I come from a big family.
Meant no offense.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I thought I was the bad guy!
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
Here you go, buddy.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
Yes?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Good.
What is your name?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Tonight he forgot.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Hello, Rick.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Practically no one.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Yes, something.
And Mademoiselle?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
We said "no questions."
A franc for your thoughts.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
And I was wondering.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
My German's a little rusty.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
What happened with Rick?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Apparently he has the letters.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
-- Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We'll come again.
Good morning.
Good evening.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Go ahead.
My office.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
Everything in order?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I understand.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
My bill.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
We'll be there.
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
What else, my dear Major?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Ho, diplomatist!
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Mademoiselle.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon. You would like to be on it?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
What, again?
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
This is the end of the chase.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Oh, thanks.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Our expenses?
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Boss!
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yeah, boss?
Uh, my watch stopped.
What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Six kilometers. Four miles.
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Get up.
Feels so good to lie here.
Can't. Need water.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
No more water, you said.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you? Maybe I'm too far south.
You don't know where you are. You missed the shipping lanes.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
You're beautiful. Marry me.
What are you doing?
Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost. Goodbye.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
What are you smiling about? They'll be back.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
It's real.
Nothing out there but ocean.
It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You can't make it.
You came on a bicycle? No wonder it's so late.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed. You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
As much as anybody.
Want to come in? Get dry for a minute.
Hmmm. Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible. So you did those wings?
Yeah. A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh? You've tried?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No. that was the last one.
Keep painting. Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
You? Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
Yeah, a long one.
I've got lots of time.
Sonofabitch!
Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four. A record.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You know, for when you travel.
I have to go. I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
A ring. I wanted a ring.
Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go.
You can't go now.
I have to.
This isn't working out.
We're a little emotional here. It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
That's your dog.
It's our dog. It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away.
No, it was great. Maybe a little overkill --
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Get back? From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
A week, max. Okay? Okay?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
Her name's Hannah.
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
That about sums it up.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
It means a lot...that you came.
I love you, Chuck.
You too.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
And how was your Christmas?
When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish. That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
If you say you are.
I most definitely say I am.
Need some help?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
You're Chuck Noland.
Thought you were going to bring her.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
Trying.
What about the sender?
Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Kamal is not here.
Who is this? Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here. We are very defused.
How'd it go?
You what?
I'm touched.
You fucked us over.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
And never take.
You are one sick fucker.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Ninety five percent? Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
Malaysia's tanking. We're meeting in ten in operations.
Hello?
God damn! God damn! Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I beat the odds!
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah!
To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
What?
That's what it's about.
Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it.
What, then?
Deliver this package. Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Thanks. For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco. And you?
Only if you can afford it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What's she so emotional about?
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
So, Mrs...
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
Really?
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
Oh...
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
So. Not bored yet?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
And what did she die of, exactly?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I *know* this was right.
It will be okay.
Olive told me. You might have told me yourself.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Nothing.
I know. Is *that* nothing.
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
Please don't make me say it again.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
How is that Wally doing?
Hi...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
They wanted a girl.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh... it's the end of October.
Did you bite it?
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
At what altitude?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
They're migrants.
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
He doesn't like it. He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I thought it was my turn.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
It's just my heart.
So what?
Do you like to read?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
You okay, Rose?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
You're not yet three months, are you?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
That's *it*?
That's it.
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't this place look like home?
It look nicer then home!
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
What's this?
Let's just slow down for a second...
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
Grifters...
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
Nice.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Ten is standard, sir.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Whoa. What?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Masters of our own destiny.
Jake...
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Shit.
I told you, use less powder.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
It can buy you a new and better you.
You know what we're doing with the money.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
She up for this?
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
So that's it...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I have a good crew.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Why?
How much?
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Excuse me?
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Something stupid.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What -- What do we do?
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
That's not --
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
No. What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
What?
And some new clothes.
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Lighten up.
Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
What about...
What about what?
Sorry. I didn't know...
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
Tick-tock...
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Stop waving that thing around.
Yeah.
Meet me at my place later.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
We're working for the King.
What do we need another Shill for?
Why?
Uh...
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Escorts!
And we got rid of the red head.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
King ain't gonna like this.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young. Stand up.
What?
Stand up.
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Can't say.
Then who's the Banker?
It's not history.
Still time.
Ten percent.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
The King, huh? Nice going.
What?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
Did he buy it?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You guys awake?
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Good... I gotta go. So, what do you have for me?
You sell it.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
High five.
I'm Bella.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What kind of deal you looking to?
What's the Blue Book price?
How about fifteen hundred?
How about five hundred.
What?!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Did she? You were pretty thick at one time.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
Who was he?
I don't gamble.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Last hand.
I get it.
Good night?
Not particularly.
And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Where did you get it?
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
You're my prisoner.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Are you drunk?
Marion, stop this.
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here? You know the rules.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it.
It's the truth.
The door, Jack.
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I hope it brings you luck.
I'll leave the casino soon. I promise.
You will?
What?
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Never. Why do you ask?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Gambling's not about money.
Really?
How did you know I was here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion! What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
What?
I want to buy a car.
Great.
Found a job?
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.
Oh hello.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
To coincidence.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Near the casino.
In the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I know that. But you can now.
I don't have any money. switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I can't do it, Jani.
I want you to forget what I said.
Wait a minute...
How much do you owe?
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.
What for?
Is it yes?
Yes.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
It's all relative. I need the money too.
Do you?
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
And your hand too.
Would you like a drink?
I don't think we should meet again.
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Who...
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You did?
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
Over the river.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
You've done pretty well.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What are you, a cop?
You're talking about complicity.
Who are these guys?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
I put them on together.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
You use two alternating, don't you?
We do.
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
How many aces are left?
Five.
I make it six.
What makes you so sure?
You want me to check?
I don't gamble.
Ever?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Girlfriend?
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
You can start Monday week.
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Does he win?
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
How do you feel, Jack?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What was that, I didn't hear...
What the hell?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Check at six minutes.
Armed.
Thanks.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
You are false data.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Hey, bomb...
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
Yes, well...
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Mafhkin oble groop...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
New star. Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
What are you gonna name it?
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Fred.
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

-- Remark.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
TALBY!
I need a diameter approximation.
I like it up here.
You know what I think about, Talby?
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Not now!
Doolittle! Help me.
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
No kidding?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Sir?
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
How I make my living, what's your point?
I'm on a break.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine. So call her. Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
How come I never hearda you before?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
What the hell are you doing?
Who's Camille?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Leave. Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
What are you doing here?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What is it?
It's a sweep. C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
No way.
But I'm afraid of--
Where'd you clip this?
I didn't. It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so. Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story. Not interested.
What're you looking for?
I ain't mad at you...
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.
What a creep.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
You didn't...
Oh my God! In here! IN HERE!
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Can you help me get her back?
We're not going that route. Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Hello...
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Sophy? Are you okay?
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
You're a thief?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You have good taste. French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Whoever that is.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
Wasn't that hard.
So now you tracked me down. What d'ya think?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Is the social studies class over for today?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
I won't be staying.
It was open.
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent?
Bent.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex! We've been through all this.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Yes on all counts.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
We got separated right away. I never knew how many made it.
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
What's in it for you?
Your help.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
What's this?
I don't know what to say.
You are involved. By being alive you're involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
I need to talk to her.
Max something. I got no clue where she stays.
Any idea when she'll be back?
None.
Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.
Who are you?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Oh?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
I understand.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Then what?
Then what? That's it. That's all I got.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
You're crazy.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me. I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Straight.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
What guys do. 'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Where?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
Not right now? Okay, when?
I actually know how this works.
Who are you?
And she bought that?
Make the call.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Tell everybody hey.
Catch you back at the wall.
Quitting time. Grab a cold one?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
We gotta talk.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes. The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
She tells you how I've been--
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out. She deserves better.
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max. You... Rock...
Easy Sketchy.
No, I'm serious. That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Okay, okay, okay--
That was extreme! Did you see that one guy--
This is a hot run. Beat it. You're late.
I was on call.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's sick.
What about this?
Thanks, miss.
What the hell is that?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
You love him?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
What's that?
No problem.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
We've got to take this slow...
Right, slow...
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Coming dad. I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What's it worth to you?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What are you, high?
Yeah.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
What's in Sandusky?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
What the fuck!
Uh... dudes?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
I think we should try sneaking in.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Could be.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Jam, listen up.
Hawk?
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Cool.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
They're what?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
It was stolen!
I got...
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Ahh, sunshine.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
But, mom!
Grounded for the rest of the year?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
What?!
Mom, what're we...?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
That's it?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
A bustier?
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
I did it! I did it! We won!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
It's gone.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Yeah, you did!
Good morning, mongrels!
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
What was his name?
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Theoretically.
Like a DeLorean.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
I didn't say shit.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
How can you do that?
Why did you make me flood the school?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
We went to a hotel.
Hey...
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Why is that?
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are you going?
Donnie?
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
What happened to your neck?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
And what?
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
Who?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What's wrong with you?
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Did you call the cops?
What?
Come with me.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
People aren't that simple.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Grandma Death.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Do they know yet?
Know what?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Oh, shit!
Grandma Death.
You're my only son...
Who is Frank?
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Cellar door.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
Frank.
I think he saved my life.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Yes.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
What about your family, Donnie?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Nothing.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know... Fucking.
Yes.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
Where are we going, Donald?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
I can see him right now!
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't. She worries about you.
Her name is Gretchen.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I... What can we do?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
What?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He was a year ahead of us?
Excuse me?
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
That's enough.
How did you know --
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
It is a big deal.
What else?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Yep.
How did this happen?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose.
Chut up!
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
What is this shit?
Wicked.
No more fuckin' for her.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You're what?!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, never have kids.
What is wrong with you?
Okay.
This came for you, sweetie.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Airport Ho-Jo!
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Yah?
Mrs. Leeman?
Huh?
Amber...
I'm gonna need more caps.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Go on! Get out!
Ow!
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bye mom.
We was robbed.
I hate her!
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
What're you doin' here?
What?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
I know.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Loretta, shut it.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
So? Be real easy.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
That's right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Lester?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
So help me, Gladys.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Oh! What is it?
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Uh, Gladys?
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Harold!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Take a letter.
Who to?
My dear President... read it back...
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right... take out "President"... now read it.
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Is that all?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100. Yours very truly... Send that immediately.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Here I am, Father...
Send for my car...
But you're my father -
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
About - thirty-four seconds.
Father...
Who to?
Yes, sir.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
In her dressing room? Why, what could he be doing there?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
'At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
What do I get?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
Send in the next girl.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
You no gotta no gun.
I can't do it...
Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine. We gotta him.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Go ahead.
You don't understand. This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough! This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
You swine!
Give me that again!
You worm!
Once more!
You upstart!
Then it's war?
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!!
What I called you... Why, what did I call you?
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Oh, Rufus!
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Take a seat -- you're next.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
What is money? Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh. Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Oh, would you...?
So that's the one you want to marry.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
I've always thought that myself.
You won't be long?
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
John loves the house.
Yes.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Yes?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What is it?
Like this.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
He fell. He falls.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
This man belongs in hospital.
I want my man back.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
You don't own this man!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Oh yes?
I don't understand.
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Yes, I think I can.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
...everyone has been very kind.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
I don't know what I've got.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oh, no.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
You've never been?
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no?
How awful for John.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
You alright?
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Oh, yes.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Thank you very much.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Yes.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
What's this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
...Yes potatoes... but...
You did not ask me.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
Yes.
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Your mother?
Good morning, John.
Good morning.
Yes, John?
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
My home.
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
No, John, not one that I can see.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir. What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
HE'S GONE!
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Right! Where is he?
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's your fantasy...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
WHY?
Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
We mustn't let him land!
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
I'll bring it back.
But you don't realize....
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
The second note.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But --
But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Is there nothing men can do?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
How?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Would you like us to sing to you?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
REALLY?
Really.
No.
We're just not a very musical nation...
No.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
Careful! They're not supposed to hurt you.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Yes... oh, yes...
But it IS! Look!
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
What?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
Scream.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I didn't mean to!
You told them I raped you -- why?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
What a stupid idea.
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Why should you care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
But...
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What's wrong with making friends?
That's terrible!
Halfdan the Black's here!
I know!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
What's it all about?
What?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
I want to die... No, I don't!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there.
Row!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
You need to say a bit more than that!
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
I think we should go...
Right. Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Well, what else do we do?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But HOW?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
What do we have to do?
How did he do that?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Same thing, isn't it?
You know, my son, our lord said...
Your lord.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
What?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Sh! Hurry!
YOU do it!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Relax!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
Help!
Shut up!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
It's a tradition.
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
There is nothing we can do...
He drove me mad!
Easy, Dad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
You weren't supposed to see that.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Thanks, guys.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
I did. You said, things were fine.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
And I just liked you so much.
No, it was lovely.
May I help you?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Ms. Kruczynski?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
Oh, Tangerine.
Come up to Boston with me?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
What's wrong with me?
How are you today?
I'm sorry.
Why?
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Really?
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Rockville Center.
Really? Because --
I don't have one.
I like it.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Okay.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're sure? It's cold.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
It's okay.
Where do you live?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
So you like bookstores, huh?
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Um --
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I'm fine.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I should probably get going.
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?
No. I --
Thanks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah, I guess.
Okay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You should stay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Let me drive you home.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
How can you watch this crap?
Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
What?!
I don't want to talk about this here.
So, um --
You're drunk.
No, it isn't that.
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
More?
Joely...
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you, Clem.
There's this guy!
Really? Is he cute?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
Is that what you want?
Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Okay.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Oh God, how horrid.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I know.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think she's great.
Me too. There's this poem --
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think, before.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
Female.
Cool.
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Hey, Joel --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a bully...
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
Yeah?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
It's true.
Hi, it's Joel.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Hi.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
So then she just stops calling.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
How's the chicken?
Okay. I wish you could come.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
You have to stop this!
Yours?
So what's going on, Joel?
What?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
Hi.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
I miss you.
Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
Definitely!
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
See you later, alligator.
'kay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's freezing out.
You found us okay?
Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
It's stopped.
What?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Where?
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!
Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
No way. I can handle this.
He's coming?
You better go.
Hey.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
How did I look?
Oh.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
Nothing.
I know what it is.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Howard, your one o'clock.
Mary...
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Okay, we're back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
It's no big deal.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We can't do this.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
Stan? What's going on?
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Mary. What are you doing here?
I tried that already.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Oh, hi.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
The voltage looks fine.
Does that help?
Yeah?
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Clockworks.
What do you believe in then?
Is everything getting worse?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
You don't?
A traveler, eh?
Where are the others?
Tell me about it.
No, I guess not.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
How does she like what in bed?
What do you think?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
I'm cold.
What are you doing?
I have to go, Julian.
Going north?
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Ballast.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Holy shit...
Justin?
Time to play Spam in the can.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
We have a man down...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
What?
Coffee.
No, he didn't.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Do you hear it? Right there.
Hear what?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What happened?
Please...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
Thank you.
It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What, Justin, what shows you?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
How do you know all this?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
This is Weir.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
What's the hold up?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
I found one.
Alive?
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
...how's the client?
Can anybody hear me...
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
That's a negative, Starck.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
What does it say?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
No one?
Yes.
What could cause them? What's in the Core?
If it worked.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
What do you want me to say?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
We're leaving.
Don't... don't do this...
You... You can't do that!
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Your eyes...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
What are you?
You know.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
Heading three-three-four...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Yes, sir.
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
It is now. We're locked in.
Captain Miller...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Sir.
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
Skipper...
What is it, Smith?
Smith, get out of there...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
We're all here.
It tastes bad.
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
What's causing the readings?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Miller...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
You've got to listen...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
What?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
Weir.
First time in a grav couch?
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Keep him talking.
Almost got it.
We have to do something, oh God...
You got any coffee?
It's cold.
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
What?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Get them back --
A straight line.
What is it?
What is it?
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Five times.
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
What?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're hot!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
What is that thing?
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
They're ready for you, sir.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Are you kidding?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Why didn't you say something?
I can... make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Of course.
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Totally.
I can't find it, mon!
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
Are you still a virgin?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
See you later.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
You're a really good kisser.
So are you. Are you shaking?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
Hey, Mike?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
No.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Are you Linda Barrett?
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
How've you been?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How often do you go?
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Don't you like him?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
He was hot, wasn't he?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Was it great?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
That little prick.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
What do you want?
I want romance.
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
If you graduate.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You look like you could still be in high school.
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.' You look nice tonight.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
Is this your first time?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.
You keep them.
What's your other question?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Are you all right?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Where's your brother?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
...I've got to go home.
Do you really have to go?
Where's Mike today?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Killed?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Dobermans don't talk.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
A major!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Oh, my God!...
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Jesus! Did I say that?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
...and we're chock full of that!
Damn right!
Where's the medicine?
Shoot it.
That's good...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Can we make it?
When does this thing stop?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Where'd you get that knife?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
What limes?
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What tape?
How about a check?
I want that fucking radio!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Jesus.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
WELL? What are your plans?
Plans?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
Where'd you get this?
Some of what?
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
We can't risk letting them in.
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
They'll be back.
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where is everyone?
IS IT CLEAR?!
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Who the hell would you call?
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
Where's that?
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Oh!
Wha?
We'll be food, dickheads!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the rest of 'em?
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Fuck you too.
Scared?
No. You?
Ohhh.
What?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Just an observation.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Why don't you go check it out?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
We gotta be close.
What's in the back?
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
What is this?
Magic potion. You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
How much you got?
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
Huh?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
What's going on between you two?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Am I too heavy for you?
OH JESUS!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Let's move.
What's wrong?
Let's go.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
And the last one is the...
Okay, well that's something.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Her name is Charlie.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Did we make it?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Well... come on.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances? Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Who's this?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Thank you --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
My clothes?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I'm not!
You're afraid!
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Huh.
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
What's up?
Who?
An actress.
A rich actress.
I know, but --
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Claire?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
...Yes.
Without me.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
All square, Doc.
I know you believe that.
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
...I see.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Really?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
Were you a drug addict?
Bye, baby.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Thanks, Dad.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.
...So what do you think?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
Thank you.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Good.
See you next weekend?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Kurt!
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Oh, Kurt!
Age?
Fifteen.
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
They'll mend.
What?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!
Don't touch me.
Okay then...
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Yeah, well --
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
How'd I look?
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
Quietly.
What happened to him?
...So you think I should go.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
Frances...
What?
How ya doin', Farmer?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Kaminski.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Yeah.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, the studio told me not to.
You're telling me.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Don't start, Farmer.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Calm down, Frances.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
What for?
I took the early rounds.
No, Harry, I can't --
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
I should've known...
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
I guess.
What's that?
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What a man!
To quarter-horses.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Huh?
There's just one more thing.
What's that?
You give up on her?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you... ...ennh.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I'm not sure.
Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
That would be okay.
Pretty morning.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
What'd you do?
Shit!
...Is that not true?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
What happened? Who're you?
Who're you?
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
But I want to. I'm trying!
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
'But how do I know you love me?'
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You got it.
Mama...
I don't care.
It's okay.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I think I need a little air.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Say you promise.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Excuse me.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
I see.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
And what's that?
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says.
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Is there something else?
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
What?
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Symington says...
No! No!
You're kidding.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
You were with him at the end.
Yes.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
What kindness?
Nice.
Better that way... for me.
Why?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
You're an outcast.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
People can be kinder than you think.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil? Do you believe in evil?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Materials. Nothing more.
I don't know.
What can I do?
There is something I want. A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Soon?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Why... her?
What is this?
A brain. Extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
You dance so beautifully together.
Must've been a terrible row.
Nothing. Still nothing.
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
Are you all right?
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Only you.
You make me weak.
Our decision. Together.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Victor. I love you,
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I've no choice
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I thought I'd never see you again!
What sort of task?
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It is
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Brother and sister no more.
Victor!
It's going to ram us.
A warming wind.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Are you having me on?
Henry Clerval.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You're making a scene!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
How much longer?
You've been going round-the-clock?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
Quite a place.
Thank you, Henry.
What happened up there?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
Victor, explain yourself.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Do you share my madness?
Who are you?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Tomorrow is another day.
Melvin Belli.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Alice.
Cabin B is ready.
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Oh, my God...
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Good point.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Marcie?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
What's the matter with it?
How come?
I'll be along.
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
Claudette...
Somebody'll see.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
I had to.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
I don't believe you...
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Holy shit...
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
Jack?
How about our last jay?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
I don't love Neddy.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Ned!
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Whassamatta?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
Anything else you want?
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
Yeah. I got it on before this -- -- all started.
That's thirty percent.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
You like the car?
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Why do you want to stop?
I'm exhausted.
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
On the dresser.
Not a chance.
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes.
Who's this?
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Is this real?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
Now, is your shit together?
In the Winnebago.
Did he...?
I promise.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm going for 'em!
No!
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?
Do what?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
Yeah.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Not even for lunch?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
Yeah?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Gotcha!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have cable?
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
How's it feel?
Feels good.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Where's the woman?
She's in the other room.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Seth, if you were me --
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
They're gonna search the van.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Keep your voice down.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
You okay?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
What?
We are... "South of the border down Mexico way."
Far out. Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
How?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
My shit is together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
Yeah, it's mine.
You could take their head off.
B.O.Q., south side. Take a starboard tack out the door.
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Who's... Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did. Not for me.
Got it.
Wow...
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
"Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?
Yes, of course. Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
None at this time, sir.
It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Straight up?
Then good night.
See me, sir?
Permission to leave, sir?
I'm not sure what --
Sir? What did he say?
Aw, what is this...
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo. South?
Entering my scan now...
Shit. Think we're had.
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks. Lemme do it.
Banditos on the east perimeter! 150 yards! Shit, she was part of it!
White House boys want a private meeting.
Yes?
Did you hear?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
Uh, question, ma'am.
Yes, dear.
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
You know him.
Sounds familiar.
What changed?
Should probably ask him that.
You don't know that.
I'm sure it is.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey. You okay, Flea?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
I can make this wall without --
Come on, Montgomery...
O'Neil?
Sir?
Time.
She's an officer. There's a higher standard.
I oughtta report you.
Thank you, sir. But I like these just fine.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Gotta situation here. Where are you? Stuck in traffic?
Chances of recovery?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part. Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
Me? Why me?
Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Jordan. You watch your ass.
Almost like someone put him up to it. Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.
C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle." The Chief.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"In Washington..."
What?
I'd sure like to know who.
Which is guy-speak for...
They're more afraid of you.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again. Especially at your age.
Hey. Way to gut it out.
Who is it?
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Wick. They got your crew, too?
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
O'Neil?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
That's okay. Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out. Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
What're you guys doing? Huh?
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
England went out with a stress fracture. That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Simple question, lieutenant. No reason not to answer. What is your father's name?
"Dad."
Any brothers? Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
You are in the cage, O'Neil. Right here, right now.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's not right.
That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Do you?
No.
Sure. Just like your men do.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Say again? How many micks?
Got it.
O'Neil...
Well, who the shit you think you are? Comin' in here like that?
That your desk? I'll take this one.
Clear.
Sure. Now she wants to shoot.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Can't live with them, can't kill them. What's the point?
You mind? I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Subject?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
I like that image.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
I'll take them all.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Most people don't.
And you think this creature is one of them?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
How do you know?
Are you okay?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What the hell are you doing?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Well, I think you're cute.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Have them sealed off.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
You're fast.
That is our job.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
It's Tatopoulos.
Right. The worm guy. Can someone get those people off the beach?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
What sample?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You gave them the tape?
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
We've met before.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
So you're in?
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
How do I do that?
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
It's Raymond.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just don't.
This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Sir, it's you Thank Ipthar!
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze. Where is everyone?
Sir! The pressure. It's normalizing.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
God, what an ass.
Calm down everybody. We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
NO! WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
About this much.
What's the scale? Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
What? What?
Nothing.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
I was staying in character. "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
~hex! Alex, are you oKav?
Yes. Good was done this .....
He's a twit!
Not again...
What the hell is going on?!!?
He wants to THINK!?
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one!
What's happened?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
May I get the check?
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
You said "the Commander.
What?
No I didn't.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Oh. Okay.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
... Yes?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's your name, son?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Yes...?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
Go. They're off again.
Up.
What? Up?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Yes?
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
Right.
As good as Hopkins?
How do you remember this stuff?
You Okay, Alex?
...The digital conveyor.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
They're still behind us...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre?
Hi everybody.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III." Episode... 31 I think.
We're doing episode 31?
They're gone.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
Not a clue. You?
~e're alive!
What?
It's Jason...
One minute I'm - Hey, I'm dressing.'
Let me try. Computer? Computer?...
Only answers to me.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Jason..
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Are they behind us?
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
You're playing your good side.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
What? What did he say?
Jason?... I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
There's no hatch. There's no hatch!
Because it was on the show!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
Unbelievable.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
That's it, It's go time.
You should have let me hit him.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
I heard it too.
JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Closer? I can try.
Tommy, look! Those lights...
Yes.
Is it a bomb? A booby trap? Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Explain -
We pretend...
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
I... certainly, but-
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini. Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
Commander...
Mathesar? What is that?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
But...Why?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Wh... Where are we?
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Where?
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
What kind of signal?
Anything.
Okay, I'll do this... "Caw Caw!"
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
NO NO NO.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Continue forward, sir?
Find them.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Well, now there's something worth dying for. What do you think?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Over three hundred miles.
Arnold!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
What do you think, George, shall I resign? It's what they want.
The army needs you.
Well, George, who were you?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
That can't be.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!?
Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun! You know that!
Misunderstood what!?
A lot of years have gone by.
What? What are you talking about?
Me? You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Yes, general.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No uniforms. No coats, even? In this weather?
Yes, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back. I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
That's Greene. He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
With pleasure... and an honor. Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Sir, I think no such thing.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
This is a declaration of insurrection! Who wrote this!?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Who's in command out there?
Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
Partially...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Unofficially, General Greene.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.
Colonel Reed...
A grand scheme?
And, Hamilton? Greene?
The man is a traitor!
I... they look both the same.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
I rode here, on my horse.
What is it, Marquis?
My God! Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
I feel the same, sir.
It's another demonstration against the king. This is the wildest yet.
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
Of course, if it were that simple. These people? They're after something else...
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else? From Virginia?
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Martha! For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Not today.
I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them. Are you all right?
Colonel Washington? Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine. It's their nature.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Well, this must be about something!
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, you know I only love you, but...
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Really? Which precious homily was it?
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa, of course.
Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Or, 'civilized'.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
It's the freest land on earth.
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
They can use their imaginations.
I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
That's good... who?
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
You hear that?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Juba was a Numidian.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You get the money?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
And that's for the airport.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Not too bad.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
You gave him the money?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
What's this movie you're doing first?
You can talk to me.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Who?
That's all there is to it, huh?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What money?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Karen? You okay?
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Where's Karen?
She's great. Gimme the money.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
I don't know.
C-18.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Or else what?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
How'd you get in here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Why would I do that?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Who the fuck are you?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
That's what I'd do. Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
What've you got?
Have we met? I don't recall.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Keep going.
That's it? That's your movie?
Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
One of his best parts.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
He drown?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Really.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Yeah. That was a good party.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
What's that?
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How'd you know I was here?
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer. Works for Jimmy Capp.
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
Sounds fair.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
You okay?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
I told you not to -
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
Hello, Doris.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Harry -
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Fucker!
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
What's so great about Sweden?
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
The turbine blew.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
Roger.
Roger?
You think that's funny
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What other choices have we got?
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
So we kill him?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Smokes?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Dodge. Dodge.
What?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
If you get it back in one piece.
Mother fucker!
What is it?
What's this?
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
How long?
Three, four days.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Or somebody stopped them.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Dodge to Murphy.
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What is it?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
The radio!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You smashed it!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
You're late.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's what I call a payday.
That's a good thing?
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
Candy?
Coffee?
She was sailing up north, right?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
What?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
February first.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.
Not our mystery guest again.
Showing you what?
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
What happened?
We hit land.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
Greer to Murphy.
Of course they did.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Yeah.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
It's funny.
How's that?
Murphy, goddamit.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Morning.
You're up late.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
I heard that.
What now?
We could call for help.
Greer?
I don't know.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Ho-ly shit.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Shut up.
It's a Noaa buoy.
A what?
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Better late than never.
What's this?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
No, no. You got leak.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
Hi. Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
But I can't --
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Dana! Hi! Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what can you tell us about this...
Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
...wow...
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
It's not optional!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
So Josh...
That guy rules!
Aren't there a million places like this?
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Yeah, right.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Hi Josh.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
Do you want something to drink?
Why?
Yeah, right...
"Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hi Enid.
Hey Josh.
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
How perfect.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Good.
Hi.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you sign up yet?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
I might actually get the pasta special.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
Why do I always have to do it?
You're better at it.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
Do you think he knows?
Are you sure?
He's insane!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This is way too creepy.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Ew, look at this...
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That was truly pathetic.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Not really...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
Just promise you'll do it.
We still have to go in there sometime.
It's always closed...
Where are we going?
Let's go hassle Josh.
There he is...
As always.
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
How about this?
I know a party we could go to...
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I totally, totally hate you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That guy is totally amazing.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
But those are our people...
Like what?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You're gross. See that guy?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Go ahead...
No, really...
Look, we have to get these...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
Hello?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
How repulsive!
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? That must be it...
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I said "great"...
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Hello?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
So, whaddya think?
It's fine.
There.
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Well, we won't keep you.
May I ask what you're doing?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Seymour does.
Who does?
You still interested in that?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Didn't they tell you?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
That's not even --
Oh, how "punk."
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
Norman.
...are you waiting for a bus?
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.
What?
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Well why do I care about that?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Indian records?
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
How much is it?
A dollar seventy-five.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
NO!!!
Oh, right...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Well are --
I - I'd really rather not...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Shh!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yes, that would certainly do...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
You can open your eyes now.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Are you okay?
What is that?
What, like a girdle?
Really?
Wow! What was that all about?
How can you be so sure?
Uh... hello?
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
What? You're kidding me...
Boo!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
So where would we go?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What do you want?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
But, I...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Please Josh?
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.
I am.
What do we have here, Margaret?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Thank you, doctor.
Seymour?
Yes?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Starting now, we attack them.
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
And it worked?
What?
Understand, I had help-
You're certain about tomorrow? But you don't seem excited.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
You never had it.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
That's a terrible idea-
Oh dear- -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Go, now. Such a gentleman.
Very good indeed.
Anything special about them?
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
Finish your tour?
I don't suppose I could watch.
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
...one shot...
How lucky we are.
Aren't we full of ourselves today? I think it's because of the lion.
All right- thee second embankment will go there.
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
Actually, no.
All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard.
That's very considerate.
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Has it ever done that before?
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
But of course yours worked.
What happened to them?
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You think they'll come then? Why?
Good luck.
Why?
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
Oh yes, I think so.
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
Soon.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
He has children?
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Where do you go next?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything? You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
I won't.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a building superintendent.
Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
Okay, that's no problem.
His name is Oscar.
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Or we could do that.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I'm not even good for me.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you. I think I do too.
That's not true. It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
Can I help you?
Who are you going to call?
Well, good night, Louis.
Should we go?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here.
I know.
You know, I never got to ask you. Where you from, Johnny?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
That's it? That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist. I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there.
Yes, I did. We were city champs.
Egon!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it? "I'll be back?"
Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
It's working. The positive GeV's are climbing.
Pretty impressive, huh?
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Who was that?
Nothing. Not a trace.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
I'm Egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
That's it. It's on the bottom.
Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great. So what are you guys working on?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who? Just -- someone we know.
Who? Who? Who?
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
And now you're going to eat it?
Like a goat on garbage.
What happened?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Ready?
I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh? What?
You finished here?
What? Yeah.
Are you all right? You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, I just thought --
Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to do -- drown me?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Tell him about the toaster.
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
How deep does it get? That water's cold and I can't swim.
Aren't you glad we waited?
I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
Roy? Your clock broke.
Nice going, honey. It was brand new.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Uuuuuuugh!!
Is it a star?
Ready? What is it?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No. They're just coming to me.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Eight o'clock?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument.
Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
No? What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
What?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
Damn!
Are you all right?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
All right. What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it. Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
All right.
Okay. Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I am Zuul. I am ...
There is no Dana. I am Zuul.
Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high.
That is one speedy mutt.
He's a big one. You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it? What was it?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
I want you to have this.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway. I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Can I help you?
I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Great! How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see. And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
In a storage facility.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
All right. What is it?
A square?
Circle?
Nervous?
Yes. I don't like this.
Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one?
Two wavy lines?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister! Can I see those guns?
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah. I just want to see 'em.
Yes?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Oh! You're here.
What have you got, Egon?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm always serious.
Something was definitely here.
Wait! Wait! There's something I forgot to tell you.
What?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me. It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
All right. I'll try.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
She said he was "the Destructor."
Who?
Gozer.
What now?
On the count of three! One ... Two ...
Life is just a state of mind.
Sorry, Buddy!
Ray! Where are you? Are you all right?
It's working!
Set entry grid.
What happened??!!!?
What do you mean by "seen?"
Looked at with your eyes.
What is it?
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I don't know. Talk to it.
What do I say?
For what purpose?
You'll never regret this, Ray.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Everybody can relax. I found the car. How do you like it?
Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
How was your date?
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor. Get down here,
Sit tight. I'm on my way.
It's here, Ray. It's looking at me.
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Who was the architect?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it! It just popped in there!
What? What popped in there?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
No. But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
And the seas would boil ...
Right. And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Stantz? You okay in there?
What's he talking about? Choose what?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon? And stay there?
More wine, sister? Surely you can drink more than that.
Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Where have you been?
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
What are you talking about?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
That's difficult to say, general.
Then you'd be out of a job.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
They won't break this one.
Where is my family?
Caesar, ignore them.
Yes. You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Why isn't he dead? Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You're hearing about somebody else.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.
Why you?
Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
You cannot die.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
Servis made it through again?
The Senators admire you.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
I was summoned.
He's very realistic.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
You need to come home!
I can see that...
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
You teach them!
Take your hands off me animal!
I refuse to be your slave. I refuse --
I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
How much money is involved?
Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive.
Before they leave, get gold.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
No.
Why not?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
No -- why should I?
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Benjamin --
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Do you?
Was she married or something?
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
All right.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Okay.
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I do.
You do?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry.
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Is that him over there?
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Here? In Berkeley?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
I want to ask you a question.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
What?
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Let me go.
Why?
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
My belt.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
I don't understand.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
What?
You won't?
I don't know.
But you might.
I might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.
When?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Thank you.
Ben!
Excuse me. Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
You're not one of those agitators?
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What did you do to her?
Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
BENJAMIN?
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
What?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Yes sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
Is there an ashtray in here?
No.
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
You don't?
No.
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What for?
But it's light in there now.
All right then.
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you think of me?
What do you mean?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
No.
What?
Oh my God.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
Like what?
What do you think?
So?
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Benjamin?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Where is it?
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Yes.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
How are you?
May I have a drink?
He didn't see me.
Did you get us a room?
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
The number.
What?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
Well.
Benjamin.
Yes?
Why don't you watch?
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
How about art.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Oh.
Don't you?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Go ahead then.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Can I take off my clothes now?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
Do you want to hear it or not?
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
There isn't any.
How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Always?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
No.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.
And you were a student also.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Kind of.
Well how did it happen?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
I wish you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
Are you?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now don't start this.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
Did I say that?
You wouldn't.
What are you doing?
If that's how you feel --
But it's not.
You don't have to say that.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you. Benjamin --
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I don't believe you.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
No -- actually I'm not --
Braddock -- Braddock?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
What else?
Nothing else.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Oh, no.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Why did you say that?
Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Not if you don't want to.
I do.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Swell. I appreciate it.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
I will.
Hello.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
But why?
Why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
-- before he does -- You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
What's happening?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
Turn 'em up.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Have you a minute now?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
I want to speak --
Not now.
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Need any help?
No.
No --
Why?
I could take care of her.
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
I've quit.
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
How?
I have an idea working in my head...
Like dancing?
Never?
You're a fool!
He must be very nice.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Very little.
Poor child -- I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
What?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Going?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight.
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Why do you look at me like that?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
And...?
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
Why do you smile?
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really?
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
There.
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
And now?
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
No?
Why do you think --
Why?
I'm worried about you.
Don't.
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
Not at all, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Yes, quite.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
We could come to my room.
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
I take five hundred.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
The war.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
For me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Any letters?
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
Barman -- whiskey -- For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
What, Doctor?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. Oh, the pain.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
Oh, I've got to find it.
Stay where you are.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
Her master's voice! I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Dance then?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Yes.
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
You dance splendidly.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Really?
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Oh yes, of course.
Do you like me better?
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What...! --
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs.
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
Movies?
What is this?
You...
You...
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing?
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
Miss Flaemm.
Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
Well -- you want me?
Yes.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
I understand perfectly.
Of course -- of course.
A thousand marks --
Can you pay some attention to me?
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're sweet.
Come here.
Oh, no.
Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
What?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Sorry, Preysing.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
I can't dance tonight --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Madam should sleep.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
I wish to be alone.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
It is time for the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
He will be on the train.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Again?
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
You're discharged.
Me?
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.
Four minutes past. Please come.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Hi, Bobo.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
No.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Permanent damage.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Roy? He's always crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Here you are! Two rich people!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I know.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Well, uh... No.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They knocked out my tooth!
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
What's that?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
Expecting visitors?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No.
As though you do what I say.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
You're getting off the grift?
That's right.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
I didn't teach you that.
Let me see how you did that one.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Are you sure?
Roy?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Her job.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
That's just Lilly's way.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Big spender.
No.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
What?
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Think about it. Okay?
Yeah?
Open your door.
What? What for?
You were gone for a while.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
) What?
Roy Dillon?
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I realize this is a shock.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Not that it matters. This is the morgue?
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
That's that, then.
Mr. Simms.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Why am I here?
Well, when you put it that way.
Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Impressive, Blake. Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
The cemetery...
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Care to join me?
Yes.
Carter.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Funny, we just drove right in.
A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police? What difference does it make?
Another historical inaccuracy.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.
Oh. Sorry. I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
No. Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear. The coast is clear.
You sure?
Totally. I checked all the rooms and closets...
My office?
What the --
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Where are you going?
You're twisted.
Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?!
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly? She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What? Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Shelve the barf bag. It's the key to the main gate.
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Not me.
Why not?
What are you doing here?!
I came to see you.
I can see that. Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy? You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You look kind of cold.
I'm okay.
Better?
Linda! He killed Linda!
Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great. It does.
You okay? You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange...
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth.
I can't believe this is happening.
Are you going to leave, too?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Yeah.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Look, they're staring right at us.
Wait.
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Fuckin' A.
What's this?
Better her than me.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
He do that to you?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why? You interested?
Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Jesus, that's my neighbor. Tommy.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
Shh. Mommy's here. What is it?
But I've seen him!
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things. Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom. We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
I can't. The voice man is coming to get me.
No one's coming to get you. Not while I'm around.
Promise?
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property. I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here. In our house.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
I've been knocking. The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Who are you?
Jamie? But I thought she was --
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God! What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
God, what's wrong with him?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Where's the baby?!
Danny! Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Come on!
But surely Rogers isn't --
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There you are. Who was that boy?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home. Checked it out myself.
What's wrong? What's happened to Jamie?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy. What are you doing here?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!! Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do. I would rather the women didn't.
Home. Jesus. I'm like this. Home!
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
No.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Um.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.
Home.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that. And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
This room is full of ghosts.
You know what gets me?
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before. This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home! Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel. It's been beautiful.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
The educational process.
What's funny about that?
Excuse me.
How do you know that?
You told me.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh. I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me. I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging? Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Of course you'll go! You're going to fly the helicopter.
I dunno.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy. You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
Okay. Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so. It could have been.
Hello.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Our pleasure.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Insurance!
What an awful sound!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I've considered that.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
You invited me.
To make an ass of yourself.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
You're my buddy.
Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Dr. Woodly.
Dr. Woodly. I should make a little list.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency. I think it was birth.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
Ah! And what sort of man is this worshiper?
She met him at college.
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
He insults him all the time.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
No.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing. He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"Dad?" Dad. The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Oh hell.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
The story gets hairier. Should I stop?
Mhravitch. Remember that name.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days. It isn't there any more.
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are. He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Yes, wife, it is. Come here, boy. Your father is home.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's Saturday. Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir. If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do? Mom!
Damn.
Play?
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What kind of exercise?
Dad?
Who was it?
Mom?
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Of course it is. Is it loaded?
No.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart! Load that gun!
Then speak, by God! Can you fight with words?
I'm talking to you gently now.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter. How old are you?
Eighteen-- and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman. I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Some kind of animal?
Not at all.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
I don't know. This is a new disease to me.
Disease?
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
What's that all about?
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead-- or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Nothing would please me more.
I'm so glad you like each other. I was so scared, so scared.
Harold!
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Awful. I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
A trip, you mean?
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I have some change!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Which one?
You're wrong.
Chow, chow, chow! God damn it-- nutriment!
Cook, by God! Cook! You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
No.
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
The doctor.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yes.
And no one's there now?
No you're not!
Why not?
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse. He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
He cried.
Two hundred years old.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Things.
Well--what have we here? A family.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
Like what?
He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
No.
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide. Go get the police.
I'm turning off the alarm. I'm turning off everything.
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
You've killed women?
Ooops.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
The door ws unlocked. Is it always unlocked?
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be. We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Hello? Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She's fine. Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go? An emergency!
Yes! Yes! The boy! One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
Safe and sound, I see. Oh--you came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Ah! You're ambulatory!
I know malaria. Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Are you've seen it work cures?
We have, have we?
I thought she was a widow.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
It's healer to killer. Is that the same thing?
Correct.
What an hallucination! Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Oh dearie me.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo. That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Hands and knees, you say?
You're in one hell of a jam. You realize that?
I'm high as a kite.
Glands. You're supposed to be happy when you die. Call me comical again.
You're a clown. You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical. Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
You hope.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No quarter asked. No quarter given.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open. Find out.
I've struck my blow.
Don Quixote.
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
And the hell with it. It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Here. Finish the job.
More clowning! Don't you see?
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You'd be killing a friend. Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man. You can change!
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.
Don't shoot.
No. No.
Get up.
No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
Dead!
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law. Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
And you, Colonel? Let me guess: You don't know.
So long, you guys.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake. I don't really know him.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Aha! Hello! You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Because he was cruel?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
You bet I'll worry about it. I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all. That's all. Who cares about that?
Kid--kid--
What's this?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
I don't want to live any more.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything. Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
Don't touch me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
He's coming back, Mom! He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married! You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I hate that thing.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Who have you been talking to?
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
Mom?
That man is your father.
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
What are his symptoms?
Shivers and sweats and groans. His teeth chatter. What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
Really?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
We don't have a maid any more.
My father!
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I hate that thing.
It came yesterday. I haven't opened it yet.
I didn't get his name. A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
Please--
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Or was. We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
I'm glad.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Yes?
Something happens to my confidence.
I'm touched.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Coming.
Gentlemen! Is this right for a fight? It's been so long.
Beautiful! I've never seen that coat.
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A what?
For Harold. When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
He said one other thing. It wasn't very nice.
What was it?
What's the matter now?
Possibly.
How long has this been going on?
A week. We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
You're saying no.
You were wonderful.
It's true.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Take plenty of cigars.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no! Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
It is?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
We've got to dump Shuttle. He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
And maybe Paul. What about the murderers? They're in there!
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
It's a jungle out there.
You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Do it!
Hi kid. Would you look what the car dragged in.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Kid--kid--
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Yes, we do.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No. I don't think so.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
You mean I'm black?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Yeah.
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
Now, what do you want?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I'm getting angry.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Wait?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
How many weeks?
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Hello. You want some information?
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity's in back.
That's all you got, three girls?
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
What's that shade of blue called?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Overpowering?
Yeah.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so. What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
Yeah.
You making a feature?
Joanne?
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Where is she?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
I thought you were going to bed?
No.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
You don't drink?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah. I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
At least I'm a growing person.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
What rate?
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
What do you care about?
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was. He was with Ratan.
What does that mean? What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Fuck.
I can stop if you want.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.
You really believe all that?
Yeah. Well, mostly.
It's not quite the same thing.
Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
She left you right?
Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
What happened?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
Who's paying you?
You are.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
What have you found out?
Where is she?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Who made it?
I don't know.
But the police...
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Like what?
Where'd you hear that name?
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
What?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What plan?
You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Hey man.
That's not true, Mr...?
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
No.
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Who told you about this?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
What?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
What we got is just these here. What you see.
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
But I...
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
That's all right.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
In other words, you want to get laid?
Sounds all right.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm worried about Jake.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
To his own daughter?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
You working in San Diego now?
Was he with a girl?
No.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
Oh. It looks like a hearse. Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
Not very.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
What do you want?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome. Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Nice to meet you.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
It's very interesting.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
My door is always open.
All right.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Yes. Very much.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette... ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
What happened?
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
But what?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
But this is public property.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.
Look, the ice is melting.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...
No.
Well, I don't...
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
Yes.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right. It's organic.
Yes. I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
Of course.
I like you, Maude.
Look at that sky. It's so big.
It's so blue.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No. I communicate.
With God?
Well, why don't you?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Oh.
Maude, I must speak to you.
What is it, Harold?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
Yes. They're old friends.
Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.
- end where I began.
Maude.
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Supper for two.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.
But why now?
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Mother.
Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
I'm getting married.
To whom?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
What?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
No.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Harold?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
No. I'd have liked to.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Parasite!
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Julia.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
The box. I need the box.
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
O.K. Let's go.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
I... remember.
Steve...
What are you talking about? Who are you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
See what??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Is he serious??
They were over here, Professor.
Don't get psychic with me.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
See? I don't like that --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it -- ?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
What is it?
You are a Catholic??
Here. You'll need one of these.
I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
"Paranormal" But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
Grigory -- That's Russian, right? Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do. How many escapes? This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Who wards off demons.
Son. About Rasputin --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
I worry about you.
Me?? C'mon --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice -- She's human --
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Who's the squirt?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Got tired of me?
I don't want him.
Well, you did break out --
I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
We're on the move.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Sir, may I go first??
She's dead.
I knew those men better than you did --
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
You call that thing a cigar??
Yup.
Thank you.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
Myers??? How's your arm?
Myers?
Yes?
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
What was that??
Where do you --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Not from you.
Well good n-
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Alone?
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Out? Out out?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I like that...
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Marco...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Doesn't sounds like him.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Strong.
He -- loves you.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
But it's not true, is it?
What -- ?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
Christ!
What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
It's important.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
I don't remember.
Oh Christ.
Julia!
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
No.
You remember.
No.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
Oh my God.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh. Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
Well?
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
No. God no.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I'm hurting
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Later.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
A long time.
This is what began it.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
You can't love him.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
She'll tell them everything...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
What happened?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You're still blaming me.
No. I'm not.
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Larry!
Where are you?
Well?
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Larry....
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Julia?
I'm here.
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Fine.
-- I'll go see.
Larry...
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.
Huh?
Please...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
That depends.
You know it's not often I... you know...
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Is this your place ?
Do you care ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Why don't you do the same?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Am I?
Oh Christ.
What's wrong?
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Who brought me in here?
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Who's there?
Kirsty?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
You like?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Surprise.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
...maybe we should never have come back.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
What?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Sure.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Get the fuck out of here.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.
It's late.
Not that late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right. No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
There ya go. I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Oh!
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Are you busy after work ?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Steve. Thank God you came.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What did I say?
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
Really.
You gotta be kidding me.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We'll do it next Monday.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Yeah.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ehh.
Just listen to me. If I said to you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Why would they care?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday.
Suck my ass.
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None. Christ!
What's up?
Laura. Her dad died.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh. Right. But I'd forgotten about that. I wasn't biting the idea.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
What the fuck is that?
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing? Okay, 20%.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Great. Can I have it then?
I have all of the others.
Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Well what about the new Echo --
I have a television.
Holy Shiite! What the fuck's this?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No. The Righteous Brothers.
What?
Nothing.
No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nothing. I just prefer the other one.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks! About six!
We work there!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Who are you going to see?
Anna.
Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?
Don't do it, Rob!
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh. That's me.
Oh. Okay.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Nevermind. Any five. So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Fine. That's great.
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure...
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Charlie.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck! I knew it! You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
What's this?
Hey. Didn't you steal that one already?
I always hated this song.
Let's not.
Rob.
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
Rob --!
Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Can I do anything?
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
Laura? Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no. Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Yeah.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...
Jeez. He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Are you coming home?
Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
-- Alright, alright but --
Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
But don't you remember?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
And do you like it that way?
So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
I think you know that.
I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What?
Did you say something?
No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance --
No problem. If I can ask one question.
Fine. One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better? Better than what?
Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
I'll look for 'em. How you doing?
We'll talk some other time.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Look, I gotta go. I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
Hello.
It's me.
Are you still in love with me?
I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
I'm sure.
You still together? Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Hello.
I can't talk right now.
Are you alright?
Pigsty.
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I'm sorry.
No, no. When are you going home?
Do you want me to be there?
Look, are you coming or not?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
You're soaking.
Mmnn.
Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
When are you going back?
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
Laura...
Let's go home. Okay?
C'mon. I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
It was like sex. What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
No, but...
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
WHAT?
Just local, of course.
You had no right. Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Barry said its done.
Barry? Barry knows about this?
That's okay. You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
I'm going to talk to you.
Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Would you marry me if I was?
No. Probably not.
Right. Okay, then. Shall we go?
Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Fair enough.
So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?
Shut up. I'm only trying to explain.
Rob here.
Hey. It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding. A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Enough, Liz.
Good. 'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly! Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
That way. You?
That way.
And so it is. I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Everything all right?
Great. Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
She left. She's gone.
What do you mean? Where did she go?
Hello? Anybody there?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say? Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
I must have nothing. Their my husband's.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
That wasn't part of the deal. I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Naw. Those are for us.
I think you have more.
Well we don't.
Records are those big round black things, right?
We're not there yet, Justin.
I'm Vince.
Nice.
How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Yeah.
Well, the cream of society awaits. If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
How's your uncle? I hardly ever see him anymore.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Would you remember his name?
This is against the rules.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Byzantine?
Basil the II.
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You have an active imagination.
I have friends.
Jesus Christ.
You'll be safe here. He won't kill in a church.
Why not?
Tradition.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
Who is he?
At the moment? Carl Smith.
What will you do now?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
That bothers you?
What about me?
Have you gone to the police?
No.
Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
He sees me as a threat.
No.
No one knows you're here?
No. I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Is this what you killed them with?
You've been listening to rumors.
What's all that?
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
Yes.
No. So what now? We just wait?
Yes.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
They do it each year.
Maybe it would do us both good.
It's beautiful.
I don't know any of these. I'll make a fool of myself.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
At least.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
A factor of age.
I hope I never get that old.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Yes.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
That's insane.
Perhaps. There is something more. An inheritance.
Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
It's all the same. Half lives that never go away.
What is it you want?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most. You should be back by nightfall.
Will I see you again?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Get out.
No!
The inheritance.
Life. It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Forget it.
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies. That's my right.
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What were you doing in Felton?
Research. If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
It's that important?
Who is it?
I don't believe him.
Why?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Be quiet.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Afternoon.
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist.
You're not from these parts.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I was nearly killed.
I did at that.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I was driven out.
How can you know this?
Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
You know me home. Me name.
You are the same?
Yes. Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me. Hear the words.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy. Accept it.
This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You will live. Survive.
Then they were right. I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Why?
Harder. Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Harder! You swing like an impotent cow!
Go to hell.
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift. One you must protect.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez. We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon? It is only a leaf.
Go ahead, Senor. I have my friend to keep me company.
I'm your future husband, remember?
I have no future husband.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
But I did live.
Some think not.
Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Leave me alone, Conor. Please.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Oh please. Another one.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
That's wonderful. Where did you ever learn it?
Far away.
David.
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
Tradition.
Romirez understood. Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Complete your inspection?
They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We need more time.
Eat up Dupont. It will probably be your last.
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Excuse me, "sir". I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
Wait. I think we understand each other.
It can be different. It must be.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You see Major? You are not so different...
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Must he go?
Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Where!
I don't know.
Smith. Carl Smith.
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him. He always does. Eventually.
He knows I'm here. How?
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
What are you doing here?
And have you something to settle with me?
Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos. Ever since I was a kid.
I knew his great-grandfather.
You're insane.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
You're wrong.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Of sorts.
Run!
You disappoint me. I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
This isn't done. Get up.
What's the point! You have me, finish it!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
And if I refuse?
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
Yes.
Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Did you know the victim?
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
My condolences.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
You're a kind man to be sure.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
You're one of William's kids, huh?
His only kid.
Sure take after him. Never seen a father and son look more alike.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Are you back?
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Who is it?
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Hello, Bensinger.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?
Seventy-five.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Too hot?
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Yes, wasn't it?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Mr. Burns --
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Yes!
Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.
Mother? But your mother --
No. My mother.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Anything the matter?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
You'll ask me to what?
Get out!
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. All right, boys. Take it.
Call Duffy!
No, you don't!
What's this?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Save that for the Tribune.
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
I notice you still remember it.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
What?!!
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
No!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Walter! D-did you see -- -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
We're going to take him over to my private office. Where's our phone?
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Hildy!
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
I'm finished.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What did you do with her?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Look at me, Hildy --
Hello -- hello...
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Ring that number, will you?
Will you come here?
Don't open that!
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute! Let go there!
Murder, uh?
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Don't tell me you were worried!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
How about Bruce's?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Anything you want, Boss.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Walter!
I'm busy, Duffy.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I think it is.
There's money in it, Cooley.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
How much?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let's see the money.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
Hey!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
What a chase!
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
Gus, this --
Same way you did. Through that gate.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Take your paws off me!
Let me go! Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
What do I know about Williams?
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What?
He's harmless.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Pete, you're through!
Fred!
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Pure politics!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --
Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
I did. Hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Who is this man?
That's a lie!!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
What did you do with her?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything! You keep away from me!
Phone for you, Hildy.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt.
Here!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Kings and sixes.
That's good.
Hiding him where?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
That man there!
A gun? Why -- to shoot, of course.
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
What good'll it do?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
They're not human!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's that?
Quiet, Mollie!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What do you want?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
Get the Governor on the phone!
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who? Me?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, I don't think so.
But how do I know...?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Look out!
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
The door was locked.
What's that?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Why?
This is going too far, young man.
But Grandpa, you said...
Give him the you-know-what.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
It's true.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Pauline's mum got killed.
No, she didn't.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
I know a secret.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
I did see them. I did.
You're the biggest fibber.
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
I'm starting my own collection.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well, for the baby, really.
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
What's that?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
They might be.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
What is it?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
How's your war, Mac?
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic! Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And absent bridegrooms!
No Turks.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
You joined up.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
That's it.
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
He always knows.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
And where do you think you're going?
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Is it peace in out time?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself. Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
He could always make me laugh.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
What did I do to deserve this?
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Where's that?
What about the tree?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
Hey, great they're back.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
You know... a couple of queers.
What the hell are you laughing about?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
He walks, duh.
Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore!
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, yeah... ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
How long have you been running this place?
The Duke?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about? A great American.
I don't drive cross country.
But if you did.
I don't.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
I'll help ya.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Thanks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
There's not enough room.
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What!
Forget it. I'll just go.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.
What are you doing!
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
Come on, get with the facts.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Fascinating.
That kid is one horny retard.
What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
How long is that gonna take?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Tickets for what?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
So.
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
When?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Thank you.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
What are you laughing at?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there... ...help, we're in here!
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Sleeping.
Rise and shine.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I resign.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Don't even say it.
You got to be fucking joking.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
What'd we here, Georgie?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Recover any bodies?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's the understatement of the year.
God damn.
You find something, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, right.
What do they call you, sweety?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
No, just a little too old.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.
Well hello, officer.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Thank you.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
Who's your Daddy!
Get in... now!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
Fit the profile?
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.
What about the body you found?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
Plates match.
I guess not.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Wydell.
Over.
That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And?
Tell him, Harold.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Hello, my little boy.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Say my name.
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Of course not.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Is everything fine?
Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
When you were a little French girl?
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
Yes. Happy happy.
I am sleepy.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
So soft. So smooth. I'm sorry. It's just...
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Fine.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Urgh.
Yeah? What?
Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.
Well?
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
No!
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
No.
My apologies, madam.
It's okay, Puff.
Very well.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
He's dead.
Progress!
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
So?
I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.
My brother says he likes you, too.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Done!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll be in touch.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Boy, this is good!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?
Yes, and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
Do you?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes.
Flares?
Absolutely.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
Did you see that?
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
I think he's feral.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
It's perfect!
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
All right.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
You are an animal.
So, how's it going today?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Yahoo!
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Interesting.
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Wait!
Mother?
Boys just passing through?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You want a chaser?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Check!
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
No, I'm fine.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
You know what's good for him?
To win.
For whom and for what?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
I'll make it up to you.
How?
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
We'll be there.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Cash.
How much do I owe you?
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
I lost twenty bucks.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Character.
I got drunk.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Thanks for the drink.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Hey, wait. What are you gonna do about the money?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I been thinking.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
How good is he?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Here, I got it.
Fine.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Sure.
How do we stand?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I wanna walk.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
Maybe. You want to play?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Well... well, now.
It's quiet.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
How much we got?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Eddie...
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Is this all we got left?
Hello, Charlie... C'mon in... That's my girl.
Hello, Eddie's girl... I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Talk to me, Charlie.
With what?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
HOW MUCH?!
Aw, Eddie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
Now and then. Why, do you?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
How much?
When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here. Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired. And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
How much you playin' for?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Try me.
Shoot.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
What?
How long have you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Have a nice trip?
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Cramped. You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm not.
So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What do you do on the other days?
I drink.
Hey!
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr...?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I could always get us a bottle.
No.
Why did you do that?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Why?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
Thanks.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Mm hmm.
What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Oh, cut my finger.
I've got something in my bag.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Haven't you opened it?
Do you want me to go?
You going out?
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Who is it?
What happened?
You wanna drink?
No. You?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?
I love you.
You glad?
Sherry. Very old, very dry.
Two. Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Well, what's so funny?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
What is it, Eddie?
Nothin'. Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
For how long?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty-seven.
Where's Bert?
Why?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
California. Oakland.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
That's right.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Your shot.
That's what the game's all about.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You -- think I am -- I'm -- -- an animal.
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
Are you all right?
Yes.
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where you lived?
It was warm. I was outside. The ocean?
What about... now?
With them?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?" Before?
Do you remember where it is?
What?
You want to find them.
Yes.
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
What do you want?
What do you mean?
We don't know that --
Mine.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
You have to go. He'll never stop. Leave this place. Find another.
Good evening. Did you have a pleasant day today?
Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister. They want to kill me.
That sounds charming. What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
You and that damned garden.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I surrender --
It's never gonna be done. You love puttering out there too much.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
Please.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
So, what do you do?
I'm am architect. I'm working on a site back in --
You built things.
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Wow. Look at the mountains.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
... and Rigel.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
I don't know, Dad. But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it. It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
What, Jim, what?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I know, Ellen. We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
What happened to you? Who was that?
That's Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
This is a new town for you. Do you like it here?
I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.
That's quite a story. You know that, don't you?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
Why?
Do you know how to follow a map?
Where, Jimmy?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I don't see anything.
I swear it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here. I'm going to make a phone call.
Who are you calling?
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
What is it?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Don't go in.
I'm not. They must be tunneling under the whole town.
You're looking for life?
Well, come on, you two. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Mom. I gotta talk to you.
What?
When?
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Oh?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
You're being paranoid.
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
Are you all right?
Did it work?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
We're losing them.
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
There's good news and bad news.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
Then what?
I'm thinking.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Three years.
Pops!
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You still got the Olds?
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Not listed, huh?
Spunky?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
Perfect, she's using it.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
Thanks, Pops.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Oh shit, we're late.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
But Mr. President...
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
How're we doing?
And our troops here?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Grey, you read me?
Where's it headed?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
That's impossible...
This is ridiculous.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
What?
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You're late.
You know me...
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Your son.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
We're already over Mach 2!
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
I don't need it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
But I gave you some this morning.
They let you out?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
How' he doing?
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
Why did you people come here?
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from? Where is your home?
Here... now.
And before here?
Peace? No peace.
What do you want us to do?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Run!
May we go home now, please?
Marcus! I did it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
All your life.
Your treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Ah, Venice...
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
That doesn't look much like a library.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
How's the head?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
What?
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way! Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
That was our assessment as well.
An old man's dream.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You could be more right than you know.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
DONOVAN!
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Bingo.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
It must be one of these...
What's that?
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
You said go between them!
My room!
Mine, too.
This.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
Oh, it breaks the heart.
And the head. You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Through the library?
Right.
Found it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
Well, uh...
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
Umh?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
I ought to tell you something.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What???
And the chair.
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
What?
Head for the fireplace!
This is intolerable!
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
What?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Brody's this way.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
What did you get?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble before God.
Penitent. Penitent...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
What did you find, Dad?
What did you find, Junior?
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
After you, Junior.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
That was seven hundred years ago.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where's my father?
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
All right! Where's my father
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Interested in local curios?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors. What was it they claimed was stolen?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
What's that?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
What does it mean, Indy?
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
What evil?
It is why Krishna brought you here.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
I'll take the extra ticket. Where's this plane going anyway?
Siam.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
India...
What'd he say?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
What?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
PET IT??!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
What about the future?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Any more complaints?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
Yeah -- and nothing else. That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Don't catch cold.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
What?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
What is it...?
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Give me your hat...
What for?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Don't do that.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
You're in my head...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
With a man in my head...
What was that?
You weren't listening!
No they won't.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
Anyone there?
Behind us?
What's that?
What'd he look like?
What do I do?
Outrun them.
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
JOE Or what?
They could put you back in the tube..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Find You?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
What is it?
What do we do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
What about money?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
...and a license to kill...
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
Now what?
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?
Holy shit!
What is it?
Do you notice anything.
Swim.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
What was?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
What?
...Joe.
What happened?
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
It worked.
Well you did it today.
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
What is it?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
What glasses.
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
What Happened?
I don't know!
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Is that all?
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
No. What will you do.
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
What?
He was with Gruner!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Probably.
I don't trust her.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
You sure this will work?
Not sure at all.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Left...The one with the red dot.
Well...?
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
And Dieter?
Do it.
I can't handle that thing.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Do something.
What exactly?
What happened?
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
Rene?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
What are you doing?
JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Sorry...
It'll remind me of you.
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What is your name?
No!
Oh, I can't.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
Nice?
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Rene?
Who's our little man?
Me.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
**?!!
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
He work for us?
What Job?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
I don't want to intrude.
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
And how do you service foreigners.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
Al?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
I noticed you staring.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Now you know what I know.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
...Blake
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Blake said that?
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
And you.
...right here too.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
What's so funny?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
And you?
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Promise you what?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
You know where he went?
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
What?
Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
That must be him. Water taxi.
Get us one.
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
What?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I asked him.
What?
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've been there?
I know the territory.
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Why not?
Can you?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
You can say that again. What do we do?
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Why did you, then?
How?
Now what?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Don't worry.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
He can't help us.
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
Come on.
That's twenty feet high.
Riuji?
What is it?
He wants to apologise.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
Excuse me?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
What about the others.
Is there anything else?
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Wait.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
It's alright.
It is?
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
This the only spare?
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
Where?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
What does that do?
What do you mean, what's it do?
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Alright, alright.
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not touching my film...
I'm afraid you are.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
Hi, baby.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Hello?
Okay. Lowell?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Lowell?
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Why? Who said?
...taping? What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
No classes this morning?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M." It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Alright?
Yeah, I'm here.
We're there.
You eating with us?
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Hardly new news.
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell!
What?
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
...but that's as far as I go...
Did work.
Did work.
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The new place? New.
...okay.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
What did you get us?
Next to your father?
You charge by the hour?
You believe that?
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
They do this with impunity!
Good. But Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You attract a crowd.
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What's changed?
You mean... since this morning?
No.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Did he hear you?
What about now?
What?
What's happening?!
I can't say that!
What are you talking about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Where you staying now?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Hello.
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Baby. You are so HOT!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
So she's uh, flourishing?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Is that... one person?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
You're in check.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
You have the pre-nup?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
It's your move, Miles.
My God.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
So who'd you hire?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
No.
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
Gotcha.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
But why him?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
Hello?
Miles?
Screw you, asswipe!
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No. Don't stop.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
We're damaged goods.
No.
Friends?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
What is it Miles?
I want to be your -- your wife.
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
I don't have a ring!
I know.
Oh Miles!
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Good. Are those foods?
Hi.
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Comfy!
What do you want?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
STUFF. Got a light?
Those are gifts.
Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's blackmail.
Hello?
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Please! Leave the house.
I fell in love Miles.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
She did a Harriman.
Wow.
Miles Massey.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
Who's she?
Maybe.
Well what does he want?
Lilly's up.
Every week --
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
What?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Wait. I know you.
Excuse me?
Herb wants to see me?
Mr. Massey --
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
That's delusional.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...arty farty!
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Thank you.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Mm.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
Wrigley!
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
What do you think?
What are they?
HA!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Wrigley?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Hi, Sweetie.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
OhMary
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What ten thousand?
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
You can't tempt me. Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
South America.
South America!
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ellie
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
On the road.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No.
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him. Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
It'll do no good. He despises me.
Ridiculous!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I don't know.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
No, I'll go through with it.
Is that his name?
Peter Warne!
Why? Do you know him?
Oh, nono.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
On a hunger strike, huh? When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
You talk as if
What would you like to have me do?
Yes, sir.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
We've done that already.
What happened?
What do they say?
They're practically all the same, sir.
Amateurs!
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Me? Forget it, son. I got millions.
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Whadda you want!
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
What do you think you're doing!
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Are you talking to me?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What am I going to do now?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, noI Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
I don't want it reported!
Oh, thank you. We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
Here, boy!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Of course I do. What do you mean
Beat it!
That's none of your business.
Now, just a minuteyou can't
Are you talking to me!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is colossal.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Here
What is it? Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage.
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere?
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Thank you. My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night. Said he didn't know we were married.
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Thanks, professor.
Detectives!
That's Father at work, What'll I do? Peter, what'll I do?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Well, you were!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Next week "East Lynne."
After that "The Three Musketeers." I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I refuse to resign!
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately. Ouch!
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Sorry. It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
That's silly.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
Peter
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter
What's got into you?
knowbut
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
Sure.
What?
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitch-hiking.
No. But I've got a penknife.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Carrots.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
What if nobody stops for us?
You're an expert, I suppose.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
What're you going to do?
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never! I'm going in and ask him
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Come onget in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on!
What'd you give him for the car?
Any luck?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested.
Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
What's the matter? Where's your husband, young lady
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But can't you wait until morning
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
SorryI didn't mean to
Get out!
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
What time is it?
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
What's up?
Yeah? Where?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Mr. Gordon
Huh?
Collect?
Yes.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Joe, listen
What's the thousand bucks for?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Huh?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah, where am I?
When you sober upcome in and see me.
ain't got a hat
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah?
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Send it collect.
Collect?
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Mebbe.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
Looks like it, don't it? Here's the woman, ma.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Zeke. Git!
Well, you're two up on me now.
Huh?
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
What's up?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What's on your mind?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Huh?
A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
Where do you live?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
There were no phone records.
Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand? Sure I know him. He comes around the Quarter.
What's the other name?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Did he pay you for this?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Go on, Willie.
Hold your horses. What kinda source?
Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
All right, all right. Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up? Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
I did.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...Oswald?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
You know damn well who it is.
Calm down, Dave, what?
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
...give me protection?
Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.
I'm sure you've seen this. Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Yeah, now that's true. I drove to Houston.
Why Galveston?
No particular reason. Just to go somewhere.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Why? What's wrong?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
And Shaw?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
No.
But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others. There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
That's something, Jasper. What is it?
Daddy! Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
...you heard echoes.
No. I had guns all my life. I used to go turtle shooting.
How many shots you say you heard?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I don't believe it!
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
No. Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
Who?
Let me show you his picture.
No. I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Hi.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Did they live?
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
Honey, some crackpot. Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Our home, Jim! A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Get a hold of yourself.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
They killed him, honey.
Huh?
For sexual purposes?
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
Remember whose office this was back in '63? 531 Lafayette Street.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Time?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
You know who the mayor was?
No.
Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.
Jim Garrison?
Yes.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
How much more?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
She's the best damn witness we have!
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you? Europe, Pacific?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
That's all you've had all this time?
Hello. Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then. How old are you?
Six.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Can I help you?
Not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.
Who?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Why were you with him?
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Can I have a word with you?
This is your money?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
What's this?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Fine.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
Can I see your I.D.?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
You gain weight?
You're not tired of it?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
This is pretty.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
It's different with men.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What about you Max?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Why?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
You do that?
That's my job.
And is that it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
In a dress.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Less ten percent.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I didn't use you, Max.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Wanna go?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Yes'm.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
We can look into that.
You know what we want.
Oh, so now you know him?
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
I'm recording this.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
You talk to him?
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
What about me?
What about you?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
You think I'm kidding?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
They asked.
And what was your answer?
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
Yeah?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
What do you think it is?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What the hell you doin'?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
Yeah.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
You told them that?
It's true, isn't it?
Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
But you don't?
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
Who?
Drink?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
Designer clothes.
Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Which one?
The roller disco one.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went?
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Please.
And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
What are you doin'?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Then what?
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
I didn't look like a bum.
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
Sure.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
It's Louis.
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
So what, you left her there.
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Jesus Christ.
What?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You gonna tell me who it was?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I'm going out for a few hours.
Hold on a minute. Where you going?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Watcha gonna see?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Gonna have to put up cash.
It's in my bag.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Getting there.
Beaumont Livingston.
Livingston, huh?
You don't say.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I need your name and address.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House or apartment?
House.
Hey, Max.
Comfortable?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Where is it?
I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.
That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
Uh-huh.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My office.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Uh-huh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
No.
You sure?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
Hello. Hey, Jackie... No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
No problem.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
He leave town?
He's around.
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home? This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
Remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Dream on!
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
No, thanks.
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
Della?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
How do you know?
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
You have an unusual hand.
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Hello.
That's right. We did.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe? What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Doctor. Ph.D.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I am.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
But the paper ...
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
What do you mean, demons?
How long had that been going on?
He say what they looked like?
No. Not really ...
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
... I've seen them, too.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
Who?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
I had this weird flash just then.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What? By myself?
What are you doing?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
It's good to see you.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No. I see them.
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I don't know what to say.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Whataya mean, no record?
What was that?
It's freezing.
It's not healthy with it closed.
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jacob, what can I do?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
You up?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Thanks. What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
I must have been out of my head.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Lemme see.
That's Sarah? I can see what you mean.
What?
Why you left.
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Ready?
Jake!
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
They weren't human!
You okay?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Coming here?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Help me! Help me!
Jake. You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I love you, Jez.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I want to know. You tell me!
Don't!
It might be for me.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh? Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
You come here often?
What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
Just relax.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I don't know what to say.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Please come quietly.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
I'll page him.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
I work in a bakery.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Count 'em on one hand.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
That black car?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Why not?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything. Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
Oh God. I know. I know.
I don't know. I don't know.
You come home with me.
Can I help you?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Do you want me to get someone?
I have some ice from the machine.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.
On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
He's not part of the program.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Okay, enough of this shit.
I don't have all day, kid.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Goodbye old friend.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What's that?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can we blow it with just two?
His mother?
What?
Minimal.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Bomb?
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
Uh-oh.
What?!
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Nice touch.
You see that?
Better let me.
Everyone okay?
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
We'd need charges.
How many?
Where is...?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Get them in the lab!
I am an expert!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
What the hell are you doing?
My job.
Wait a minute...I need...
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You just keep an eye out.
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
We need weapons.
Jesus, God!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Med-kit?
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
Hey.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
What's this?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
You?
Got it. You ever space walked?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Spunky . . .
Well?
She needs a little time.
That's really funny.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
Okay?!!
I'll help you in.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Push off toward us.
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
And what's with the headgear?
Now that's just gross.
Now this is getting exciting.
You must shut down the engines.
I'm missing two!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Later.
Jesus!
What are you doing?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
No... That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Am I in there?
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sorry, sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?
Do I have to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-Em we made it!
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
We're missing two of the kids!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
I don't understand...what does he want?
What?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
Damn! Close the door! I'll be right back.
What?!!
I gotta go back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'm sending you the files.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But...I...400 years?
Azrael can you repeat that?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?
What good will that do?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Guys, please come with me!
How do you open the damn door?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
What have you done?
Yes!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Can we get through these?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My boat's neat, dad!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
Did you bring a check?
What?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
This is Matt Hooper...
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
I never saw one that big.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
What's that one, there?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Where...?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Did you get him in the head?
What about us?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have you ever had one do this?
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Like you're from N'Yawk.
I never hear the whistle.
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
Love ya.
You're very tight, y'know? Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Only 24 hours!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Who's that young man?
She's right.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Got a pen on you?
My kids were on that beach...
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Dynamite! How was your day...?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
What stinks so bad?
What's that?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
...Nothing.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
Why don't we just tow it in?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Quint...?
What day is this?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Christine what?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
We're not even sure what it was.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You wanna call it a night after here?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Leg of lamb this time?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
One more after this, then I'm going home.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Look at him take it!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
He's busy.
Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Transplants?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Anti-Shark cage.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Let it go, don't waste your time.
I'm okay...
Over there!
What do you see?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Thanks for the message.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Cool.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole. So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm supposed to be running.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Charisma?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
Jesus, Bleek.
We could get back together too.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Um, hi?
We're getting a stretch limo.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're being really immature.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.
You know it's okay.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Wizard!
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Can we make out now?
Hey man.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
No... I guess not.
What is your job title, exactly?
Excuse me?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
What are you talking about?
Nails? Really?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
You don't know anything about me!
Wow, dream big!
Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
What? My eyes are not lying!
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
No.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Viscera?
Blood and guts.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I wrote that.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
What is it?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
You don't have to do that.
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
That suits you.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Consider it your musical education.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Cool.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
What?
I actually know this one.
Oh, okay. Like this.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
But you're old!
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
You should try Adderall.
I heard that was you.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Can I take your coats?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
What...
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
No...
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Elbow.
Juno? What's going on?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
What?
Hi Dad.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Yeah, she does.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Dad, no!
Please stop now.
What?!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Aw, please Junebug?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
You sound shocked or something.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Keith's hot.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
You don't say.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
You guys are playing music?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
Juno, what's the matter?
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
She answered our prayers.
What would be a good time for you?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Like what? Be a rock star?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
No.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
...Pardon?
...I said, I like your hair.
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
You dropped this.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
I'm cool.
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
That's me.
No it is not!
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
What?
Happy birthday Adele.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Shush, Adele.
Yeah but, what is it?
...thank you.
Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's your name, boy?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Where you from Walter?
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Tight fit.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
This the book your writing?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Who?
That bad?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
Ya see what I'm sayin'? Ha!
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
So tell me... what happened here?
...and?
You two been busy in here.
What happened to Adele?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
...I do.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
...and I think I know why.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
What did he sound like on the phone?
I like that.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
All set?
Fuck!
What is it?
What's that?
There's more...
Brian I want him out of our car!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
Early, just think...
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think...
You were plenty hot.
...You know what I mean?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
What happened?
Who are you?
Could be.
...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How old you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yes.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Yes!
Shit.
What do you think?
Well, how was it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You know what else?
What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
How?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Shit.
What do you want?
Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
You wanna go to Paul's house?
You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Telly.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
You thirsty?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Yep.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah. She's only 13.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
So really, it's good luck.
Good luck?
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Nah.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Na.
Man we fucked him up.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Sup then? Sup?
Sup. Sup.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
You were?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you like kissing me?
Uh huh.
Come on.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I'm nervous.
How do you know?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
But I'm scared Telly.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
I don't want you to hurt me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Do you care about me?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
No, Fidget, I...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No...
You know what I want to do?
Yeah.
What do I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why?
Because, you know why. You know.
Because your a virgin?
I wouldn't believe it?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Do you care about me?
Dance!
What?
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
One.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Your a real philosopher.
Hello.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Telly says was up.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You still mad at him?
The pain. The fucking pain!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Passion...
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Mine?
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah?
What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah I get bored.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
He still does.
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
Hi mom.
But then I won't need your money.
Mom.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Slow.
Yeah.
It was... it was.
What man? What is it?
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.
Casual.
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
You are! I don't like you.
That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that?
I wouldn't know.
That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
What do you want?
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
Yes you are.
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
The message! I figured out--
You want me to what?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Local?
What do you think?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy. Both of you.
No shit!
Sorry.
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
What is it?
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us! Where did you go!
We'll find the evidence.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
And -- what path is that?
Where is she?
You'll find her.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You know her?
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
I know what I said! She looks just like...
How?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
What?
What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
Hello.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Very good.
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
Hello, Peter.
You sonofabitch!
Emotional? I expected more from you.
By that time the game will be over.
Please... wait.
The game's over. You lost.
You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
I know where you are.
Very good. How did you know?
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it.
You don't understand.
Nope. Nothing.
There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston...
Never mind. He died two years ago.
1985. Hans Korshaud.
What is it?
What scars?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
I just can't believe it.
Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Come here.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
How do you know that? Did he say something?
Okay. Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Has he gotten through to any?
What is it, dad?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You ready?
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today.
It isn't Kathy.
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood?
What about prints?
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
That's great.
Same as the others?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
And this Jeremy--
But we heard him.
Anything else?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I know that. I've seen the photo's.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
What time did he get there?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
The most logical choice.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Ten days ago.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out.
You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help.
Another one? What word did he leave?
It's a commercial area. No one lives there.
Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Where were you last night?
Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell.
Did you send the car?
He knows you're aware of that.
Then I'll transpose.
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
You're always in the middle of a match.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
Mate in five.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
No.
Feel like practicing?
I can check and call you back.
Thank you. I'm at 639-7393.
Bainbridge Books.
Of course. Yes, here it is. Why, they're all the same?
What are they, please?
Sorry. I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel. I stay here every time I visit my parents.
How come you don't stay with them?
Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
When I was very young.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
Nothing. I just came in for a steam.
We need your help.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key. The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now. I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
You sound like my mother.
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
Of course.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
Of course.
Why?
No.
You're not?
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No. But I'm open to distractions.
You always want to talk about me. What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No. You were talking about chess.
Alright. What about me?
I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It's alright. It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about? You don't even know me.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm hungry.
Fine.
What do you want on it?
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Did you call?
They're not delivering. I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Peter...
For emphasis?
Exactly. It's the key.
What?
Hi.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
You're wife died. You can't feel responsible for that.
You don't understand.
Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
But I do.
Why?
This letter. I've never opened it.
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
It could be anything.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Frank told me.
You're right. The killer told me.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
You beat him.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm not nervous.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I lied.
About what?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I know it.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
Yes.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Lyssa ...
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
They have Lyssa!
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You have not slept in two days.
You choose these?
They know when they're going to die?
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
From here, I must go alone.
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
How did you know?
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
They can be saddled.
You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Am I not worth returning to?
Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
You will not, then?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
What business?
Once is enough, thank you.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
My <u>friend</u>.
You and I will guard the fire.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
When did you last sleep, boy?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
Well, I'm not impressed.
You've eaten nothing.
Hand over your dinner.
Go, join them.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Would you settle for a boar?
You!
What is that awful looking place?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
My heart stays here.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
I'm hungry.
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Would you desert your friends?
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Put me down, you lout!
You had better manners as a pig.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Food for crows.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Oh, my poor stew!
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
He will come for me.
Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is important to assure the succession.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
Modred! Impossible!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
It is the time.
Can you see?
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Kegan!
Who speaks that name!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
Do not try your trickery on me!
It is no trickery.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
I cannot stop the sand.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You will come with me.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
...What?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good... But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No, no.
Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
Rocket launcher.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
OK.
The yellow and pink.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
You were scared, weren't you?
Mathilda? May I come in?
May I go to the cinema?
No.
For musicals? That's part of the job!
Not taken.
Why?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...I'm going to kiss you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
What?
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK. I love you anyway.
Mathilda?!
What shall we do?
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
Poor darling, and then?
...Don't you drink?
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Mathilda, listen!
Yes?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby. I don't know any Danielle.
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh? That's smart!
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
You can't sit here like that.
...And how much is it?
...OK... Good.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
Messina.
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Yes... Twice.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Salute.
Do you recognize him?
He probably just went somewhere.
Where?
What is it?
This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams?
I have new dreams now.
I don't accept that.
It's impossible.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What if you don't make it?
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
What?
I have to finish first.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
Mine.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
Can it kill me?
So what's the deal Maurice?
Yes -- you are.
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
I've seen it before.
Okay.
Yes?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
Ellen?
What?
The new store?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
Yes.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
You're talking to me?
No.
Then why?
I do love you... very, very much.
Show me.
Walk with me?
You like to take walks?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I've changed my mind.
I want children.
You've just decided, is that right?
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Your father?
He's plastered.
I don't know.
I think it's a different place for each person.
I know where my heaven is.
Where?
Maurice?
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
To where?
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Why?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
That's a reasonable assumption.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts? About what?
What's his story?
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.
Red flags man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague? Why so evasive? He could be somebody hot.
Shit! He jumped!
Jumped where?
Well, hello.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
You tell stories?
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What was that?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
What are you saying? This story is too big for this paper?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett... Pride and Prejudice.
You're amazing.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
This is a ghost town. Nothing ever happens.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.
Where?
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
Walking where?
Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
She knew you loved her.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Why know?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
What Mr. Parker?
Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you Kris.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
Steph.
You're in pain.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What do you mean?
What's your shoe size?
Evening News?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
I really want that watch.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol?
What do you think I should get?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Hello!
Hello.
Are you working?
Sarah -- with an H?
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I guess I do too.
You what?
I sometimes fade out.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Do you want to fuck now?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
To death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
If I was I'm sorry.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
What's up?
This is the home of an angel.
You OK out there?
You OK?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Thank you. What time is it?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Me neither.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Hi!
Ben?
Why?
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
When?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Please!
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
There are limits.
I wanted to see you...
You know I love you... yeah?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
How much, do you think?
About ready for another drink?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
You have been lonely?
I've been all right.
You have been lonely?
Where have you been staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Where have you been?
Don't hit me.
Yes? What?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Go, Sera. Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yuri... are you...
Harvard Law School?
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
Were you with another man?
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Get up.
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.
Is he always such an ass?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
What's going on?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Where you got in the shower.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
How many, would you say?
Dewey Newcomb?
Who's askin'?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Did you get it?
Why the hell not?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
Is everything okay?
Thank you.
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
What did you see when you entered the house?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Was she carrying a weapon?
Why didn't you call me?
What?
I'm sorry?
Uh -- both?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
Yes?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I think so...
-- his life?
You can't even imagine.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
That's terrible!
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she?
You ready?
No.
God, that felt great!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
What's the point? Look at me.
Good one.
I'm so happy for you!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Really?
You almost had me fooled.
What?
I'm a bitch.
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Too demure?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Here. You're gonna need this.
Your scrunchie?
It's Elle! Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
You have Stromwell.
Neat.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Aside from that.
She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
But maybe it's not what you think.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
She's not!
And you know this for a fact?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
I can't.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Hey --
Whoa -- Why?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Someone missed you.
Is he the only one?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
No -- it's just -- not me.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Almost.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
What?
I got bangs!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
Why not?
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I did?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
It's pink.
Amazing how?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Maybe she found him like that.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Your what?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You're beautiful.
I completely agree.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
C'mon. Let me take you home.
No.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Good. Good.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Well, yeah, but --
You look -- nice.
Pink ones.
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Yes.
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Three months.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
She's naked.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Why do you say that?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Let's all go! Road trip!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
There he is!
Why so few?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Then we smash 'em?
You go? Not watch fun?
Fire moat... why do that?
What?
Dumb magic. Giant smash peewee.
Always.
We watch... good fun...
You go to lady now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
I like well what I see. It pleases me.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
And you... are you not also afraid?
I am afraid of nothing.
Like some vile toadstool.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
Damn you!
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What do you want from me?
Oh, yes...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
And then?
Yes?
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I see...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
You're a beast!
Might we watch, too?
And, now?
Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.
Or looked so beautiful...
What you do, boy? You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
I didn't know... I --
What? Speakee loud! No hear velly good.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Course not. I no flum here. I come flum Cathay.
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away. To the East, beyond the lising sun...
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Flozen foleva not good.
It's terrible.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Gump, is it?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Faerie ring?
No! Tis not the time! I want no part of your frolic.
No... I... I need to rest.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now? Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
And if I cannot?
It's bluebells!
What!
You be our guest, Jack.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You have me word, lad. To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.
Generally known! What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand. I am grateful for your hospitality and --
But... but, why?
Big question that, lad. Why what?
Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you know?
Will you lead me to her?
What do I do?
The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear? Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye. Black Baron's mischief.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Shhhh!
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
Damn them!
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Aye! That too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Fine-looking army.
Track the demon to his lair.
We must follow that bird.
Whatever for?
I'm sure. It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
This is ogre's magic.
Blackheart?
Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest. Mayhap I can cut them free.
Worse than the battlefield.
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Nice piece of work.
My God! Look!
Something the matter?
Shhh! Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
I should hope not!
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
Archers! Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
We'll find it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north. We continue in that direction.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Wait, Jack.
Hold, Jack! Don't strike!
Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Aye. We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already.
There aren't enough arrows.
There isn't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Will you chance a miss?
One more turn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye. We're good as inside.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense! Course it matters.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
The wound is mortal.
Nay. You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Sunlight, you say?
Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
Did you bring me here to sup?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
What weapon?
Sunlight.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Will you explain what's going on?
Can't we move any faster?
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Don't get too far!
He's getting away! He was at my mercy!
Never show mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
A good day for singing...
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I was with the Princess.
Where?
By the pond. She was teasing me.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
I'll try.
Keep me belly full, Jack. Kill us another worm.
Well done, lad. Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
You see! You see!
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Look at that shot! Three at once! I can't miss!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Aye... my Lord...
How're these?
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
You promised!
Never.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Blackheart. Aptly named.
Oh, fie. What about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
Let's rest a minute. I'm so thirsty.
Stop complaining.
A gentleman would offer water.
Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
I detest serpents.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
I'll go search for it.
Don't leave me now. I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'm not its master.
The napkin will keep. I'd rather not be alone.
How much longer?
Shhh!
I am a princess. You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one? It would thrill me so.
Are you honest?
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I've no fear of failure. Your implications are most unbecoming.
Where are you going?
What happened?
I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.
Who?
My father and the Baron.
They tricked you.
My own father...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.
He did run?
I don't want it on me.
Its powers are strong.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Tis the truth.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
My lady mocks me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?
Lili! No!
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
No! I won't let it happen...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No! Don't let go... you mustn't! I love you!
Oh! Green Jack! What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Lili... I love you!
What's the matter?
Ouch! Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching? Where?
Everywhere! Ow!
Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Step lively now!
Sigurd's sword...
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
A unicorn's been slain. The last stallion in all the country.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir! A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay. Tempting as your invitation be. Tell me one thing more.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
This is sad news, be it true.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You'll visit again?
Courage, Jack.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
You... you... you mortal you!
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Praise be to God.
Master Jack! Master Jack! These woods are alive! They're alive!
Where?
Up ahead!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Hello, Jack.
Sorry, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
How came you by this blade?
Uhm... fine work.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're with us in battle.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Is he a friend, then?
Lost?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Simple as that, eh?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
Marco!
What are you doing?
Dad's disappeared!
Are you going to see Sam again?
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I wanna be with you today.
Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
And video games after!
He's not there.
He's here. Check the bathroom.
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
Mom said I should.
Oh.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Red.
Mom?
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
What are you doing up so early?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Why? What do you mean?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He must.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
Alyssa.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Don't you have school?
What's today?
My keys.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
Did you feel anything?
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
What did you think it would be?
Hey.
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
You should stay.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
He's a freak.
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
Huh?
I can use your mom's.
Really?
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me.
Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What's the point of this?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
Not really.
You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
You hate your father.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
I don't wanna go.
He asked where you were! He wants you with him.
Where are you?!
Floating to Catalina.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Why is that?
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
He won't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
And of course the Beck's, with the...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens?
A violation?
Oh, yes.
And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
It's thirty feet.
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.
Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
Oh.
How old are you?
Forty.
Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I hate this job.
What are you talking about? You love your job.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
For everything.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Thank you.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Is Alyssa home?
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Sam?
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
Is Alyssa here?
It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
This has got to stop!
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
I forgot where I put my keys.
The whole summer, man. Party in Tahoe.
I'll ask.
I never said anything. I haven't done anything.
I know what the deal is. Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me!
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I warned you yesterday.
No.
I hate turkey.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
Why?
It bugs me.
I don't know.
I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd blame you. I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
I don't beg.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
Hi, Alyssa.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know. Why?
I know the feeling.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
That's not true.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I loved him too much.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
You look better than ever.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
She seemed upset.
Are you taking them still?
I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
And you told Mom today?
We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
You lied to me!
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Thanks for telling me.
Ah! Oh....
It's my day off. I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Oh. Sorry.
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
You should lock your doors.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
What are you doing?
He never answers.
I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead!
Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
What?
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days. I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Forget it, really. I'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
I don't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No. I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
It makes me sad.
What?
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I was here six years. And I only hated two.
Which?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What is it?
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
With your hands or your tongue?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Where's Sam?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Going on?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
I need to know.
Is your back still killing you?
No. Mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
What did he say?
Back. Neck. Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
It's just a joke. A stupid joke.
He said he heard hammering.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
His father is a man.
We've eaten.
Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
Should I?
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
After the kids are back in school.
I'm helping George build his house.
I can't go right now.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
Sam took them to a movie.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
No.
You don't look like you.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
Do you know anything about building a house?
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
What are you doing in my room?
I didn't go in your room.
There were no PG's. So I just gave them money to play games.
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why?
Queer.
What did you say?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
All day again?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
Nothing R, okay?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Nagger?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
But you can't.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
Yeah...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Sharp.
Yeah.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She's alright, isn't she?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Why not?
She got married last month.
Married?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Sure, boss.
I got it... boss.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Comfortable?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink? Two bourbons.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
You went to Monroe?
Here, this belongs to you. It was empty when I found it.
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
What?
Nothing.
No, tell me what's so funny.
A loan officer?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Oooh...
You're soft.
I said you're soft.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
So you made a generous contribution.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
He's dead.
It ain't here.
What ain't there?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Winston. His name's Winston.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
This fork is filthy.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
So?
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What's up, Ray?
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You drew this?!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Don't mention it.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
We'll just get off at the next stop.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
You get ketchup?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
You want to hit? Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Him?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Crawfords.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Let it go, Claude.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
That was five years ago.
What?!
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I'm not working on a plan.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
What the hell are you doing?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Go where, Ray?
Don't make me take them away from you.
You sure it was him?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
I can't eat this.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
So?
Yeah? You and what army?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
I know you're not talking to me...
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
What is that?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
All in, boss!
Move it out.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Where am I at, man?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Just like Elvis.
Mama?
Is everyone here?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Wait for the firemen!
It'll be too late.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
I prefer bourbon.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Something like that, yes.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Apparently, your sister died.
Jenny?
Appreciate it.
Who?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Understood.
ADRIAN!
You shouldn't have come here.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Let her go.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Is this a joke?
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
And he's dead serious.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
That's what I thought!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
We could create our own hell there.
...their damned souls will be ours.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
And give you a good buzz.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Urr... uggg... errr...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
I'll call her later.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
How come you're not older?
Where did you meet my father?
How did you see me?
Valerie's crying!
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Did you just talk?
Where is he? He's late.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
It's not me, moron.
Makin' friends already.
So far, so good. Now what?
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Release the evil?
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
This is baloney!
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
So go get 'em, Dad!
No. This can't be happening.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
You came through, Nicky.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Coulda been much worse.
Hey.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
What was it called, sir.
Boogerland!
Hey...
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
By she, do you mean he?
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
There's our man.
What's with that guy?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Should we wake him up?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Schnapps...
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
Yes, great movie...
Please. You got to.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Adrian?
You got the wrong window again, man.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
Really?
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
It's freezing my hands.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
You have a dog? What kind?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What was that?
Hey.
What were you thinking coming here?
Valerie?
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Do me.
I love you.
No.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Why is that funny?
I don't know.
It looks like the work of a brother...
A black guy?
That just hurt a lot.
Hey...
See something you like, my man?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right -- what are you?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you think we came from?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better. How do you want us?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
Your own work?
Just the face.
Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Had enough?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Why?
You missed something special.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Did you?
Of course.
I'm fine... See you...
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
What's wrong, Available?
No. Just no.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
Sad? What made you sad?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I thought I had to do something.
And?
I changed my mind.
And now?
Curious.
About what?
Let's have sex. I thought you were curious.
Not about that.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed. Well?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6?
What Quad do you live in?
K.
You could have called me yourself.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Maybe... sure...
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why show me?
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
Where did you get that?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't..
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
What're you going to do?
That's tomorrow.
I wish I could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something...
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
You're not going, are you?
I'd rather be with you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Uh-uh.
I have.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
I -- I can't.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
They won't believe us.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
How will they know we're coming?
Will you take me with you?
How do we know this is the right way?
I'm afraid.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
What's that?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't. We're going back.
To what?
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
And Sanctuary?
Beloved husband...
What does that water do?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Yes...
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
What belongs to the people?
All this. All of it.
What people?
We'll have to bury him.
What's that?
I'll make the arrangements.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
Hello.
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
No, no, no
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Are you ready to put him in?
Not yet.
We're leaving.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
More... many more.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I'm sorry.
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Well? How do you like it?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Listen.
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?
What?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
Why not?
Why not?
Very strange.
What is?
Do you own a video camera?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
As best we can.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
His or ours?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
I was here yesterday.
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I want more.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Hello.
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
Pete?
Me, too.
Hello.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
Have you partied with him?
You like it?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Yeah.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...
You liked it.
So, should I call Andy?
Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Okay...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Are you my man?
Yes.
You got him.
You all right?
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
Andy, who is that guy?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
I don't. I don't know him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Okay. Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
What night is that?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Hey.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
Please tell me.
The wife killer?
His condition? What do you mean?
His physical condition.
Have you made any charges against him?
No.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
I wouldn't know how.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
We know that.
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'll get a manual. and study it.
That's it.
There's no other bedroom?
What's your axe?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What is it?
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What are you going to do?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
What's that?
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I had a dream about you last night...
Yeah?
What's that? Another tape?
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
So?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
What?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Let's go home.
But...
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I told you to stay in the car!
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Give that a try.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
It'll be ready.
How ya doin', Pete?
What?
Hello.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
You're doin, okay? That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Yeah.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
We just killed a couple of people...
I missed you.
Yeah?...
What are you guys doin'?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
What do you want?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Why don't you like me?
Where'd you come from?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
Hey... Sheila.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Two years!?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
It certainly is.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Oh, really?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Where are they? Do you see them?
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
I'm thinking.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
No kidding?
Yes.
The police?
Yes.
Just call me Barney.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Yeah. You know.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
There you are!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Charming chap.
Well, that's that, I guess.
What are we going to do?
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
No.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
If you want me to!
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
You mean you don't want to go?
Well - I'm
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
And mine's Conway.
And the wine - excellent.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Oh, good heavens, no!
They were.
Well, it must have taken
Centuries.
buy and sell?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
108 and still active?
You're startled?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Charming, isn't she?
Yes, charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave it?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
What do you want?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors? That's fine. That's just fine.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
Are you the High Lama?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Yes.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Just what I needed too.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Yes, Bob.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Oh, stop it!
What are these people?
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
What is it?
See that spot?
What's it mean?
Hello, George. Cigarette?
Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean if we should get out?
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Nothing about the porters yet?
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Oh, George . . .
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
You can't take her away from here!
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Yes.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What was that?
was saying
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Good.
What if he refuses?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
What do you suggest?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
Was this your idea?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Yes, I know.
I'm thirty.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Bump?
Ouch!
Why?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I'd love it!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Go? Where?
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry. I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you! You will come today?
All right, I'll be there.
The hell happened?
Hesitated, sir.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.
So... this door. It's... not an exit... ?
...touch that.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir. I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
His physics are a little different than ours. Don't worry
It'll make sense later?
All the time, sir.
You do?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya? I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Helluva night, isn't it?
Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home.
We'll take it from here.
What? Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
What?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
Right.
It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I'm just saying it was cold. I think she kind of liked me.
You don't know the half of it.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha. No, really.
Well, one thing's for sure. You could certainly lighten up.
You don't know me at all.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
What?
I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Something's wrong here.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
Looks like a train ticket.
You think that's what's-happening?
Ernie Goose? Cynthia?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming? Where's he landing?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Oh, yeah? Fill us in, why don't you.
What if he's telling the truth?
Kay. All I'm saying--
I know what you're saying. And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Since how long?
Maybe they didn't get here. Maybe they've been here.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Do his job.
Wow... this one's cool. And it looks just like a shotgun.
Actually, it is a shotgun. Hold onto it--
in case I need it?
Do IT! SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Why not?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
When?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What do we do?
What do we do? Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
What are you doing?
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
No.
The kid looked desperate. I figured...
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Yes. Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Let's go, Jeebs. Downtown.
It's... coming.
So... now what? Cattle call again?
We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Nothing.
Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is. Zed, you in?
Yeah, Kay?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that? Kay?
This it?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Which way?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Kay? What's your 20?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia. I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Jesus, everyone's moving. Could be an assembly. Does it look aggressive?
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
They went right to the President.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
How'd you know?
Wally!
Is it now?
What?
What?
They're inside.
Take it.
Agatha --
Can you see the balloon man?
Drop some money.
Forget that guy --
No. Follow him.
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
He's here.
I can't. I have to know.
Oh, God...
Anderton --
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Why?
The other two will die without me.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
She died?
She grew up.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
What --
-- but he didn't.
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Found? Where?
Think, John. Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...
About who?
Yeah --
And replace them with new ones.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
We know each other?
From where? D.C.?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
You the sentry?
No, you're not in trouble. I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
That's an old one. One of our first.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
You the only sentry?
Hence the expression...
... Graveyard shift.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Tell me not to worry, John.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Uh-huh...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Lamar, I'm sorry. I don't know what --
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
I understand. What's the other thing?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
What?
She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house. We'll talk --
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
John. Please. Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
People want to believe in the system. That's the beauty of it...
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
Seventeen minutes.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here. We never touch anything.
Don't run, Chief. You know we'll catch you. You trained us.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We can't grab it...
Somewhere near the capital?
No maglev system.
The mall?
Yeah? So?
Go ahead.
Did he close the front door?
What?
Uh-huh. Jad?
Sir?
Jad. How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Red Ball?
Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Confirm with trig and image.
Sure, Chief. I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.
Why did you catch that?
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
Yes.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
To them.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Really? You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question. You don't have any.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
You set me up...
It seems I've found a flaw, John You.
You gonna tell on me?
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
Wally, listen to me...
Just go to the beginning!
I need help with her.
Rufus. She's a precog.
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So?
They don't belong to anybody.
Stop --
What happened? Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
I won!
Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.
Come on!
Sean -- you're not real.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
You're alive?
No. He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Sean --
I feel bad about that. I need you to forgive me.
I forgive you.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you...
I wanted to.
Who are you?
I'm your son. I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Do you know who I am?
Some -- somebody's father?
It floated back up. I had to take him out and --
You're not gonna kill me?
But you have to. They said you would.
The precogs were wrong.
You're supposed to kill me. He said you would.
Crow. I'm not gonna kill you.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Let go of the gun.
You're not gonna kill me...
Something wrong?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
You don't seem all that proud.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
What safe place is that?
Where?
If... you have one.
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
John?
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing. I didn't kill him.
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
Who?
Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.
We know why John was tagged.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
How did you get this?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
Good God. What was that?
It's the same prevision.
I don't understand --
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
So there is a way to fool the system?
Shhh. You know what I hear?
I wanna kill my boss.
Uh-huh. Okay. You got some images I can work with?
Right here.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
Don't worry. I'll bring him in unharmed.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that. I'm taking control of the team.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
There's thousands of units like this one.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
It doesn't matter. He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
There a maid in this hotel?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
How many?
He looks familiar.
Who?
The man across the street. I've seen him before...
What about your meeting?
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
Howard --
My name is Danny Witwer. I'm --
This your work?
I like it.
Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream. Sorry.
Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any sugar either.
Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that.
You know I need to use you.
To what? Trap him?
To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Shhh! They're sleeping.
They've never been separated before.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
You're Bobby, right?
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
We have snifters
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
It's on West Broadway.
So, wait, you're from where?
Manhattan.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
We're in Fashion.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Holy shit.
Is he cute?
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
I know.
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
What the fuck was that about?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Bullshit.
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.
No.
What's wrong, baby?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
You're not my daddy.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hello.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I don't know.
Mommy's not home?
No.
What time is it there?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh my god. What happened?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Oh, please.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You talk to Max today?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
No coke tonight. Right?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Yeah? You sure?
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I'll support you.
With what?
I never promised you anything.
How could you let her see this?
Take her.
What'd you say?
Whu --
There's no touching.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I -- I -- I... Don't...
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
Draw.
What's your record at?
5-5-1.
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
Yeah.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Get away from her.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
He making the drop?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
No.
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
That it?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I know.
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah. Sure.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Yes.
What is it?
You want --
There won't be a next thing.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
What's the plan?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
What's that?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah?
Understand me?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I'm on the phone.
It's important.
So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
Ruiz isn't here.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What about it?
So?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I know the number.
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Fuck them.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
You wanna go right now?
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Fuck him.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
What? Did she say something?
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
Right here's fine.
Is that the woman from..?
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Pretty nice.
What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
You sure?
Who you calling?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You know this guy?
I don't know.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
What did I 'get?'
Yeah. What vibe?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah.
You happy?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where do you think you're going?
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the hell did you do?
What the fuck was that about?
What's up?
He wants to see us now.
Where?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
We're not getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
What are you doing.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Put that shit out...
C'mon, man...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
All the more reason.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
Calm down.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
I'm sorry...
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Kinda. Yeah.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man. Hey, bro.
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
He's on the list.
What's up, man.
S'up.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yes?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
The videos.
Yes?
Drinks are free, right?
Yes. Would you care for another one?
Yes.
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where's Spa.
You strapped?
'Strapped?'
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
You really in trouble?
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Ow, shit...
And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Good morning.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Ricky.
Is it nice?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're square.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Thanks.
Can I borrow a piece of --
We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
What?
I get it.
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
But, Max --
We're square.
No. I'll take a strega.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
Scotland.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I am.
I'll get it.
What they call you?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
Heard where?
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Man's rep travels.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Is your papa West Indian?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Where can I get a hold of you?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Did you just now con me?
Yes, sir.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
When?
What?
How's it feel?
Solid, daddy.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
I'm working on it.
It hit?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1. I git 'em all?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You never had it.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You're a damn liar.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
Take it easy, baby.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
What you say?
Who the hell are you?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
What for?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
What the hell for, man?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Tell Him that.
Do you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Is the program ready?
No, Brother Minister.
Next week, Brother Minister.
What?
What points?
Could we sit down someplace?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about you for a change.
There's nothing to talk about.
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
I'm in Detroit.
I know.
At a gas station. Will you marry me?
Yes.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes. Did you eat?
It won't be easy.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you're in trouble.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I'm not made of glass.
Talk about what?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Dear heart, I love you.
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I'm tired of praying.
Brother Earl.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let some of us come down there.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I assumed...
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
That's right.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Just what are you saying?
Please, go ahead.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
What?
"His greatest greatness."
Say what you're saying.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
I say a lot of things.
You know that gal?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
She know?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Murder.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Get out.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Did you hear me?!
How many you turning out?
500.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Another one?
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
That's a fine chick.
Fine as May wine.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
That ain't bad.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
So what about him?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
You want to be the head man?
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Who the hell are they?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Watch your tongue, boy.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
He's bright.
They talked about me like
Am I a suspect?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Creasy... I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you coming from?]
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
So what do I get in return?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Where do I find you?
I show, you give me the information?
Deal.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Si.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[What is his name?]
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The what?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Drive.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who are you?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Who's he?]
Who's he?
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[How much do you want?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Yeah. Yes.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[What do you mean?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Please, don't...]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[And?]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Were you provided with a gun?
Yes.
What is it?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Is it loaded?
I drink.
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So what's wrong?
Nothing wrong.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Yeah, right...
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You been working?
You did something on impulse?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
You mean a misfire?
Creasy?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Pinta...
Yes or no?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
I'm a bargain.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
No.
Hmmm?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
What are you doing?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
No.
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
Where?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Do you always sleep with him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Did you sleep alright?
Yes.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I don't understand.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
No.
Did you used to?
You're late.
I'm sorry.
Where's my mother?
I dropped her at home.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Your father has business.
The blocks.
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
You think too much?
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Then be trained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You got that right.
The world of our children. How dare they?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
You're American.
You've done much of this work before?
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It makes it all seem so serious.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Sorry.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[You have the money.]
[Yes.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[No. Why?]
You should be sleeping, baby.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
You do?
Bye, Mom.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
I think it's fantastic.
She likes him.
Hmm?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go, Samuel.
What? Who?
Creasy.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
That's ridiculous.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
Hey, Herbie...
What?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Which one was that?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Waddaya gonna do now?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
You want me to ride down with you?

It's early.
It must be one o'clock.
All right, I'll see you!
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
We just talked.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who told you that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I feel fine.
Oh.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You told me.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What happen?
Ah?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?

You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Wadda you think?
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Marty...
No...
Please...
No...
Please...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Nothing.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Where you going now?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.

Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
That's the one.
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Don't worry about it.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
What?
It's loaded with what?
Tomatoes.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Marty...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Marty...
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
What, Ma?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't like her.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
Hey, Ang'...
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...

So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...

You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Stop him! Stop that man!
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Miss you, Walt.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Look at that right eye.
Epidural hematoma?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Y'all mind the store.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
Thou. For Thou art with me. Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What the hell's going on here?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
What's that?
The chest-cutter.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Never mind. Forget it.
When will he be able to write?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Never heard of him.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I have a tent to myself.
People will talk.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
It's supper time. But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Frank...
Wait a second...
Is that liquor?
Give us this day our daily...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
I was just asking...
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
You betcher ass, Dad.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
What for?
C-A-M-E-M...?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere. Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
Very well, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
What do we do?
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
All of them?
That's right. We work well together.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
The bastards outconned us.
I think we could still have a chance.
See you.
It's possible
Thank you, Captain Pierce. It's been so long.
No trouble at all. Hawkeye.
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Of course not.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Even if I weren't.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship. Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're asking for somebody else?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
You think he won't.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Second pint.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
I didn't have much choice.
You really say the cutest things.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
He's coming to.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
No, never in the slightest.
Just in dreams?
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
The blonde dish.
If you mean... She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
About that chest-cutter...
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
O'Reilly!
Yes, sir?
O'Reilly, what is it? There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Damn.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
What's that, Henry?
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Captain... 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
How is he?
Nice.
Nice.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Huh?
Are you all right?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Here. Sit down! Quiet, egghead! All right, now, a serious expression.
With all of it?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yeah. No, no! No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
No.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Who?
Who?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh . . .
Me?
Can I help you pack?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
About me?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Ted Sheldon.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Did you write this?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Yes, sir.
How much money do you get?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Thank you very much for everything.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh!
A third party?
Hello?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
That's your father's diary, Ann.
What's that?
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert to What!
Say that again.
You made it up.
In what man!
John Doe.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Well, you're catching on.
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
I can read. I can read!
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Looks all right
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
That's our man. He's made to order.
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
Yes. What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Okay, fellows.
What's the idea?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Colonel!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Has he been here?
No.
Have you seen him?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Where's Connell?
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
Yeah, a little.
What do you do when you work?
I used to pitch.
Baseball?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Go out and find her!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What?
What do they want?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Both of 'em?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Help yourself.
Who's got him?
The heelots!
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
The heelots!
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Ba-ll!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
How could he be a fake?
It must be some kind of a gag.
A what?
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Join the John Doe Club.
I trust him.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I don't get it.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
How about family? Got any family?
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
What's your name?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
Did you write itor didn't you?
It's good to see you. Sit down.
It's for Ann . . .
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Flowers.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Oh!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
That's too bad.
What do you mean, too bad?
I know one way you can do it.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
What?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Is there a crowd in the street?
No, sir.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Hello, guys.
They're not usually graduate students.
SWAT wants to go in.
I don't know.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
No shit! He's good!
Where's the stereo?
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Apartment 306.
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Who is it?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Could I please have a little water?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
What happened, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I hate fucking Springfield.
Where's the car?
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Really?
Am I gettin' the car?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Automatic.
Who are you again?
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
I what?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Hi, Roper.
...a car.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Anything on Korda so far?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Are you in charge, Roper?
Is that all?
You can't kill me like this.
Open your shirt.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Satisfied?
It's all there.
Yeah.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
It rarely has to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
Is there something wrong with that?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Explain how that works.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
We see each other every couple of months.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Where did you hear that?
I think I can handle that one.
You think you can learn, McCall?
No.
I can't do that.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
Why?
To save lives.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
You know why I like the track?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
Still needs work.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
They need to run first and second?
COME ON RUSSELL!... Who the fuck's Russell?!
The jockey!
We won!
We lost.
We won.
How much you wanna bet?
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
So what do you want to do?
McCall, you all right?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.
I know how you feel, Ray.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
I worship you.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That a new picture?
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
What do you want from me?
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's already started.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What do you think?
Yeah that's it.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
You like this place?
Yeah?
Korda escaped.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie, Scottie...
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Scott...
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
Repoed this morning.
I can't do that.
Who's running it?
Roper...
Who's running it!
What have you promised them?
Are these yours?
Yeah, they are but...
This is Halden.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you need?
There are two million people in there with you.
Yes.
They have nothing to do with this --
God-Damn you!
Yes, I believe he has --
System's running on auxiliary. Only seven hours before it crashes.
True.
You're in there. Everybody dies, you go with them --
It's okay.
Okay...
Why?
She said I have a son...
How come I can't remember?
Because I took it out of your memory.
Why --
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question. You a strange man?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
This is how you pick up women --
Do you believe in miracles?
You were right.
Who are you?!
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
It's all here...
The guests are here.
Guests?
But this is impossible.
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
Wake up?!
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
No.
But what would happen to me? I have no body to return to.
Not my problem.
Divinity?
Yes.
You are not a God.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God. End into beginning.
In a computer program.
The new world.
It's not real.
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system. When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Dream?!
Unlimited energy out there. Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed. Everybody dies.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Where the hell are you going?
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
You sure he's going to come?
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
The maze has been changed --
Where you plugged-in from?
New York.
What?
What's her name?
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
Take care.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Won't be time if he gets access --
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
You're jumping to conclusions.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
One condition.
What?
What is it?
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
A hotel?
Why?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
That's right.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Who did he digitize?
Listen to yourself. Digitization. You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
What did he tell you?
The truth.
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
We drugged her. So she wouldn't remember.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
An interface attendant.
Where?
Need the disk back!
Insurance.
Insurance?
What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.
I've got to get back.
Someone you have to get back to?
You went to my high-school?
No.
Then how do you know about --
-- You told me.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
-- The inside?
Identical. One's you. One's digital.
That's not possible. No one can do that.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Yes.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
It was a test.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Realize?
And it meant something.
What?
I wasn't with you.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you. A copy.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?!
What's so funny?
This. No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
It was just there.
There?
My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.
Just like that?

Program name?

Be the eagle. Be the eagle.
Here you go! No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
... A falcon?
And how do we release the power?
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Simon says...
What!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
"Basically".
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How'd you know?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
That was a CHEAP shot!
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I am the mighty ape!
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
And I ain't no nigger either!
You own a hotel, sir?
You've got the public upset, Al.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Awwh, Charlie.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
The goddamned bastards.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Poor, yeah.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Boo-Boo.
Up here, Boss.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
You scare me, Charlie.
Are you frightened?
I had everything. Once.
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
I got my partner in there!
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
We could lose the deal!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Well...
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Inside, they were talking of you.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
I'm already late.
Luciano.
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
You could have stopped him.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
I booked passage to London.
London?
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
You fellas got names?
Meyer just finished the books.
We'll figure out something.
Meyer.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
No. We ain't even...
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I been thinkin'...
Like a party for all our friends.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Who?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I'm glad ya come.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Where we headed?
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
What are ya thinkin'?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The kid just called me stupid.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I must know more of you, my son.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
He's an animal!
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I don't fuck my partners.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Forget it. That's past.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Masseria's been after me too.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We can operate around these guys.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Strategy.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
And what do you want out of this?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Jesus.
Forget it.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Yes?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Luciano is dead?
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
That a Jew compliment?
Take any one ya like.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
You're fuckin' crazy.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Special occasion?
Who did this?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Switch hands.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Death! Thank you!
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
At the moment, yes.
What's the matter?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Tell me what?
Land of Death. How do I get there?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Bitchin' good cake.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Got a doctor on duty.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Who?
What's the "bad" part?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I don't think so.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
The ring...
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't ask where I got it.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
All right. You can come.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...LOOK!
What?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened? Did you lose your keys?
We like to think so, yeah.
Who told you we deal drugs?
Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?
So, what do you think?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I wanted to ask you something. Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
Dating anyone?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
What pictures?
You know ... ... whoops!
Mother!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Behind the books.
But I was dusting.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
Don, this is my mother. Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Mother!
Mm hmm.
Who is it?
It's Marika. Is Paula there?
She's at work. I'm her mother.
I'm sorry. I had a wretched night.
Really?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
What happened?
What does he do?
Where to?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ...
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from?
Moscow.
Ohhh. Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
This is one-way street. You go down the block to the middle.
This way?
I see. How much?
Forty-five all total.
Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
Never.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Tell me why!
Would you settle for a husband?
What's this, Diz?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You got worms.
What! Who?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Yeah. What about the second act?
What dame?
Paine.
Why do I always laugh at that?
"There's more light here," he says--
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
My friends?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Shut up, Diz.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Again? Good idea.
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
Tunnel?
Have *you*?
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
The war's on!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
That infernal phone!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Taylor, my dear.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
How do you feel, champ?
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
One minute! Just one minute!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Henry Hill.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
*You won't?*
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Y-yes, Jim.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
The--head?
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Washington!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Where were you?
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Nonsense, Jeff.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Here--where are you running off to?
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Gosh! Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Well--goodnight.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Please, sir!--come with me!
No, Jeff--please--!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some-- Governor Hopper!
Oh, now--
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Now, Amos, now-- What?
Hello, Jefferson.
Hello, Ma. Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
Can't you?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
What is it?
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
What's your name?
There *what* was?
Whose statue is that?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
With or without 'em. Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go ahead--punch.
Punch?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Oh, but this one is so simple.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, just a day--
A *day*!
Committee, huh?
Committee.
Yes, I see that.
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
What?
The Steering Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
*This* is.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Pardon?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Thanks very much.
Try sitting down.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
He did?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Yes, yes--
You mean--here?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No complaints.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Go right ahead.
Saunders. That's better. Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
I know. It's--Violet.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh. Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
In Terry Canyon?
You--don't know it, do you?
No--
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Second drawer.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Thanks a lot.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Don't mention it--
Hello.
What are you going to do?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Wait--
What you *have* to do is fight!
Yay!
Hurray!
Where do we go from here?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Sure.
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again. Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What! Who?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Let's get away from here.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Go away, Nosey.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
You want to see me, Senator?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Yeah? And what else?
Yes--
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
That's him. Let him in.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Jim!
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
How nice.
His first 'whiff'!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Father--oh.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection? You may proceed, Senator.
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
That's going to be fun.
Put that away, slug! At your service!
Good morning.
Deeds?
Yes.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Most every day.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
No.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Sure. I met you.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What are they going to do?
Have you seen the papers?
Yes.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Here's a nice place.
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again. Good night.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Hello, Mary?
What's the matter, hon?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Uh-huh.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Yeah, then what?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
With pay! She is out the door.
What's bothering you, huh?
Last night he proposed to me.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
What're you going to do?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Come on, come on!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Boy, was he burning.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
John
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Yes, but you said
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Stuff, sir?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Sit over there, will you?
Me sir?
How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Thank heaven.
Come on, John. What happened?
Relatives of old man Semple.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
Miss Bennett please!
He's what?
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
But your honor
Newspaperman?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
That's pretty.
I can't find him.
You can't?
Look!
What?
Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it. And, Charlie
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
What for?
You're going to New York with us.
Will you have a cigar?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
Yes. That is to say
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Nah.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
We provide opera.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Me?!
Naturally.
Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Uh-huh.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Mrs. Semple?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Well, I don't know. I
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
No.
Look, he's temperamental.
Your Honor
Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Who are they?
Don't pay any attention to her.
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
You mean by the neck or something?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What do you think you're doing?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
You came home last night - without them.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Please!
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
But she's on the telephone
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Shall I call the police, sir?
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Really? You think so?
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
One hundred books?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
Mr. Cook.
Uh-huh.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Why's that?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Were you supposed to have a session?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
What an asshole!
Ernest, what do you think?
...And I from Phyllis.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
What are you doing for lunch?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
I have eighteen more minutes!
I don't want to hear any more today.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What?
Stop now.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
No?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Where's your wife, Henry?
Go to hell.
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Oh?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
What do you want to know?
How long you been in this town?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You like me. How come?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
And the Brocketts?
Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
Doc...
Lily.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
But you know how to drive?
Sure.
Got a license? But no car?
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
Martin.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What'd you want?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
What?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No.
Hmm.
What would you do?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Mom's such a cutie.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Please... forgive me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
No.
Is this the treatment?
Sorry... I'm done.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Where?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
You're doing great.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Yes.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Disgusting.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And he's where?
You like it?
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
What was that?
Transference!
Hello?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
...How violated I feel?
I am irate!
But...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What?
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Anything... just ask.
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's called pro bono.
Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus.
You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
Nah... scotch.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I understand.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I've got three big ones.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
This is great!
This is exactly what I wanted.
Okay then. Have you got a lot of friends?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Amazing.
Unbelievable... ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Hey, Skip.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Guess. Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
How's it coming?
You don't think I'm insane?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Really?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Who'd you go with? That's not good.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
What about it?
And a birth certificate is enough?
No... no training.
Psych major?
English Lit.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily.
Sorry...
I guess that makes sense.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
When?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
That was a terrible thing.
Relax, I got him.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And what ritual would that be?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Now go find me a big stick.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
None of the above, thank you.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Goin' somewhere?
C'mon, friend.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Where's your new friend?
Immune from what?
You shall see.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
What is he doing here?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what did he say?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
You lie.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Fifty percent.
Twenty.
A bright good morning to all.
What are you doing here?
So who's the broad?
No.
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
You know your history.
Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here.
Can you swim?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
We're almost there.
For what?
That "thing" gets me excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
How?
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
Is he supposed to look like that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
I'm staying.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You called me your girl?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I think you were jealous
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Jonathan?
Yes?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
I was mistaken.
You lied to me!
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
What do you suppose killed him?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Juicy?
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
She's my sister, actually.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
None taken.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Tough break.
Where's my gun?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Who's here!?
That looked rather painful.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Really?
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
So who killed him?
We didn't think this through very well.
He was the last time I saw him.
When was that?
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Who are you?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
He was cute though.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
But you're a superhero.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Me, too.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
What did he mean?
Mon Captain, it's for you.
Hey... you okay?
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
Ummm.
I got it.
Superheroes.
Should I kill them?
That boy's got talent.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
You're nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
You're dead.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
Really?
Sure -- I guess.
Hi.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
I'd better go.
You're a spy.
What?
I saw him walk you home.
Who?
Stay away!
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Or talk?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Date?
Yeah.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Sure.
I admire you.
Why?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
Roy.
It's home.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
And what if you get killed?
What?
Bye.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You're the Sphinx.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
You drink too much.
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
Oh don't start that again --
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
What are you talking about?
And it would be the right thing to do.
Have you ever seen him?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
But there's still only six of us.
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Cover me!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So why don't you just tell her!
I can't.
Why not?
Nah.
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Let's go.
I'm soaked. Oh great.
Maybe she's right.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy --
So where's the art?
What's that?
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Wow.
So what can I get you?
Here you go.
Ow.
Jeffrey!
Oh hi, Mom.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It's on the television.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
It is?
I always knew that you were special.
You did?
Hi.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
Sorry.
Be a Mohican.
And there's the Sphinx.
The who?
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
It's time.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
Through there!
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Please...
Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
What do you have in mind?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Are you serious?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
About 5,000 troops.
Cavalry?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I'm not insulted.
You realize what is at stake?
Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Paris has surrendered?! I don't believe it.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know, sire.
And where is Joseph?
Who is there?
Bertrand, sire.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
General Bonaparte?
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Thank you, sir. I will do that.
Yes, sir?
Oh -- where do you come from?
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
I haven't been there for three years.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
No, they're living in Nice now.
That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah-hh, no.
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
My God...! What time is it?
Four o'clock.
When did it start?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?
I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?
And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Does your mother know you have come?
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Yes, I am, sir.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
That's a very nice name. Where are you from?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
No...
No... nothing at all.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
You must not act impetuously.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
Will you use the troops?
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Were you in love with him?
I thought I was. I was confused.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
No.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Of course.
Were you in love with any of them?
No.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
Promise me you will never leave me.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
I will never forgive you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
I don't understand you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door. It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Will you be joining us, soon?
I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
Yes.
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I believe you sent for me.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Why not?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
Nothing. That's all I can say.
That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Yes.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
You could hear them?
You mean you heard them making love?
Can you give me a drink, please?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Oh, then you are...
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
Does she deserve anything better?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
That is correct.
And where do you place Alexander?
What did you say his name was?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Come in.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Come in.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig. Hook us up.
That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Yeah.
Well, let me in.
Y'all never use it?
That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know!
No. Thought he was with you.
Me, too. You think they're in there?
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Yes you did.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Where you going?
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.
For sure. That's how I like 'em.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Naw, I already ate.
Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that?
Me neither.
It's about to work, just come on.
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up! Now who sent you?
Nobody!
What's crackin'?
This you?
Man, this a cool house.
Go on and make yourself at home. I'mma go get dressed for work.
I can't see! I can't see! Daddy!
She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me!
You straight?
Just a little.
I can't taste nothing.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Who is that?
That's the sister.
Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
So.
I walked.
You walked?
You know what this is?
How can they do this?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
$247.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
You better stop running from that girl.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Blow.
It works.
This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What we gonna do?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
Yeah, air.
Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
What's the B-G's?
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait.
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous. make sure you get that car fixed.
I will. When can I come visit?
Karla.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
You want us to give you a ride?
I don't know.
Hello, remember me?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning. They're assholes.
It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys.
Most definitely.
Huh?
What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
You did all this for me?
I did. Is that door locked?
It's locked.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Delivery!
Delivery!
I said hold on!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Here I come!
What's the matter?
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I do.
What it smell like?
I gotta get'em fixed. They don't roll down.
All damn.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Craig, remember what I told you.
You see that?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
You too.
Smokin' what?
Excuse me?
What kind of activity?
Nice to meet you?
Why for? Them boys are real player haters.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Did you see that? That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
What it say?
What is it?
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Today ain't my day.
I do.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I didn't even pass it.
Roach, what are you doing?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I'm not letting nothing go. They killed my board.
Try an' hold it, man. Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Hey.
What?! What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Call me.
Wet your eyes, boy. Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
Ah damn. Damn.
I got fired too.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
I know. I'm sorry.
Where's Craig?
What the fuck you looking at?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
What?! This look like a 7-11 or something? Get the fuck outta here!
Shut up! Both of you right now!
Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up.
Why would he take it? He don't even know you.
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Get on.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Just do it.
You too big.
Debo! Debo!
What?
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Ezal! Ezal!
Huh?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing. What you want?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.
'Take your car?'
I got your message. Where's Craig?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro. You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
What's the matter?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Okay, okay, that's enough. Go put on some damn clothes.
Elroy.
Suga. Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Huh?
What you doing to my nephew?
Mr. Nasty time?
Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl.
Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
What happened here?
All right, I'll do it.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Where'd you come from?
Sorry.
'S okay. What do you think?
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Somebody close?
What?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I need your help.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying? Your daughter....?
I...
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
How do you know that?
You shot her?
No.
What?
And your husband works for somebody else.
This? I've never even fired one.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Can we go now?
Good luck.
Could I see some identification, sir?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Come with us, sir.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Daddy?
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes, yes, I understand.
Yes, I'm listening.
You're out of your mind.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
This says "invitation only".
This'11 get you in anywhere. Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What would you do in my place?
What...?
Tell me why I miss him.
He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
I killed you.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
How am I supposed to get away?
Come back.
Again.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Let me talk to her again.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
Is that something precious?
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
But...
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
On TV.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No way.
Ready?
Nods.
Lynn!
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Can we go now?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
Will you promise me that?
I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
Oh, man...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
What are you supposed to do?
Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Yeah.
You're going to go see her.
Well?
I don't know.
Thanks for the shine.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Fuckin' A.
Hey!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Gimme a dollar.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
You stole that.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Laughs.
That's pretty good.
I've done much better ones than this.
You have, huh?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Where are we going?
I'm not a baby.
You're a big girl, huh?
Close your eyes.
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
You got this under control?
Yeah.
It's under control.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
That one.
Keep your eyes peeled.
I'm looking for them.
Where?
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Only you.
That's enough.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Any trouble?
No.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He never told about the money.
No.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
I'll bet.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Here they come.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
O, she's all right.
How's your sister Pearl?
Leavin', boy?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
No.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
Don't!
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
Mr. Powell! Willa has run away!
Just went?
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
What can we do, Mother?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Bluebeard!
Twenty-five wives!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He lied!
Tricked us!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
What?
The money, Icey.
You go set down by the River.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Amen! Amen!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
What could have possessed that girl!
Satan.
Amen.
I tried to save her.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hing, hang, hung.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
Just a man. Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
John...
Now can I tell?
Hm?
You swore, Pearl!
John! Don't!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
It's all here.
Where's Mom?
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where are we g --
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Are we goin' home, John?
Don't you hurt her!
John, where's your folks?
Dead.
Where ye from?
Up river.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Tell me what, boy?
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
It -- she --
Yes. Yes.
I don't know nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I'll tell.
All right boy: where's the money?
All right... Come along.
What?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Don't you believe me?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Nothin'.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Yes; John's bad.
O no! Your turn!
All right.
I'm hungry.
Can I have my supper please?
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
No. No one never did.
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Mister Powell?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Harry!
I was praying.
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
I been bad!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
Miz Cooper!
What?
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
Guess I did.
Haven't slept, have you?
M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
No.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Hello?
Hi.
Who?
The killer.
You do?
Bring him out of what?
My dream.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Meanwhile...?
How you doing, pal?
Rod's not a lunatic.
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Just want to talk to him a second.
He's dangerous.
Hello Nancy.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Who? Who did that?
Krueger.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
It wasn't that serious...
Where you think you're going?
Did you sleep?
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I won't.
Get into bed.
What?
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
You okay?
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
I must be going nuts...
You okay?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Go even crazier?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
No.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Do you think I did it?
Rod says the sweetest things.
He's nuts about you.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
What the hell you doing here?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
An omelet.
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I have nothing to hide.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
And there?
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
No, that's not him...
That's her.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
Misha! Misha!
What is it?
That must be the one!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The Duchess...
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Your Highness...
Are they indeed? Thank you.
You're looking magnificent, Leon... ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can wait.
We can call our ambassador.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne...
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
We don't want to be disturbed.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Get out of here!
What proposition?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Razinin.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
What did she say about me?
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Bad news?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
That's even better.
Yes, monsieur.
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
What's that?
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous! Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Yes. It is unfortunate.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
You want me to go in there?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Business.
What business?
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
She must have her little joke. You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
You, please.
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
At what intervals does he whistle?
What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
In other words you don't know.
No.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Why do you need my finger?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Suppress it.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
That's a strange angle.
Yes, it is.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go? You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Yes.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Thank you. Thank you.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
You repeat yourself.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Was that talkative?
Thank you.
Glorious, analytical...
The telephone is ringing.
Oh, let it ring.
I must go.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
As a representative of Moscow...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
You know I want to...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I don't like your following me.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
Why?
Because we are an odd couple.
On which boat?
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I promise... I swear.
Did you make any change in this room?
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
What, darling?
Thursday.
Comrades! Comrades!
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Let's turn on the radio.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
...but big.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Is this the wish of the masses?
It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Yes, sweetheart.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Those newspaper people?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Oh, yes.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Huh?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
You can't imagine.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Thank you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
No thanks, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.
Hello, Leon darling!
Good morning.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
That's all right... I grow on people.
I must insist that you leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Here, please...
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
Well... that's my business, madame.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes, it does.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Yes.
May I ask why?
Cigarette?
Thank you.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Raw carrots and beets.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where to, madame?
Where do you eat?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Your Highness.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
You did say it, sir.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
We'll see about that ...
He's nervous, sir. He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms. He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify. But they're solid.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Executive clemency ...
Mitchell? Mitchell's ... family.
We could get that.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yes ... I got the money.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I'll bet he would.
That's not the question, John. The question is: Why is he paying?
It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.
Why me?
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
It's a code or something.
I figured that out.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Mitchell?
Hunt? Howard Hunt?
I like it. I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
In hiding. He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
He wants money.
This is not a joke, John!
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
We can't touch Hoover --
What about England?
Sorry ...
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell. It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
May I say something, Mr. President?
I don't have a pistol.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Who?
Cox! Fire him.
So?
Sir, the deadline is today.
Can we get around this, Al?
The army?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Fucking hell.
Well, why not?
But what are we paying him for?
Just do what I say, Bob.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Where are they?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.
He wasn't protecting me. He was putting me on notice.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Money. Follow the money.
Sir?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
She got it, Bob. A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
Congratulations, boss. A great victory! The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
Because they're not Americans.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
We could leverage Helms.
How?
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Yes, Mother ...
We haven't said grace yet. Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard. This law school is a gift from your brother.
What'd he say?
What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
What ... ?
Mom expects great things from you ...
My friends call me "Mister President."
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
I'm not Jack Kennedy. Your agency is secure.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
What?
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats? "The Second Coming"?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Ummm...
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Winning?
Oh, my goodness ...
How about you? Are you going to win?
Roselli? Johnny Roselli?
Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.
I never met the man.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
I always get my man.
How the fuck did you know?
Injections. Even this noble sport's been fixed. Seen the guys?
Why, you got a customer?
The White House.
You're fucking me.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank. We're gonna plug a leak.
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
She's quite pretty.
Well, goddamn. Are you threatening me, Dick?
Fuck it! He doesn't like me, John! It's your fault, Henry.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli. They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
That's right! And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
Housecleaning? It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
What a waste of time. My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we. Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
He was a politician.
Did you cry when he died?
Yes.
Why?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Looks can be deceiving ...
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife. I'm out of politics.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that.
It's a thing she does. She talks at night.
Uh, wait ...
How many?
Four. Two boys. Two girls. And eight wounded.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
But it was all we had.
Edgar, wonderful to see you. Clyde ... hi.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
We got the press this time!
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison. Gandhi, Lenin ...
What's in there?
POWs. And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate. Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
We lost ...
I know ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Amen to that.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
What are you saying? What are you talking about?
I want a divorce.
My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too!
I'll do it. No more.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
Buddy? ...
They love you, Buddy. They need you, too.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This. Above all.
Yes ... you know it! Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Anything.
Hi, Buddy. What are you doing in here?
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I do. I do. In my own way.
They're all your enemies?
Yes!
Congratulations, Dick.
Yes.
When?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
You. What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew. You're hiding.
No, it isn't. I won't interfere with you anymore. I'm finished trying.
Thank you.
Why didn't you?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
They were for me. They're mine.
Oh, Happy! Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Won or lost?
Lost.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
The "crises"?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha mean by that?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book. "Six Crises."
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
How'd you know I was here.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard it?
How's that?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
That man that shot you died in prison.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
You don't know what he thinks.
When did he die?
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Try "old" on for size.
None of that explains your man though.
Uh-huh.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Well what would you call him.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
He's real all right.
Oh yes.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Llewelyn Moss?
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Believe you're right.
Probably must be.
So when was he here?
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
No sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
...This month's checks.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
I thought it was a car afire.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Okay.
What do you think.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I got it Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
I ain't got the money.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
To your husband.
Not like that. Not like you say.
What's in the satchel?
It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Odessa.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Llewelyn --
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Promise?
Yes I do.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Uh-huh.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
You should be used to that.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
Hey.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did you tell him?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know something better.
What's that.
I know where it's going to be.
And where is that.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Hello?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
Huh? What is...
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
Not a bleep.
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
What airport would you use.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.
Who is this.
...You need to talk to me.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
...Me?
Yes.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
With what?
With anything?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
...What time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
You live in that house behind the store?
Yes I do.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Everything.
How's that?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Sir?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Tent poles.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Never mind. I want a tent.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
Good. I need everything else.
Okay.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
What room?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
It's all right.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
When did you last see him.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
...I'm wondering...
Yes?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
I'm sorry.
You tell me the option.
The what?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
Waitin' for my wife.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.
What else then?
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
...But that won't last.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
...What do you do?
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
Why would he go to Odessa?
...You didn't take the product, did you?
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I got an overcoat on.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Nam?
Yes sir. Two tours.
What outfit.
Could I have that in American?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...I meant your food.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
...plenty
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Oww! My arm, careful!
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
It wasn't a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Jesus...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Bad idea...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
"Banners?"
Need something else?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess... How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
That's my son! My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Umm... yes. Back home.
It's all right.
Aahhh... So what color is it?
What?
The LeSabre!
Maroon. I stole it.
What?
Yeah, me too.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Do what?
I gotta go.
...of course you do. You don't remember me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Oh, you mean Fred.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
She's a good person to know. So where did you study again?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
...like the water purifiers?
What?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
Make sure it's elevated...
Uh-huh.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I'd slap his face.
Where you headed, Betty?
Did you love it?
I left my husband two days ago.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's something I had to do. For David.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
How many men have I talked to?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Guess who I saw today.
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What are you doing?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
No, that should be more than --
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Huh?
The fuck you talking about?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Really. And where was that, old man?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
Could you give us an example?
I don't follow...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Like what?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
You told me how to do it!
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
It's not here. Let's go.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
We can live with that.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Like... us?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Half.
What?
I know that.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I dunno... something. Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
How'd they describe her?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Wesley...
Who's this?
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
I said 'got it?'
...yeah, I got it. Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
This is Betty at twelve.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
...and how long did she work here?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
I see. May I?
What'd you get her?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
I don't know, George...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Hmm?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
What the hell's going on?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
Better.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
What did you say?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
David Ravell.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
No. Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Her show?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -

It ain't the law!
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?

We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Gopher, Everett?
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Whuhh...

Uh, we uh-
Pete have a brother?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
In any state.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Latch right on to that tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Devil his due.
Ass right.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon Waldrip.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Not out the other side his face, though.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring! You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Not your...
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You said -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st. Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Who was fixing to betray us!
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
A million dollars.
An' all my meals for free...
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Pete... I do apologize.
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Who's the honcho around here?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
...Yeah?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.
I been calling for four months.
Come back here, kid!
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
Hi, Byron.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful? You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
You... in the Navy?
Who gave you this idea?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Who's that?
Great ass.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
I never said any of that!
I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Good morning, girls.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Joe!
Esther, do you think she's using... ...birth control?
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
You're good.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
Pardon?
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
No, sir.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Yes I do!
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I'm a little late, that's all.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Sid, there's no baby.
What?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Great.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Yeah... Mmmm...
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Everything was different.
You hope.
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No. I never feel like that.
God help you, Lynette!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really?
You got a girl?
Not me.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I know who you are and what you want.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
You're better than candy.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Hi.
Are those for me?
What would you do differently?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.
I'm looking for Sid.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I'd like to come with you.
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
That's brilliant.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Could you believe those girls!
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
You okay?
Hey, you guys still awake?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
That isn't true, is it?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Thanks for covering for me.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
What?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
No problem.
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
What the fuck is funny about this?
God.
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Stop it! Stop it!
Me. I am.
That's right.
Burning me. It's burning my eye.
I have the gun.
Yes.
Remember that.
What? What do you want me to do?
What do you think? Get us into that room.
You can. You're full of ideas. You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't...
One. Squeeze.
This is ridiculous...
Two. Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay! Okay.
You got an idea?
Are you okay?
The hell does she want?
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Get the fuck away from me.
Bullshit.
The walls are steel, right?
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
Fuck!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right? Isn't it?
Who is this guy?
Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
They won't get hurt.
What about us? What if she has a gun?
What tables? I've never seen him before.
Different tables.
It's still a good plan. It's just... got a twist.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Open it.
Be quiet.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
Cell phone.
She's never coming out.
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
We're not leaving. I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Everything okay?
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Huh?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
A what?
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
No fucking way.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait for the car...
No cars. Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
Something's weird.
What?
Makes me nervous.
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
No, Edgar Allen.
The furniture guy?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Open the door.
Too many stairs.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
The phone works. Hey, I hooked up the phone.
The crowd goes wild.
478...
Fuck him.
Don't.
What's going on?!
He's going down.
That room!
What?!
Damn it!
It doesn't work?!
Can't hear a thing.
What do they want?
What do we do?
Wait.
What if they get in here?
They can't. They can't get in here. No. They can't.
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Say fuck.
Fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
I am. I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Got him!
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
No.
What are you doing?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
Blue is phones?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble. He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you...
What?
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
Where is the Glucogen?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Tyrone...
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I'm okay... listen to me... Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Those ain't cops.
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
Well... is it loaded?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
What the fuck?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Yeah... whatever you say.
Get out of the car.
What's with you?
Inspector Brimmer
Yeah, it's me.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Man, fuck you!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
I don't know. Look around man.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
...Glad you came man.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Can you make a deal with them?
You want me to put a man on it?
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
You mean...
We need money first...
C'mon let's...
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
So talk...
Alone...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
You were. infantry right?
Yeah.
We appreciate your help with this.
So what's the deal?
I don't know.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
I saw... but...
Yeah, I do.
Just a kid.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Maybe...
Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right?
Huh?
If you got something to say, say it.
What's up with you?
Nothing.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You alright?
We'll all get out of here together.
My Mom's at that.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
What?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You don't look alright.
Yeah.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
No.
When?
Late summer.
Congratulations.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
That would be nice.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got me beat on both accounts.
He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed.
You don't know him very well, do you?
You got salt last week.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Excuse me?
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
We did.
My pleasure, sir.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Thank you.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
That is a separate issue.
Very well, let us move on to...
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.
My harrier. Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Are you going to meet with him?
If I fail, you fail.
Perhaps.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Probably.
How can we end this madness?
Civility is a secondary virtue. It is superseded by duty.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston. You have a letter inside.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
You're in no condition to ride.
Father...
What now, sir?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal... ... be careful.
How old are you?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it.
Father?
Gabriel? Are you asleep?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
No...
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She spoke? Susan spoke?
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
What?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Granted. Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
Where?
Don't go in there.
Is it her? Is Anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's right.
It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you.
I don't care. I hate him.
You don't hate him.
An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
I stand corrected.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
It's Mister Marion.
A long time ago...
Thirteen years...
You were an Englishman then...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Balderdash!
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Name five hundred.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
That's five, keep going...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
And your principles?
One of yours?
No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
Who's in command?
I am, I think.
When?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
His wife was killed yesterday. She was with child.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Thank you.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
How far away?
Don't worry.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
Reverend.
Thank you.
For what?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
How many came back?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Worse.
Not yet, Thomas.
Put those away.
But father, they might come this way.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Father... I killed those men...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Bite?
Well...I guess not.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Honey, Church will be fine.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Please hurry.
Yes.
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Because you promised.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
What's up, sugar?
But don't you dare say that.
You believe in it.
I'm not tired!
I'm sure you're not.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Do you swear?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
You need a glass?
Not at all.
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
You folks ready to go on?
Not yet...how much further is it?
It's Church.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
I don't know.
But--
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
What do you mean?
I'm not climbing that.
Yes. Where are we going, Jud?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
Is there quicksand?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Why? For God's sake, why?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
What did we do, Jud?
Can I have another one?
Yes.
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Leave me alone!
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The movers--
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
She's finally asleep.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I just said--
Well, honey...you know that...
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
Louis, are you sure?
You stole my boat.
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back. Or one better.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
She. Goes. Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that! Name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
That's right.
I'll torture it out of you.
Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You can go to your grave not knowing.
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
The situation has changed.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There's ... another exit?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Do you believe him?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means 'No.'
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Then why aren't you eating?
Do you not know what this is, then?
It's a pirate medallion.
Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Man overboard!
Boy overboard!
Did he speak?
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
I can't breathe.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
What?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Ceremony?
Difficult ... to say.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
It doesn't!
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
You?!
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
That was before I met one, of course.
Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
To freedom.
What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Nor did you, I noticed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
Make it last, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
A fool's errand.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
We're not going to just surrender!
All the men in place, sir. Ready to fire.
Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
You would do that?
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Move away.
No.
Move!
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
Is that so?
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Tortuga?
Just do it quickly.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
What's that?
Depends.
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! It's going badly!
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
... No.
No.
... no.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No. She hasn't.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Commodore --
A moment.
But --
Please.
How long do you leave him in there?
Speak.
Wheelchair accessible.
You can't mean that.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.
We will always love most that which we create. Don't you agree, Susan?
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
Poison? I'm surprised at you. You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me! I'll give you anything you want!
Like rotting meat.
Oh no? Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus. It will be ready soon.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She says it's not.
She's lying. She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky! What's happening?
Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Gently, Ott. Gently.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Do you think she loves him?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes. Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Icarus?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Consideration?
Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
Poppy, please --
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did you feel that?
Did I? I've been waiting for that for years.
Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Where did he go?
They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman. You have outdone yourself.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Hey!
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Here, kid, this is great stuff. Why don't you give it a try?
Yeah? So what?
What are you going to do? Make me throw it out?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I was just thinking...
Aaabout...?
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
A man?
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man.
What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.
You were never invited to my house.
I don't believe this is happening...
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Is that what Argon told you?
No! Well, not those exact words.
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
It's Sim. We're almost there.
What's it smell like?
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Susan!
Daniel...
When did you...?
Been out for six months now.
Really? What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
The big house?
The big house.
I guess I should be flattered.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
It already is.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Yeah.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Yeah, we'll see.
You're insane.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie! You gotta help me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
Mouse? What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
You don't know?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
Daniel!
We don't have time for hysterics.
What are these?
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why do we need it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
That's right.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
Just look at it!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
I feel very emotional right now. A bit out of control.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Uh oh. I remember that temper.
What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
How far can you stretch?
What did you want my hair for?
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
Who is he?
I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God.
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
Run, Daniel! Get out of here!
You saved my life.
What in the...?
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late. Argon injected it.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Yes.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
You're not going after Argon!
I have to!
I remember I was trying to help...
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
You! I remember you!
What? I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
You were looking for us?
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon? It's Sim.
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive. Technically.
And you have him?
Vermin...
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
I could have you fired right now.
Icky!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Indeed? How interesting.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
That's considerate of you.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
A little? Sure, I'll be right up. He's all right. I like him.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am Stewart.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Gallagher!
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I poisoned him.
I'm not going!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Anne, come here. Listen
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
That's an excellent idea.
What is this person doing here?
Ah-ah-ah!
Mother!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
You're the Tribune man?
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Well, I should say!
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Is that so?
Yeah!
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Thank you very much.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
I bring a message from Garcia.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Gloria Golden?
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Come on, get going, get going!
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
What play?
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Araby?
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
No?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Who are you?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
You're my what?
Dawson, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Oh no, sir!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
All right, outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Yes.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
That's a lovely dress.
Thank you. Where is Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
You what?
and that
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
I knew you would, pal. A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
There you are!
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Hello, Stew.
Okay.
How far have you gotten?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?
Conrad.
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Hey, Gallagher!
Sorry, boss
Who was that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What other girl?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
Surely, come right in.
I don't eat waffles.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She did?
Yes.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
What is it, Smythe?
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
With pleasure, Madame!
Stop calling me Mother!
Have you seen this?
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Me, sir?
No, sir!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
Well, sir, I putter.
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Yes.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes.
Yes ... It's just that ...
What?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
It's okay. It's alright.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
Wait.
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
I'm sorry ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Having kind of a tough time.
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
What?
She's crying.
No she's not.
Wait ...
I've got to go ...
It's alright. Let me see.
What is that?
You can't go out there.
But I really should get home.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
I told you where I was.
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Where are you gonna go?
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You want to get out of here?
What?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Sure is pretty.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It is?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
Oh. I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
What?
I don't believe it.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
What'll it be?
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
No. What?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
No. Of course not.
Are you alright? What is it?
Rain.
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
I think I've got something to say.
It's like the basketball team.
Okay--that's enough!
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
It's not in ME.
Oh sure it is.
Dan! Arrest them!
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What do you mean!?
Well, I never had to do it before.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know about the fire?
What?
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Bud.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Mr. Simpson ...
Yes.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Green.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Oh my God ... Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Lemme see that.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Get lost!
Oh my God.
What happened?
What did you do?
I don't know.
Noooooo!
Oh God.
What's going to happen?
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Just take deep breaths.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
You know him?
Play along?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Who's that?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Those are my friends.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
What?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
What were you doing in a library?
Jen, listen ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
Jen please ...
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
What did you do to him?
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Me too. Sounds swell.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
... Yeah.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
So what is it?
Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ...
Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
That was sure swell ...
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Keeps going ...
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.
So what's it like?
What?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.
You want some berries?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.
What's going on?
Rain.
Real rain?
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
Scout?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
... Her father.
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.
Yeah ...
What department store did they go to?
McIntire's.
How much does it cost?
What the hell's going on!
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Where are you going ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Hello there.
... Hi.
I can't.
What?
BUD.
I want a word with you ...
Oh--well ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
I didn't do anything wrong.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Why?
No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
OW!
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Why?
Because you're coming home.
Just gimme the damn remote!
How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Yeah ...
I'm so glad you're here.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Oh hi!
Bud ...
Yeah ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Forget about that!
Why?
You know what I really like?
... What's that?
Well don't you?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
It's an art book.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
What's wrong?
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's beautiful.
TV repair.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Free?
What happened?
Oh GOD ...
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Cool.
This is Barry.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Yes, I'll be there.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
...yes I'm still on hold...
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
No.
You look nervous.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Yeah I can't.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's not cool?
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Yeah I can't.
What's all this pudding?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
Hey. What are you doing?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hello, this is Back.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
No.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Are you watching a porno movie?
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Sure.
....no....
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
...just talking to you....
Are your pants off?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Really?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
It doesn't matter.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
No.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Where is she?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
...yeah.....
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
No.
Hello?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Not very late.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Me?
Yeah.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Really? Please?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
So you think you can?
No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
No.
They're not open yet?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
There's a piano in the street.
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Business is good, you're busy?
Yeah, not really.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Oh My God.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Sure.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
This is funny.
Ok.
Alright?
....Hi.....
Who is it?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
You like her?
Yeah?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah.
You see?
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
Is everything ok?
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you pick it up from the street?
What?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Yeah.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
This is Lena.
Really?
Yeah.
That was good.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Hello?
Lena?
Yeah?
It's Barry.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yes.
About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?
yeah.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
Do you wanna have sex?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
This is funny.
Yeah.
Where do you have to go?
For what?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
Are you ok?
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Did you have my home phone number?
For what?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok.
Ok, bye, bye.
Why?
Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Why?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.

You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Yeah.

Hey.
Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
Wait a minute --
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Please don't do this.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
How much money do you have in your pockets?

What is this, man?
I'm sorry.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
This is Barry.
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
What time are you gonna be there?
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I know.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I don't really remember that.
That's cool.
When can you leave?
Your expenses are your own.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Ok.
That's it.
So they'll go.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Put him through.
It's ok. That's alright.
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you sure?
We should be going --
You ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Just tell him to call me.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
No.
He did seem a little strange.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
He's a writer, not a madman.
At your service, Count.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Ow!
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
In part, yes.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
By whom? The Marquis?
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
What? What've I done?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Free his mouth.
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
It's not even noon --
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
Enough to discern its tenor.
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
What the devil --
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
I have a proposition.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Good day, Marquis.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- water! --
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Coulmier, you animal!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Abbe de Coulmier!
I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's influence.
His wife's?
Oh. That.
Well...?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Do you favor its publication?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Shut down?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
And place my reputation at stake?
And --?
I have.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
It was fiction, of course.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
He'll do no such thing.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
Poorly.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Yes?
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Quite.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll be waiting.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Yes?
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Don't start --
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
A kiss for each page.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
It's a long story, this one.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
They've taken your clothes?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
...yes, I've got that bit...
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I am not a wealthy woman.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
Oh, but I am!
-- words alone are insufficient.
I am eternally in your debt.
And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Of course.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
You've come to lecture me?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Leave at once --
But it's just begun --
Doesn't that please you?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
That poor woman.
God, these parties are the worst
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
I can't
Sure you can, just--
I did my best but, well, you know me
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Uh-huh
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Who are you, sir?
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
So I've been told.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Louis
Randolph!
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
There's no call for that language-
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
How bad is it?
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
How much?
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
This picture--
Then you explain it to me?!
There's nothing to explain
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I will not have this in my home.
Yes?
Thank you for your time
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Sir?
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir, I-
He lied to me
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Keep filming.
I can't remember the lines!
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
He personally asked you to?
Hearst?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Can I talk to Hearst?
What are movies about, Orson?
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Not for me.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Right-
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Like a bug.
But with compassion and insight--
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Manolete?!
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Jesus
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Yes.
Please don't say this.
Mank-
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Don't do this
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Let me out.
Listen to me-
He'll destroy us.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Why her?
It's 350 pages long.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Craig is one syllable
Uh huh.
I want you back
Fuck you. You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
Hedy Lamarr?
It's too late. The movie's made
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You gonna watch?
Hell, I know how it ends. Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Shit
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Very generous
To do what?
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're lying to me.
You talked to New York?
Yes
Yes
Get out
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
CITIZEN KANE
Pardon?
Please don't ask me to do this.
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Then find another theater
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
Well it' s all you've got !
For Christ's sake, shut up--
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
You're not still mad at me, I hope
I think you better sit down
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Oh God. . .
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson, you wanna take five?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
How 'bout a real drink?
We done?
Oh, no--
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Hey champ!
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I'm Ok.
Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What's up, Colonel?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Where you going at this hour?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
And where you goin'?
You're a good sport, lady.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Harder. Take the towel off.
Jack! Enough!
Answer me when I talk to you.
Who's that?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Yeah --
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Do you see her yet?
You want us to wait for you?
You want the title shot?
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
What do you mean?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
C'mon, Joey.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
How's that?
When?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What do you mean, "you"?
What?
But you said "you."
Did you ever fuck my wife?
What?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Whadda ya mean?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Don't fight anymore! It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You don't talk very much.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
No.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Come over here.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Take off my pants.
Jake...
Now take the rest off.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
I like the gym smell.
Now, touch me... ...here.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Don't ever do that again. You don't do it!
I went out.
Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What're you talking about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You did?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake --
What?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
OK. Talk.
No, not that.
Then what?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Open the door, Vickie.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Are you drunk?
The kids are sleeping.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
C'mon, Tommy --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
How's the weight? Ok?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
This is Doyle's house.
This is the baby sitter.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it. Thank you.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
You think I made all this up?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me. I've got to run, Jeff.
Thanks.
By the way what happened to your leg?
I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
You think he's getting out of here?
Jewelry?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Did you ever own a saw?
But I'm not a killer!
Jefferies.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Where'd they take Lisa?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Wrong day?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Read some good books.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Like what?
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Hello.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Something wrong?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Hello.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Why should I?
I don't know what you mean.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Can you get me that ring back?
No.
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I knew it!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight. What kind of trouble?
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
No.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
She's just not the girl for me.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
How did you know!
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
I was.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Keep your mind off her.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And some man will lose his.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Isn't he a salesman?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
A Federal offense.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
Police?
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Mrs. Thorwald?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
What?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?
No.
There's probably one in the basement.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
Ten here.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
What about the rest?
Hello.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Who's Thorwald?
He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Something big going on somewhere?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Big enough?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
What a day I've had!
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
That's good news.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems. Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
What do you think?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
No comment.
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
To get on home.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Someone not his wife?
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
We have all -- what?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
That's a suitcase?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
It's utterly beautiful. I wish I could be creative.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I do?
The same.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird. Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
But you're not?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Is he cleaning house?
Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
What for?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Steady Marlon!
What's that?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
I heard about it. You're lucky he lived.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
You know something?
What?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
What?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
You satisfied or you want more?
Where can we meet?
Just him.
What you say your name was?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
Sure. It's fine.
This is the edge, boy. This is the end.
Yeah.
I like you, you know?
Buzz? What are we doing this for?
We heard firing. He get anybody? You alone?
We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier.
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
What's he going to pull--
Nothing, Crunch. They picked him up like the rest of--
You see any cops?
No--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
No. We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
What time is it?
Hang loose. We got all night.
That maid saw us. She could identify us too.
You still want to go home, Moose?
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
Mother--
So long, young fella. Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!
It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
And you dropped it?
Yeah! Shh!
That's funny!
You awake?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
What would you do, Dad?
Blood.
How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Go ahead.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Sure--there was a bad accident there. They showed the pictures on T.V.
Will you let him tell it!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You don't?
Whoa! Whoa! I know you're a little upset but--
Sorry.
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim. Don't forget.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
You sure?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Really, Frank? When was that?
Can't you answer? What's the matter with you anyhow?
He's just loaded, honey.
Frank? I'm frightened.
What's that pounding?
I don't know. First I thought it was Jim but--
He's home. I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
See? It stopped.
Who's there? Anyone there?
Is he there?
Frank!
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.
My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
Hi.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No. I don't think so--
Boy!
What?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What?
He's a wheel. So's she. It's hard to make friends with them.
What's your name!
Jim. What's yours?
I know. That's why I came back.
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
I'm here.
Are you really going to meet them?
Who knows. Plato?
What?
How'd you get here?
I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
Jim!
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me? What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.
We know.
They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
Judy.
Hey where'd you go?
I'm here. Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up. Are you nuts?
We're safe here. I hope. What do you think?
Isn't it crazy?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
What you run out on me for! What you leave me alone for?
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
I've got a gun.
That's swell. How are you?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No. At dawn.
Why?
I just have a feeling. Where are you?
We didn't run out. We were coming right back.
You sure?
No.
Can I keep it?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
In your pocket. Give it to me.
I need it.
Why?
They like you. Okay?
Who's that?
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
Those aren't my friends. Make them go away.
Plato!
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
'Bye, Mom.
How!
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
Good Lord!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
What's that got to do with it?
He's not saying that! He's saying don't volunteer!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Get lost.
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
Leave me alone.
No.
I don't know why--!
He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
Pretty mixed up?
If he could--
Chicken?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Okay--
Any time--day or night. You calmed down enough to go back now?
Hey! That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now. I'm warning you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Plato!
Hi. I saw you before.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Where I saw you. Everything going okay now? You live around here?
Who lives?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
Where's Dawson High School?
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah. So where's the high school?
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
A what?
Goodbye! See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
You still pretty upset?
You cold?
No.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why?
I'm getting that way, too.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Sure. Lots of times.
So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
Where you going?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where can we go? I can't go back into that zoo.
You can trust me, Judy.
Oh, Jim!
No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course. Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly. It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know.
Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
Hi.
What?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already. We don't have to pretend now.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It is for me too.
No!
We have to go back!
After he tried to shoot you?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.
Sure. He was trying to make us his family.
Is he your friend?
Yes. My best friend.
Want to finish my hamburger? I only took a bite.
I did? Well, he might as well be dead. What's the difference?
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He hates me.
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
She's being called for.
You said you'd call my father.
But the same song. I think it's fantastic!
We were romantic then too--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
No. Why?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
With us old creeps? Come on, we have to eat.
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'm tired, Judy. I'd like to change the subject.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
You promised me!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
To all those cons...
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
You can't find... what?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Toys for... adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
No, no --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Do that again.
What.
No --
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Ashley, Jesus --
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. Hurry up!
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You forget where I work?
Beauty and fragrances.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
I'll see what I can do.
NO!
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
You motherfucker.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick, I love you --
Get the hell off of me!
He'll kill you.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
Nick died for me....
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Gabriel!
No!
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down?
What?
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
That guy knows you?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
Nick, the ice is --
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
You saved me.
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
I don't know...
Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
He wants to see your map.
I'm almost done.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
No.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
You shouldn't have.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I'm glad it was me.
What?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
You... you don't know me --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
No, you can't --
Who are you now.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
You're not Nick Mason...
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
Yes!
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Where's she work?
What?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Samantha.
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
Hey, it's... been two years --
Hell. Ten?
What?
I said, who the hell made the map?
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Might as well be.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
You got one hour.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Nnn... nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Start singing.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Six men means six guns.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Take 'em.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
What... Powwow...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
...so where is he?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
What about the Powwow Safe?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Cancer-sucker.
That motherfucker --
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
What the hell was that about --
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters... ...in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Haven't thought about it.
Hell you haven't.
Ain't there yet.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
Hot chocolate.
What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
I'm just talking.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hate your old man.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Alamo...
Jesus, Rudy --
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Tell Ashley... I...
YOU TELL HER!
NO!!!
...for Christmas...
How'd you know I'd do it.
Do what?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
But... I had a five...
Switch seats with me.
I'm ninety-two years old --
There is no other table --
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Alone at last.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Seymour Scagnetti.
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Elois?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Where was she from, Compton?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, did ya see that?
What?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Who, Mr. White?
How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
What's this?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
But what is this?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
What?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
I'm sorry.
Just hold on buddy boy.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
It's a change.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
Give me this fucking thing.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
What do you care?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
What for?
What's the cut, poppa?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Don't ask me that.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink? Why?
He don't tip.
He don't tip? You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it.
He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it?
Aren't you?
I know.
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
So, talk.
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Follow you where?
Down to my car.
Why?
For what, the cops?
You didn't ask.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I'm okay.
Joe.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
Gun shot.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad. Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
I'm cool.
Want a smoke?
That's not correct.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
A few cops.
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do you think?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Nope.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
For all I know, you're the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If we don't, he'll die.
Is that supposed to be funny?
We don't think this place is safe.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
I told ya he'd be pissed.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Not these guys.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Maybe he did.
Who shot who?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
It doesn't matter who they are.
What's the matter with her?
This must have been in the family a long time.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
You can't leave us here.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
So am I.
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
There's a nice boy.
Yeah.
Like what?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
He's learning his letters.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Hold on.
We can't stay here!
Coffee?
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I suppose it is.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
The who?
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
Tell me, darling.
What?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
All my clothes --
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I won't have you fighting over me.
It's going to Sonora.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Thanks for taking over.
Where you going?
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Which ranch?
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
I don't want to run short.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
What was he in jail for?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov! We come along here.
And meet him there.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Where'd they go?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
That's right, Steve.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Finished, son?
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Go on, hit me.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
How's that?
Kind of sore.
You'll live.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I said I didn't care.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Stop it -- stop it.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You got no business snoopin' around --
That something I shouldn't see?
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
And you're all alone.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
You're not giving up?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
How do you know who we are?
Everybody knows --
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Clay Phillips.
Where is he?
How far up the trail?
We got to get movin'.
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Put on another one.
What are you doin' --
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Would you like to learn them?
I sure would.
You're so nice.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Gee, I can't.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
That's the end of the line.
And that's tough, isn't it?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
No.
How about California?
Well, Steve?
And you've got me all figured out?
You were supposed to be reading words.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I found a picture of his wife.
I think he wants me.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Really? That's amazing.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Ouch!!
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Cindy, what's going on?
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
No, stay.
You sure?
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Where's Shorty?
Ray, run faster.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Yeah.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Buddy...
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
What about you, Buddy?
He's here.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Can you feel that?
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, let me...
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
Are you okay?
I think so.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Okay, I get the point.
So, whatever happened to her?
Let her go, Cin.
But he'll kill her!
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
It's okay.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Where's Shorty?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
Stop! --
It was you...
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What are we gonna do?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Father!
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
My child you are the only survivor.
I'm sorry.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Huh?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Am I cool now?
Aww, the little bird died.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
Uh, uh.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Saw who?!
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Would you please focus?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
The image there.
Professor, we need to talk.
What is it, Dwight?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
You do.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
And sexy.
That's right.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Yours, or the turkeys?
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
It's okay. I understand.
Father.
Would you like to see the girl?
Yes.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Because she will lie?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
What?
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
I woke up naked, too.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy!
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Did you hear?
What happened?
What a bitch!
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??...
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother?
0h, shit!
You don't think...
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Is MOM... in there?
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
Hi!
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You said you hated him.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Chip, honey?
Oh God, really! This is the limit!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP!!
God, Mom! What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
He goes to college with me!
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
Look at this! "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
That's nice.
Sorry, son. This is a matter for adults.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Goodnight, honey.
Don't I get a kiss?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We can be real quiet...
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
"P" as in...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
I certainly did.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Objection! Argumentative!
Hello.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try... "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Just a half-a-cup. Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
It's not fair!!
What did you just say?
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I... I'm not sure... ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Who wants fruit salad?
I do, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's him!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
You got your wish.
Beverly, are you alright?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine. Thanks for remembering.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Beverly, honey, you've got some... ...do-do on your shoe.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
...Browsing.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Yes, but I lent it...
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. A little something I baked.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He's a good boy.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Certainly not!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Murder, honey.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What's he know?
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I'll take this instead.
You know who I am, August?
Yeah - sure.
You think my sister is there?
You can't tell.
I don't like this.
Which room is it?
You scared?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
I'd like to get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
You could go and open the door.
Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Drink.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much does she want?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
But tell me --
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Why, Mary --
Hello, Frances.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Redi's all right.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
What did she want?
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
And that was all?
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
But you do believe me?
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
But you have treated me that way.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
The people at the restaurant?
What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I'm going to find your sister.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
What's that?
Let her know what?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
And then?
I don't know.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
You'll be all right?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Yes.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I have to go -
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
What was she to you?
I've lost my knack.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Wait - there is that other favor.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
I think it's time.
Perhaps.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Dr. Judd?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Cloven hoof?
Would they hurt her?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
But you would like to know where she is?
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
She's not been here for a long time.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult 
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Ann?
Yes?
That was quick.
False alarm.
Have you ever been on television?
Television?
Yes.
No. Why?
Oh, uh-huh.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
Sister older or younger?
I don't know.
What's the first?
Would you mind?
No.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I feel like they do.
So what about kids?
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Why is that?
You're what?
Impotent.
My therapist said that --
You're in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Of course not.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Hi!
Ann. Hello.
Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What are these?
Videotapes.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Who's Donna?
Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
You just ask them questions?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
To you?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I know.
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
I have money.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Do you talk to him?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Is he going to see this?
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes.
Yes, I have. I will.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
No.
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Yes.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.
On tape?
No.
Can't.
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
Her name was Elizabeth.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
So you lied to her?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You're really never going to make love again?
If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
I can't.
Why not?
I've told you.
Who? Elizabeth?
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
But that was part of it?
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Don't do that.
Why not?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I want to touch you.
Graham...
John?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Yes. I just got busy.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Something wrong?
Well, are you?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
What?
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
Where did you go when you left here?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Goddam right.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
God damn you!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Yeah, I know.
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
What visitor?
Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
I guess.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I hate my sister.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
Let me talk to him first.
And what?
Lose something?
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Fine.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
No, I didn't.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
He just asked me questions.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You are in trouble.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I can't believe you did that!!
Why?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You couldn't do it, period.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
I feel like I do.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I don't want to discuss it.
Here it is.
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
Do you have my work number?
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
No, I touched me.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
You want me to leave?
She still is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
How did you find me?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Not exactly.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Why don't you let me tape you?
Doing what?
Talking.
About what?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Nothing.
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
Yes.
Would anybody else see the tape?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
How do we start?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
No.
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
When I was fourteen.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Very much live.
What did he say?
He said that my hand felt good.
Then what happened?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
If you wish. You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
Hello.
Okay.
No.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
So make an exception.
I would.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I've got to get back to the office.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Why?
Who said I was jealous?
Could be risky.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.
I'm intrigued.
Hello.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
John?
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh. Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
John Millaney.
I want to see you.
When?
Hello.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Do you want me to stop calling?
What's so stupid about it?
I like the way he dresses.
You told Ann about this?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Why not?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
No.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
You trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Plenty of room for two people.
It'll just be me.
Student?
No. You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
Everybody has a past.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Hi, John.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
No.
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Answer him, goddammit!!
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
IBM.
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
Hi.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Kiss, kiss?
Another kiss?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
You say something?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Yes? Who is there?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Gonna cut me open?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready? Who cares?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
That you, Rog?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
I don't get it.
He didn't make it.

How's Brad?
A wreck.
Check. The quacks are willing tools?
Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Sank you! Velcome! Sank you!
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
What?
You got it!
I got it! I got it!!!
Infantile regression.
You got it!
Introduce yourselves.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists! That sounds pretty drastic.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
When do I get to see Brad?
SIN-I-FUL
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
How did you come by this scenario?
I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
SPONSOR!!!
Dentonvale has been sold.
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
A free thinker.
Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is...
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?
Yes, Betty.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look. Look at that. Bert Schnick can see. Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
Indulge?
He was a President.
President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really. What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh. Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.
I'll leave you young things to it.
Shove it, Ralph!
That's us.
I don't want to get up there.

Mental instability?
He was adopted you know.
Oh, Harry. What are we going to do?
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Mr. Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could I do that later?
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Why?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
You're practically naked!
Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
I'm sorry, Officer.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.

No! He's never done that before.
Just one or two details. Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Me?
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
Do you really think so?
You've got a really tight team around you. And everybody needs you!
. . .For his own good.
BRAD!
Arrest that man! He's committed to our care.

Hi! Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Ah, Macy. Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Isn't she lovely?
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
It's Christine. Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
I love you.
Miles.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Are you there? Miles?
So I guess that's it.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Gary.
When's that novel of yours coming out? We all want to read it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
What do you think?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
You okay, Miles?
They're from both of us.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Two years ago, buddy.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Stephanie.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Oh yeah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great. You both do.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
I can explain.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
I can't help the traffic.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Oh, that's tasty.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's your problem, Miles.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
What do you smell?
That's what you do with every one.
When do we get to drink it?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
She is very hot.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
She works for tips!
How do you know?
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Nice, huh?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what? When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
So what should I wear?
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Later.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
You should call her.
I will. See ya!
Right now.
What'd Christine say?
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Understanding of what?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nice shot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Is it the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're on.
What exactly are we going to do?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
What?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
Thanks.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
That's thoughtful.
Huh. Let me think.
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
Fucking chick's married.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
She tell you she was married?
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.
Me?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hrnrnrn?
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
No, I'm okay.
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Love you, man.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
I finished it.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hi.
Hey.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Yeah, I know.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
What about me?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Maya.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Victoria.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hello?
Ken.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
See you over there, Miles.
How much skin and stem contact?
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
French or American?
Both.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
So what do you think?
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Where's Jack?
Huh.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's the matter?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Only for pee or poop.
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
There's dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
My ballet recital.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Hi sweetie.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...I will.
...Tell Graham --
I'm here.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Morgan, be careful.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Yes.
How can you say that?
Do you feel comforted?
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
They're broadcasting...
How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Yes.
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
We might lose the signal.
I'm getting out now.
Morgan?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Oh.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Bimboo?
Dad.
What's two?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we going to sleep?
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
I can't even imagine.
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
The footprints.
What about them?
It's not broken.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay. So he was tall?
Is anything missing?
It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is he okay?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
It's like War of the Worlds.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
What book!
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
...And you had to kill him?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
I think we lost 'em.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Sounds good.
Forget it.
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
You'll never make it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Kate?
Gotta go.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I already did that.
This time you're really going? You know where I'll be.
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
No, Leavenworth.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
I gotta be going.
Going to Turley, was it?
What's Turley like?
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I understand.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Where you been?
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
Yeah?
I'll see you around.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
What about the law?
Believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
What now?
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
He is now.
Who is he?
Get out of here, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
New record.
Howdy.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
That ain't right.
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
He was murdered.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
What's stopping you?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Why him?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Because they enjoy it.
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What about his brother?
Things are getting messy around here. I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I heard that too.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
It's been a while.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You got a place to stay?
I just got to town.
What brings you into my saloon?
Luck, I guess.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Yeah. Bad luck. Good-bye, Cobb.
You work here?
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Stella.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner?
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
What is it that I can't figure?
What do you mean?
What makes you say that?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right. You understand perfectly. I will confess to fraud, not murder.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Okay -- for you.
Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
No! You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
The public decides who's on that list.
-- It's called a projector.
The picture's dead.
Where is she?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question. A circus like that?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
No problem. Do you want to come in?
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
"Forever".
Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She'll drive herself.
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own. Theater training.
She was in the theater? When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once. She's very disciplined.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
What about it?
There isn't one.
No need. She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
Better late than never.
I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
Soon. Soon.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- You can't go in there!
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She doesn't want pity.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
She said you were very beautiful.
Really?
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
-- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
Are you and Simone... ... getting married?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
She's lying down. She's exhausted.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
About now. Would you like a drink?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Impossible.
I just read somewhere --
Of course she will. Her public will demand it.
Not if I don't let her.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you! I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.
Hello?
Well, here I am. You look pretty today. Red suits you.
Where are you?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey. There's nothing here.
So you did meet her?
Of course. What are you suggesting?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Of course.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
No, I'm okay.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure. Where would you like to start?
That's true. I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
How will you do our love scenes?
Body double.
Absolutely not!
But she's right there! I must feel her!
You can't.
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No. No. A real wall. You ran right through it.
Is she here?
I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
I know what you mean.
No. In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
You want me to call Security?
I was misquoted.
-- Eight years ago. In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I'm sorry.
You have to see her.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank. A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
I don't know anything about computers.
That's why you're so perfect. You have something I don't have.
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
I won't be here next week. The tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead.
Harry! Harry! Can we have a minute? What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart. It's important.
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
There was no other way.
I missed you. I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Me too.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
You know, I... don't know.
Is she here tonight?
Can't you stop that?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Okay. But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
How?
I read.
Okay, Dad.
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly. Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
One thing bothered me.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey. How's your love life?
I do okay. How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
Really? Too bad.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it. I don't want a car, Dad.
About you and mom?
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Do I know you?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
It's bogus. You used an old library shot for the background.
The background is.
I've done my homework. I've studied her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Don't you?
Is it a jamming device?
Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
My God, you've got one?
Mr. Sayer...
What do you want -- ?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
It's a hotel.
I don't understand.
-- Nicola! How was your massage?
Taller, Viktor.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Yes.
Would you like me to read?
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Good.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You did create me.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Okay. Fine. Understood. I'm off then.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
Dr. Crowe.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
You use needles?
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
You want to ask me a question?
You mean aneurysm.
Where should I look then, Cole?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
I don't tell her a thing.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What'd you write?
Words.
What kind of words?
That isn't magic.
What?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
I didn't know you were funny.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
How often do you see them?
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Cats?
Yes?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
I don't know, Cole.
I have to.
When?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
--What?
Don't cry.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was... I was a fake.
You weren't a paper champion.
Dr. Crowe?
Yes.
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
You were great in the play, Cole.
Really?
And you know what else?
What?
They're right here.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Communicate?
You know that accident up there?
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
What?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
She wanted me to tell you--
Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Like what?
I don't know how else to look--
What--
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
...He doesn't get invited places.
Chuck E. who?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Meaning?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Superstition.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Chicken blood on the crops.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Alright!
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Nope.
See?
Get off his case sweetie.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Slut.
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Someone actually... employs you?
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
...Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Aha. The Lovers.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Gene.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Sounds familiar.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
You're out of your mind, man.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
"And a slash-slash there --"
He means moon shining.
Harvest moonshining!
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
How... was she "called?"
Pardon?
This is his room... isn't it?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
You'll be back.
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Ow!
What's wrong?
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Who? Us?!
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
He started it.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yes!
Yeah. That's just the problem.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
What about Jeremiah?
What's wrong?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
So?
Let it go.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
You wouldn't understand.
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
You're... limping.
Suzie... No.
It's you. You and your father.
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
I almost thought for a second...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
What is it?!!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Like what?
Like your guitar break.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
-- Where have you two been?
Where's Mac?
Carl.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Someone better tell Mac.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Shit.
Bill, we need to talk!
How are you going to find him?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
That's not funny.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
No. What ?
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
No reception out here.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
What are you doing?!
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
Rorschach.
Looks like a chipmunk.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Shelby --
Are you nodding?
Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Sorry.
I got to leave my post.
Hey there, Chief.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Who's the lucky fella?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
What can I do you for?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Flip.
Where are you going?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
What are you doing?
Who's that?
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
What's he get if he wins here?
America's bored. Now, what do you want?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Last year, this was a new rig.
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth. Well?
You got my barley pop?
Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Who'd want to?
I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.
A what?
So tell me about yourself.
Well?...
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
Guess what?
I give up.
Anything?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You could've asked.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Mississippi's the other way!
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
How do you know?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Yeah?
Kate...
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Well, thanks for the lift.
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
Why should I?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Yes.
I'm begging.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
But you'll do it?
I'll do it.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
What's your pleasure?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
Order up!
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Cledus.
No.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per. Forget it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
No.
See.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Also boring.
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Go.
Six. Got it.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Bandit?
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Loud and clear.
He's history.
Shit! No one's here.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Hit the brakes!
Let's get the hell outta here.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
We still on schedule?
I hate to say I told you so.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's your twenty?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
Bandit?
Yeah, guy?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
You okay?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
I'm here.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker. Breaker.
Go breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Go head on, breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Breaker. Breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
I think you're just yellow.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Have any trouble getting here?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Yes, ma'am.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
Five thou.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
And a very bad gamble.
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
Mortal.
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Did he give you his name?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
Uh, yeah.
You're sure?
Yeah.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
Thass' right. I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I'm here, where's the car?
Your attitude sucks.
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
About what?
Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
FUCK YOU!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
Here. Sit. Please.
Where's Israel?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
...Does he know?
...Are you insane?
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...So you made another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
So how we lookin'?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
I'm working on it.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- never in a million girl --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
You love her?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? You hurtin' pretty bad?
For real?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
Like a mafucka.
That takes some of the sting out.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What!?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What's wrong?
I DON'T KNOW!
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Gibarian.
Can it work?
I can trust Rheya.
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
No? Who am I, then?
What happened to Gibarian?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Where's his body?
In the lab. With her, probably.
No. There's no behavior modification.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Yes.
That's fantastic.
You killed her!
She'll come back.
No, she won't.
You fucking bastard...
It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow? Did you call him?
What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian?
He's dead.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I can't talk just now. I'm too tired.
Where's Sartorius?
In his lab. He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
Is there anybody else here?
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.
Who was it?
Tell me. I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
That depends.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.
My wife.
She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name?
Will she come back?
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
What will you say?
To who?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Kelvin, you awake?
What is it?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Why?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? I don't think so.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying. Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
What happened?
What do you want?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What plan?
Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Her oxygen would have run out.
What's wrong with you? We need your help.
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
Oh, God. I'm awake.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
Why?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
What are they?
To calm your anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Book?
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
You want to fuck her?
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Let's go home.
You go home.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
You're better when you take them.
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?
What do you mean?
Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
What happened?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
Where've you been?
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I think so.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
Yes. Yes.
What's wrong.
You don't love me.
What are you talking about?
Who have you been talking to?
Sartorius.
But we fought.
Yes. Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No. I love you.
Can you sleep?
You're the coward.
You don't want me.
Rheya.
But that's what happened before.
Do you want to stay here?
Do you?
What's wrong?
Gibarian. He was here.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
I'm not Rheya. You've always known that.
Rheya --
I'm disgusting.
No.
You're lying. I'm not human.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
Then you'll die.
Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
I can't stay here.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I want you here.
You're lying.
You exist here. I keep telling you.
That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.
Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?
I want to stop taking those pills.
I wish you wouldn't.
They do something to me. It's hard to think straight.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Am I really her?
What are you taking?
What does it want?
Where did you go before?
When?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
Why do you say that?
We thought you'd be alone. We want to talk about...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
Claire!
They've got two monsters now. Both boys.
And so what's with Steinhart? Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's terrific Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Straight ahead.
Right. That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
What did he say?
You live in Manhattan?
Queens... You know Queens?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Would you pick one out, please?
Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey! There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
I'll come with you.
Hi. Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning. Identify him.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
Claire?
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
They're kind of fuzzy.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
Yeah. It was.
Yeah.
That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
But "nice".
What about Neil?
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Good night, Mike.
Claire?
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
You put me life in danger.
You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
I don't know you...
You told her?
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
You don't want to know.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
When can I see you?
Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
What a memory.
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
How long you going away for?
Long enough.
"For"...?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you came.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire. We all do --
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling. It is.
What are you talking about?
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...
So how'd it go?
I can still use a gun.
Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey. The neighbors.
I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
No! No! I'm sorry. Ninety-seven five right?
Bought it.
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.
Coming to bed?
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
Mike, take it easy...
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault! I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry. I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm sorry.
What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What about Tommy?
Was it Venza? Did you get him?
Ellie...
I just sat and listened.
Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
They're operating on him. He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
At my house...!
Let's go. We're takin' her home! Move it! Get the cars!
Koontz! I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT. We'll get the locals. Throw it!
Do it, or look for another profession. That's a choice I guess.
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Uh, yeah. I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
Are you in charge here?
No, sir...
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You're here 'til what time?
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
I get my hostage first. No one's turned loose until I say so.
Let my kid go.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Under the table.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
How do you know where the gun is?
Lay back, Mack.
God! Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...! God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?" You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
What! What kind of pathetic line is that?
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Sexual tension...
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Remember Little League?
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Oh, sure.
Cause if you get in a bind--
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
I know.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
I was there.
See?
Lizzy!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Mistake? Hey, guy, get back here!
Flash, get lost.
You maniac. You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Ooooh. Your feet are on fire.
Harry
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Don't be pitiful.
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Now tell me you love me.
Lemme down, bugface!
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip. Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Parker-- you go here, right? Got your camera?
Yeah--
Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks.
Can we make it a hundred?
Can't focus...
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh. Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I see. So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Just call me Spidey.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
All right, amazing. Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Huh?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate--
No. I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz. You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene. Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
What are you doing this weekend?
I've gotta study.
Brrr. It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
What's your problem?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Do you mind if I come too?
Well, no.
So? The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
Hello, Liz.
Hold it. Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.
You sure about all this?
Of course.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence. "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right? We'll see ya.
Yeah, Roz.
Roz? Rosomoff? What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I'll introduce you.
Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'm a photographer, remember?
It's Friday night...
Yes. Do you have a date?
The record--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that. You promised you'd burn it.
Absolutely no class.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine. Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
How is he?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue. That's 561-5151--
Ha. Anti-gravitational particles.
Power down. I need to talk to you.
Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
No. No thank you. I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
How much do you know about it?
Need any more help?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Luck. The right place at the right time.
Really. I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know. Go get some sleep.
The paper, my boy. A solid B-plus.
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Like it?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
What?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Bonkers.
Loonytunes. And yet...
Spider-Man, be careful! He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
Ready?
Roger.
Coming up.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
There's only one pair left.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
That's right.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
What are you looking at him for? Any objections, Sefton?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Have a cigar.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Come again?
Break it off!
How much more do we have to take from him?
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Sefton!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
What some brandy?
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You are being rude again.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
It is.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Interesting.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl!
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
Shut up, Animal!
Stop it, Harry!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
What's the award?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You're teasing me again!
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
So what? There's other women!
You'll fix me up!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Betty! Betty!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes, sir.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Says who?
Says me.
Lay off, Sefton.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
You heard that, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You starting that again?
How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Yeah?
Give this to Joey, will you?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Thirty-fifth.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
What did you say?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
December seventh, forty-one.
What time?
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can -- Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner! Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Toh-pak-cha=8A
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
He is.
Target their Bridge.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
This is its current position.
Are any of them inhabited?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. I get it.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
Data, are you all right?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Can you locate them?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
No, no. Thank you.
We don't have a tractor beam.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Better?
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.
Close to retirement?
That's right.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes. Thank you.
I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. Scotty?
But I do have a theory...
A photon torpedo?
Aye.
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
What's normal?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Sir?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Report.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, are you all right?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor Soran?
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
The Nexus.
The royal...studs?
It looks like we're too late.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Status!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Put me on the hailing frequency.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Calm yourself, Bones.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
What did you see, Chekov?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Could it be Spock's?
I don't believe it...
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Hello, sir. It's David.
David!... What went wrong?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature -- Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
. .. Spock's tube...
What is it?
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Not exactly.
Why?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
... How long?
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I'll go...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
None that I can detect, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
Mr. Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Sir...?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Good shooting, Scotty.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
How many more?
Just him, sir!
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
What happened...?
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Yes. And I know you.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
You would have done the same for me.
Why would you do this...?
Yes, yes, Spock...
The ship... Out of danger...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... A cloaking device?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
You're right. Thanks for the drink.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Genesis, I want it.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
Yes... But -- how...?
Bones!...
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What you ask is difficult.
What I have done, I had to do.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
So! Speak!
Share this with no one.
Success, my lord.
Sir, may I suggest --
I ordered no interruptions.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
How can you tell that?
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
You amaze me, Commander.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
All true.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
You're not going in there -- !
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Until now.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Carol!
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Is that a poem?
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
David --
Jim --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
So are we, it looks like.
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
You're crazy -- !
I saw it -- !
I told you! I told you I saw a --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no... I should be on the bridge.
I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Yours... is... the superior...
Genesis, what's that?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Time's up, Admiral...
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
Admiral --
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! Nothing, sir.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Yes, SIR.
Is the word given?
The word is given: warp speed.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
How far?
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
The power of creation --
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual! Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Affirmative, Admiral.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
A distinct possibility.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
What IS working around here?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
That was a little joke.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Yes.
This is damned peculiar. Yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
All stop, sir.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Aye, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Prepare for warp speed.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Certainly...
You lied.
I do not understand the final question...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Fine. Just fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
No! No... What did you have in mind...?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure? That's what I thought.
Bones --
Bones, stay here.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
You're joking...!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally. So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
What's causing that!?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2. Come in, please...
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
Name?
My name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
No choice now, Scotty!
Yes, sir.
Ah, well done, team 2.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
I suppose they told you that...?
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Memory problems, too.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Go ahead.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Do you trust me?
Implicitly.
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Where could you take them?
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
What's what?
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
All right. The truth?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
You've programmed that from memory...?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
How do you know this...?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Yes.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Spock...
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
Exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
The hell I can't
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
Spock: Condition report!
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Systems report. Communications?
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
What is it?
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Any luck...?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Two?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
How long, Scotty?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The whales...?!
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I am well, Admiral.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
Hi.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Right on. You fly?
Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
You have warp capability?
Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
But not you.
There are days.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
What's the rush?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
You're what?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I understand.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Don't you ever get tired?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really?
Really.
Do machines ever play?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Chase me!
For what purpose?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
Anij!
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
The artificial lifeform was right?
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
A ship,
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Incomplete, I might add.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
How many?
I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
Understood.
You're not finished here?
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
May I talk to you alone?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Options?
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
I don't think they believe us.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
How long 'til they reach us?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Ask them.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Worf, you must hurry...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Captain...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir?
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Scanners are off line!
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir...
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
... Population three hundred million...
Say the greeting again...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
What...?
What you're doing to my neck...
No children?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh.
Augh?
All hands. Battle stations!
Initiate launch sequence.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana. Energize.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You actually performed surgery...?
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
No. I will not betray my friends.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Vulcan?
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
Dispersive armor is holding.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
Who are you?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
I told you, there's no --
Where?
What did you do to the batteries?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
This must be it.
How serious is the damage?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond.
Ready to make a little history?
Always am.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Captain --
No... the door's too thick.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
ATR setting...
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Great name. French?
Yes.
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
California. San Francisco.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
There is no invasion...
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
"Money." So you can get dome money...
What?
You're lying.
Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I'd say you already have.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
You're leaving, aren't you?
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No... I'm from France.
That's impossible.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Target locked!
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
I remember it made me sick.
What are you suggesting?
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Worf to Bridge.
Riker here.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Even Data?
Mr. President.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
Good luck, Captain.
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
You may need assistance, doctor...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Can you - ?
No!
Thanks...
Figures.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
If they're even looking for us...
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Stand...?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
He's a DOCTOR!
He just tried to save him!
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
Are those your words?
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Yes.
For insubordination.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
Where IS the conference?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Course heading, Captain?
They're preparing to fire.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Aye, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand down your weapons.
Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aft thrusters -
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Sorry -
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I hope you're happy.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Sir?
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Sulu!
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
WE volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's... ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
Never been this close.
What is it?
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
What the -
We HAVEN'T fired -
Captain...
The peace conference.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Why would they give them to us?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
What's she waiting for?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Captain --
WE SURRENDER.
Gorkon's own man??
Uhura?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You must have faith.
Faith...?
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
A lie?
A lie?
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
Direct hit -
Trouble?
What?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
What is it?
Praxis?
NO WAY!
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
A computer canna lie, sir.
I think not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That could take hours!
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
This one can.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
What exactly does that mean?
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
You are me.
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
Brother. I cannot move.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Is he very much like you were?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
How long does he have?
That was another time.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
He is very observant.
Data!
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
What do you imagine this is?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are being hailed.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Negative.
Why am I looking at me?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
You have a red shirt.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
An individual more like you, you mean.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
It appears to be... ... an arm.
Why is it moving?
It's you.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
Do you have a moment, sir?
I'm going to miss you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Cannon fodder.
What's he doing?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Sir?
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Sir, we're being hailed.
I'll take care of it, sir.
New Praetor?
Just lucky, Admiral.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
So, human... you've met your better self!
I won't do it.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
It's working.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Not very chatty.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Strength in numbers?
Report.
Anything.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
And the Senate supports you?
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
You don't trust me.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Looking up at the stars.
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You know that's not possible.
Long ago.
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
Please.
Its too late.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
What about Picard?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So theyve got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long?
How long until we reach the Rift?
What?!
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.
And?
How many Warbirds will you need?
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
You don't have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I have a purpose.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Praetor.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Right in line with that burning tree.
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
I don't think so...
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
How much are your rooms?
You have one with two beds?
Sure.
I'll take that.
Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
Credit card.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
I understand.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
Recognize this?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I don't like it, George...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Hello George.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
That's the chance we have to take.
No, we don't.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
What?
I just retired.
Mrs. Haydn...
This is George Fox...
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Mrs. Haydn...
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please...
Please.
Please...
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?!
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Good.
Which way?
What?
What?
What?
Pancakes.
What?
Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?
Smile.
Smile... good?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
No gas.
Gas good?
Go.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Closed?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Who are you?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
From?
Are you from up there? Space?
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
My... husband.
I am husband?
Shit.
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
No.
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What?
What is... ...Coke?
A drink.
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
It was yellow.
I will see it next time.
Why are you going here? What is here?
When do you have to be here?
I do not understand.
Sun...
Yes.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.
How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
I need you.
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Is that a baby?
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
Why?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
But I must go here.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
You want this ticket?
Yes.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Can I have the gun?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Go?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
Goodbye.
What?
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I understand.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
It's bad.
What are you doing?
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
Why?
I like this music.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Do you have music up there?
Yes.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
No. Get in.
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
Asshole!!
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
What?
Good morning.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
What for?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
The cook again?
Yes.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.
This is yours...
If you want to keep it, you can.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
You want the baby to laugh at me.
How long will it take you to get home?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
There.
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
What do I do now?
I love you.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
Help me!!
You could have killed us both!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
Help me!!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
In the cars, too?!
They after you?
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Tell him I'm not here.
You get that, Lyman?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Very beautiful country up here...
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.
Oh, Jesus.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
It was a man though... right?
Where are you going?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I told you...
You know that's impossible!
Is there a reward in this?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
You saw that?
Hello...
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
We can't let you do that.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.
No problem.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser. Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Fuck you.
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.
You can't just... kill him.
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything. Is it on?
Forget it's there.
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby. I've missed you.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
You talked to Iris? When?
I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
He has his uses too.
What? He gonna record you on his label?
Damn right.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there.
I have a gun. It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
What's going on?
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
I understand. No, I'm not.
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
What? Right Here?
Thanks, Max.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up--
You alright? Y'okay?
Yeah. No, not really.
Let's work it.
He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...
And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
So've I. Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
He's been cooked-off
Jesus.
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Okay... what about Strickland?
2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.
No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.
You just did.
Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
So there never was a death squad.
Naawww.
Give me six at least. This's a good clip, here. Gets you pumpin'.
Ha! That's for fucking sure.
Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.
Who was just here?
Iris, man. Pay attention.
I always do.
About what?
Nero.
Strickland.
Your sex life?
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--
Mace! You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
I need my case. It's still in the back.
So am I. Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Forget her.
She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that? Present from Faith?
What is it?
My God, Lenny. What is it?
Black. Jack.
And gives it to you.
Jesus, Mace. Back off.
Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
He knows what he's doing. He's worn before... a lot.
So that gives you something.
No more, Lenny.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
So the guy's not a sicko.
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
What is it?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Goddamnit!! 911 is busy!
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Those two guys were cops.
Tell me.
I can't tell you. You've got to see.
Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Well, look at the plus side.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
I'm not going.
I guess.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright. We're going up.
That's the original. There are no copies.
Take it to him.
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Are we under arrest?
Hey, Lenny. We made it.
Well... Get going. You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
Just Lenny.
Right. That explains it.
What is that?
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
You run the plates?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
What's the bad news?
Dylan here.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
What?
You have the body?
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
A grill pattern.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
You... surprised me.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Excuse me?
What are you...?
My God.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Yes.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
You have the photo from the diner?
He said it was a clue?
Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
What?
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
I think I talked to him.
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Miss me, Dave?
You are so fucked up.
Thanks for the ride.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
Not especially.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
Relax. J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
The other reason?
"Gone live?"
And one other thing.
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
Huh?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
And nobody else can do that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
Start killing people for real?
Suspect Zero.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You were right. He found me.
Does one exist?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
All the same killer?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I haven't changed anything. Damn.
I...
Jaime --
What happened?
Agent...
Kulok.
Unlock these cuffs.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Who are you?
Agent Mackelway?
Yes, sir.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I don't carry it with me.
It was the mall.
You? You went by the book?
Is he dead?
Yeah.
Was it Zero?
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Lead the way, Murman.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I want to help you.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Thomas Mackelway.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Koessler?
"MyDick?"
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Speck is dead.
How far is Amarillo?
350 miles.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Murman!
It's over for you.
Shit.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Are you calling Her?
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
You too?
Yeah.
I thought I was going to die.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
Like what?
What else?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything?
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Charles! What's up, man?
Oh. You know.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
What do you guys do?
On the table.
Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.
Huh?
You want this in black chips.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
No...
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Well, who represents you back east?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Sorry, it's just that...
Well... This is it.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
Well, I should be getting...
...It's really getting late.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
Hi. Sorry about that.
How's it going? It's been a while...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good. I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Hi.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
You don't call.
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
Right.
Well that sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't want to say anything.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Kinda.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
I do. Good for you, man.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
How many strokes?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight.
What'd you get?
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks...
Bud.
Darwinism at its best.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Ah, there's the rub...
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
I just tested for one...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
There are so many beautiful women here.
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Thanks, man.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
You miss the pain?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
Make someone bleed.
Pause it.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
What's he do?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Who threw this party, anyway?
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
She was cute.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
Coffee... Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
S'up Trent?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Wait.
What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Whu?
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
They're all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
That's where we make our scene.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Nice, baby.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
I hope so. We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
I'm Mike... and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
No!
No! Not the camera guy!
No, man. I need to use the phone.
What?
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
Christy was nice...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She was hot.
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No. Doesn't that suck?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
How you guys doing?
It's on.
Which one?
What are you doing?
What?
You looked right at her, baby.
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
We got the digits, baby.
What a surprise.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
A day.
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking at me, baby?
No.
Now?
No.
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
You think?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...we're not...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...shivering...
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Anaheim...
...Sue...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
It's on...
It's on.
It is on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good. He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
No. You ask for too much.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Be my friend.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
Barzini.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You're staying home. You're not going out.
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
You heard about your father?
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You take care of Paulie?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Are you worried about security for your million?
No.
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
When did he call?
Should I bring him in.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country. It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
Have you thought about a wife? A family?
No.
I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No, I wanted other things for you.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Barzini will move against you first.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
What is it?
You tell us about America.
How do you know I come from America?
We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
Hey, beautiful girls!
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty. Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike! The party starting!
Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
And when they shot me father...
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. He's been asking for you.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
How will they come at you?
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes. Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
And what do you want for Christmas?
What time do they expect us?
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
No.
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Hello. Kay?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
I can't...
Please say it.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
I don't think so either. I better go.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
Oh Michael.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
I'm busy.
Will you?
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, Sonny. All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
We're going to New Jersey?
What is it?
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Just be patient.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
He talked to you?
Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
Buy me out?...
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.
You think I scam?
Yeah.
Do you recognize my voice?
How do you do.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Well, we ate everything without you.
We?
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay. And did we know each other?
It's just an undercoat.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I met him in New York.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I'm never going back!
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
I played piano in a few places.
Do you have any brothers?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
What does he say?
Relax.
Freddie?
Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
So tell me.
Oh God, I don't think so.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
I love Marge.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you.
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Hello?
Dickie?
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
You should watch that!
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Hardly.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Mr Greenleaf.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Such as?
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Frances?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you -- so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he really not here?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie did it.
What?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
Look at me what?
Very.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I told you. He gave them to me.
Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.
So you found Peter...
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
What's your secret?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
Emily. Just kidding.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Randall.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I know.
Show me the other one again. I like them both.
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, my God!
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
A ragione. A ragione.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
Will we see you later?
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
What rumour?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one.
What did he say?
He's already angry, I don't think --
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Peter, I... I...
You're such a liar...
Dickie Greenleaf?
Yes?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
Thank you.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have!
You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.
Nah, this'll be fine.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
You like ball games?
Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Yes?
My name is Travis.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Huh?
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
What are you doing?
I bought a couple of tickets.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
Keep it.
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
You forgot "sexy".
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Ouch!
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Is he Italian?
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Yeah.
You said that?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
For a fee.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
Huh?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.
You carry a piece? You need one?
20 bucks?
Hello.
You looking for some action?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
A girl needs protection.
What's your name?
Easy.
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
Why? Who are you?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
I don't remember.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
Listen...
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
Well, I tried.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
Pittsburgh.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Who's a killer?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
How?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
What do you mean?
Have you tried the telephone?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean. As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
No.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Why do you ask?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
Is that so?
You would, huh?
Your name Sport?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop. I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
I'm no cop.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Wha -- ?
Get it.
Travis.
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Real down.
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right. I seen enough to know.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Could we change the subject?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Hey! Now there's some good news.
Stick with Carla.
Don't stop... do no stop.
No.
Maybe. Not really.
Thank you.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir. I'm tired.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
I'm a field agent.
I don't understand....
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Motor oil?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del. Goodspeed follows him.
I.don't get it. You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
I'll go.
Wrong.
What, vou?
What are you doing?
Wait.
Mason. Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed? Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
Partners?
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew? All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
God's speed.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas. Front pew. Right leg. = Hollow.
Hi.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
I believe you.
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
I wish you were coming with me.
Did you bring along something to read?
Dad?
How'd it go?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I think it's worse now.
Well...
You mean, me?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
Do you... remember me?
What.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Me too.
You look... different.
You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
You first.
Why me?
How'd they get it inside?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
And why not?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
Nothing.
Do you have the...
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Oh...
This is strange. Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
I don't smoke?
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Exactly. And he got good.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
Your dancing's very good.
I see...
Delly, shhhhhh...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I do.
Yes. A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Only one in town. Get in, son.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god...
Yes.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No. But...
But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Or the Bijou. Either one.
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Good to meet you. Again.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son. Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
Mother. She's beautiful.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh. What... what time is it?
Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Yes?
Ernie.
Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You bet.
Well...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Dad, I...
Ha!
... what?
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
The film broke...
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
What.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sandra Sinclair.
Nope. Can't. We're through.
Then I'll call you a cab.
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Here, one of mine.
It's possible. I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
What is it?
Call me... Ishmael?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
You kids off to the dance?
Aren't you coming?
You smell gas?
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Jesus.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
What's his rent?
Huh?
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I was decorated.
I know. A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
You can't testify.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
It's wrong, Leo.
That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.
Not at all.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Well, that's not what they think.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
When was that?
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
Sit. Play with me.
No, I...
What?
Is there a young Tim?
No.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
Cat.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
That's my r-r-rent.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
The customers? I don't know...
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Oh.
It's about me.
Oh...
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
I suppose. Thanks.
The war...
You hungry, son?
Yes. Very.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
Who?
My girlfriend. If she still is...
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No. Absolutely not.
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
Mmm. Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
I was wondering...
Yes?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Different?
With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Is anyone there?
Look.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
I don't know, honey.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
What?
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Thank you.
Yep. Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
No. Here's fine.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?
How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Tell him about the party.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
When?
I don't know when. We'll see what...
Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
Mitch...
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
I can handle it.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I started to say... inside...
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Yes.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes.
He's not home.
Monday?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I wonder if you could help me.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I didn't break that window!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I think you're a louse.
I am. Good day. Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What made it...
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Ouch!
I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
What for?
To see a friend of mine. Will you please be careful?
I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
Why...
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Oh, no you don't!
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Yes.
I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
Right next to the one you already had.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
I wrote the letter.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I'd still like to see you.
Why?
It is for me.
But not for me.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Helping travelers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
So they united.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Take wing!
What it was, probably...
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Don't let's take any chances.
The town looks clear.
The bay doesn't.
Do you want to try your father again?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
And he'll talk?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm not sure, but...
How do you plan to do that?
Scotch, light on the water.
Birds?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Of course.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Ask this one favor --
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But that's long since. Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
He's not home.
Where can I find him?
At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Well? And are you not a good student?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
Gray killed her.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes. I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
No.
What?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.
Why, yes.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He was a nice horse.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Come, Toddy -- come. Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
I am the best man for the job.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
It might be an interesting case.
Toddy hates me.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I have other means of sustenance.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
What did you hear?
Yes.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Only Brother.
You and I should work together.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair. The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
And why not? He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Tell her... we'll get him.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
You think I'm crazy.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
I think we should get some support?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
Keep that thing away from me.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
The scar. Which of you has it?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
How can you die if you're already dead?
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
I know her friends.
Yeah, no kidding.
He didn't kill her.
How do you know?
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No! Why are you haunting me?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Erin. It's not your fault.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
So you're going to kill him?
My father.
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
... it connects you to me...
Yeah, we do.
I know.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
Could say that.
Fucking crow.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Maybe we had a case of that here. Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I do. Every day.
Anything wrong?
What's with your friend there?
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Honey. I just can't.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin!
Are you ok?
What is it?
What? What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
About you.
Sweetheart...
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
I don't believe you.
Please. Come inside.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I leave that in your hands.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Such power exists?
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Hi Mom!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Yes, I have!
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Go to the movies.
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I don't believe it.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I can judge only by what I see.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Well, we could--
It was a wonderful day.
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
He's not there. But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Is that what you're thinking about?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so--
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
May I see you for a minute?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Yes--?
I want to know what he told you last night.
What happened?
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Why not?
It must be twelve-thirty.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Where is the meeting going to be?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
I -- I thought you were--
I was.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
But how -- how long--?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
But I suppose you know the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Well, how do I know who you are?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
All day.
Can't stand light?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Yeah.
Why not?
He's my brother.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
All together?
Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star. Climb on.
I can't beat a Triumph.
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What?...
Don't! Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
Where you going?
For a ride.
With him?
C'mon, Michael. I want to go.
Leave him alone.
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Or a vampire.
Bad breath? Long fingernails?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
What?
No, Nanook! Quiet!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Of course not!
David.
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there! Stop him!
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good. When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.
Good!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so. She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
Sure.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Michael!...
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
Help me, Mom. Help.
He met a girl.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Lights out, Sam.
Sam. Is everything all right?
Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong? Tell me.
Where's Michael?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan. The Frog Brothers.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no. Now what?
Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now!
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
Mom!
I'm not looking for a tape. What I need is --
-- a job.
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max! What's wrong?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
Are you following me?
Well, I...
Well... yeah. Sure.
Okay. Talk.
Hi...
What's your name?
Star.
Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
Now you and David...
No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you. Please wake up.
Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
Why not?
Because I love you...
I know, I've felt it...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Take laddie.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone. I feel it!
What!? He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?! No fair!!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night? You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
No. Why?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening.
Piss off.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What about Mom?
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Star.
Who are you calling?
Michael! Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five knots.
Maybe dinner.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
Yeah.
Well, where was he? Where did he go?
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
So what's our problem?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Anybody sick?
Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
What you doin'?
Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
How you doin', old boy?
Watch Clark.
What?
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime. Anywhere.
Let's open it.
Let's open it. Now...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where? Where'd you go?!
Was dark... find a light...
Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?!
I'm working it! Nothing's happening!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it. I can't find it!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Cut him loose?
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
The dogs?
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
But...
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
What are you doing?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What clothes?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
What for?
You ain't tying me up.
Then I'll have to kill you.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
Spaceship of some kind.
I think so.
Not the only one.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
What are you doing?
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
Well, who's got access to it?
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Thank you.
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
How long will it take you to prepare this?
A couple of hours.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
When was the last time you used it?
I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How many in their party?
Right. Why not?
Hey, man...!
Put that down!
No.
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
Four!
What's...
Oh, I got you. Not too long.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez...? Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We going to make it?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
He's dead.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
This storm do that?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
You jerking off or just pissed?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
It's the generator I think! No power.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
Ah... no.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
And everyone looks like us?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Where?
What kind of stories?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
Yes. Just about here.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
1899.
I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
Please, we need your help. The Morlocks have taken --
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
But you escaped.
I was lucky. The others weren't.
Because you'll never die.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
This is the way in?
In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying?
Machines?
Yes.
Vox?
What's it all for?
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
What do you mean?
No...
This has to end.
End...?
Vox --
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking... ... For a while anyway.
I don't understand.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
What's your name?
Alexander.
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.
How?
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above. Became what they are.
What?
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
Why?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.
A man can change his history.
Now will you go?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm tired of running.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then. We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers.
What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Admiration? My my.
I mean... well... affection.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I know it's not a diamond but --
A moonstone.
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
They are rare... ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
In the future, we'll be better.
What?
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex. Very much.
I live with it every minute of every day.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
Did you hear me, lad?
You're up! You must be feeling better --
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Your husband is dead?
You're not from beyond the valley.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Oh, that explains everything.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?
Why?
Why not?
Is he all right?
I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams? That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
... It was a great city. The greatest city in the world.
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was... ... Most of the time.
Alexander...?
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
This is where my journey started... right here.
You lost someone.
Yes.
Is it?
Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together...
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Mara --
Kalen...
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Do you have it?!
Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit. You can go.
May I get you some --
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Yes, sir.
And hungry, I'd say. You had such a long journey.
I did...
"Eloi"?
What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
No...
He said he traveled for two months.
Why?
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I am the oldest.
No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
We don't know.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back.
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Then it's time to change that --
You won't even try?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home. Will you take me?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
And you've no idea where he went?
You ok?
I'm fine.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
In where?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
And what's that?
My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
That's too bad.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You done with your small talk?
Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Why?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What for?
I think I can remember what's on them.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Beat] What?
I looked it up.
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I know.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
Me, too.
You're sure?
They're not here.
They're not.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
William, you're not making sense.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
I think so.
How you doin'?
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
My God you look exactly like him.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
What case?
How'd he get it?
[Beat] I don't know.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
Exactly.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What do you mean?
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
The future doesn't look different?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
Who...who kills me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
What are you talking about?
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I tried to kill my wife.
What were you talking about the other day?
I wasn't talking about anything.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Beat] How do you know?
It's gonna be sticky.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
Sure.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
What's this?
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Well, good for you.
[Beat] Why?
You don't think that's crazy?
This is a great song.
So you never knew your mother?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Hon.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
What?!
'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
Darryl.
What?
Honey?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Who's the nut?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Alright! She did good! Didn't she?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Who do you think did it?
I've been better.
You girls are in some hot water.
We're both fine.
Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Hey.
How are things goin' out there?
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
No!
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Tell us about him.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Armed robber.
What kind of gun was it?
A .38.
Good God.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't. I'm married. I don't feel good. I've been sick.
Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...! Um, where ya going?
I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Oh. I... where's Louise?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope. I've never robbed a bank.
God. You're a real live outlaw!
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer. Same goes double for me.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
I always knew that.
Louise! Where are you? Are you alright? Honey...
Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
I am funny. I'm real funny.
Do you love me?
Christ, sure... yes!
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Call me back.
Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.
I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you, okay?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.
What?
Hey, peaches.
Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
Hello...
Who is it?
Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one thing?
Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now. I'm not kiddin'!
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Will you at least see how it fits?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Is this your car?
Yes.
In the back?
Front.
Am I in trouble?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me. Hi. What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.
Okay. I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern. The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be? I'm hungry.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Maybe.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Oh my God.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
Shit! I... I, which way?
Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
We gotta be inconspicuous. Do you know what that means?
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
I'm cash poor.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
Give me the keys.
Did you finish thinking?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Will I be?
It's probably not a good idea.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
Yup. That's him goin'. I love to watch him go.
How do I look?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
Taking a shower.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Don't worry about it. You want anything?
Drive! Drive away!
I'm sorry. Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Okay. Shit, Thelma! What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
Try to.
Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?
Thelma.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
It won't work.
Fill her up. There's a phone right over there.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
Louise? Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what?
Now what what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
You mean now or before?
What little dogs?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
This is so beautiful.
Gosh. It sure is.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
What?
Nothing. It's not funny.
What?!
Harlan.
What?! What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Thelma!
What?
Sorry!
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
You know why. You already said.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Louise?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
He said they're charging us with murder.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.
You awake?
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
Me too. I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Oh my God! Louise! Look! Look! See if that's him!
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
Hey. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
You know what's happened, don't you?
What?
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
Shit!
What?!
What?! What d'you think?!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Louise!
What?!
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God! It looks like the Army!
Now what?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
What? What are you talkin' about?
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Say you're sorry.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
Hi there! You alright?
We're fine! How are you?
Where you goin'?
Oh, Jesus!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
No, I just meant...
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
You sent that?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm asking you to leave.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Nah.
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
No You mean...?
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Dom? What are you?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
So... I see you made the news.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
'That right?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Here's the info you asked for.
Stalker, huh?
Very nice.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Nineteen months I been sober.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
So where the hell are you, Healy?
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
What's that?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
I know he's around here someplace.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
So...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Uh-huh.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't buy it.
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
I think your life's about to change.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
No, not at all.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
What are you doing?
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Good good.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Harvard?
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You little fuck.
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
I'd go with the seven.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
So who's the lucky guy?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?
What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
An old flame?
Holy shit...
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Where's Puffy?
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Can I pour you one?
What's up?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
So who you taking to the prom?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
You asshole, what are you -- Mary! Is that you?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
And did everything -- ?
Really? I never got a message.
By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
What's that?
Hm?
Sure.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
What are you?
Twenty-two.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Yeah?
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over. We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Go!
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.
Really?
Yeah? What do you want?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Teddy, hon, are you okay? OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Oh God.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't trying --
No! I was pissing!
Hey.
So what's up?
Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
Piggyback ride.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Tomorrow...
Good.
Well, I'm not.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
The other thing is...
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Oh, still sore about this.
My father --
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
And?
Slow down. Smell that?
Smoke.
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Then they should speak up.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
The sun came up today.
Yeah.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
That is correct.
And the second condition?
John. How much time?
Max.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Still heading for Cuba.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Secretary of Defense...
Dean Rusk!
Hey, sport. You winning?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
What about you? Where are you going?
I was eating that.
No you weren't.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
Yeah.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Rug samples.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
I see.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Mr. Clear Moon.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
What are you doing?
James Looks Twice?
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray. French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
What journey?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
I did.
Who the fuck is he?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Go ahead.
Meet me at base. Over.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Let's see it.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?
When did we get that?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'll sleep around a little.
Thanks, Cooch.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
She's that subtle?
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
What?!
Bullshit.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You've got no jurisdiction.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
He knows me?
What did he say?
He said he doesn't know.
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
And...
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
I can't do that, It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
What you call myths, we call our history.
It's not real.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
Still after Jimmy?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
What's that?
1868...
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
So they took care of Leo.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He's gone.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
X22. Read.
Come back?
Ray. X22.
I read, Cooch.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
At Sioux Falls Pen?
No, that was Leavenworth. This -- was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
It isn't?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Yeah, most likely.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
How did you know this was my car?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
That's all!
I beg your pardon.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
Two.
Two miles.
The what?
It never came up.
No.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
And far too aggressive.
For what?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Apology acknowledged.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Um. You.
There you go with those moves again.
Too aggressive?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I can't.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
The what?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What are you talking about?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Harmless!
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
How about what?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What about the plane?
Used to what?
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
Make what?
Anything.
It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
No!
It's not suffering anymore.
You don't have to kill it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
It's just as I thought.
You're totally insane.
Come on.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
And now?
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
Anything.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why?
Food...and you...my F-14!
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
I'm still second best.
You ever fly an F-14?
Danger?
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Lucky charm.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
...they say you're alright.
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
No.
What do you want?
I want it back.
What?
That's what I want.
You don't believe that.
Hardly ever.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
What do you do when you come here?
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
How do you play reality.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Want to play the game?
What truth?
Goose is dead.
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
What does it mean?
That's three.
One more.
Looks like a tie.
Who's gonna win?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I know exactly what you mean.
Well?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
Well... What is it?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Well?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Can't shake him.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
MAVERICK.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
That's missile lock!
He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What? What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
I'm pulling up.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
What are you doing?
Saving them some paperwork.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT! CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Ohhh Mother!
Don't WORRY!!!? You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it? Have you still got it?
Yawing right.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
I've got it -- hold on!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
No! Not again!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man.
280, 290, 300 knots.
3,000 feet. We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is there something I should know?
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
You're not supposed to...
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Well what?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Did what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So's my Johnson.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
You think you can stay up with us.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
How was it?
What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
You ever done this before?
We did it!
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
It's a victory roll.
Come on, we're next.
What?
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
Time to go.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
1000.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
What'd you do?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Well, he's going and he needs someone to fly the plane.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
Hear about Ice?
What now?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
GET LOST!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT.
I guess I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
Figured it out yet?
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Nope.
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Just below ten thousand.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
Who's the hell is that?
Three guesses.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
You won?!!!
It was bad.
Bad?
You didn't help.
Morning, Coogan.
Was going. Now you are.
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
How do you feel?
All right.
Goose is dead.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
No bother.
I called your house.
Or....
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Over there man.
Welcome to Mars.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
The Last Resort.
First time on Mars?
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man. Goes with the territory.
What happened to them?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort. Sure you wanna go in?
Lemme ask you a question. Ever fuck a mutant?
Need a ride?
Shut up and drive!
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this? You're a mutant.
Don't bother looking. It's in your skull.
How'd you find me?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Hmm. It seems you left something in our safe.
Get it, please.
I'll go encode your room key.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker. Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
What the fuck is going on down there?!
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
We can't let him run around. He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
He had help. From our side, sir.
I know that.
Yes, sir.
Stop fighting and get out.
They've got Quaid! They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Kill him.
Bob?
What is it?
I'm with an very important client.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Good evening... Doug. I'm Dr. Lull.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Eight years.
I see. Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Hetero.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy? Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
What do you want?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm listening.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Amazing. Where are we?
She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Quaid! That's Quaid!
Where?
HER!
Richter! Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony. Give the big guy a break.
Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Yeah.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
What, aliens?
You tell me.
You're Kuato, right?
Shit!
They found us! Everybody out!
Hey Harry...Harry! You ever heard of Rekall?
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
I don't know. Maybe.
Why not?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
No shit...
Hey, Quaid!
Harry!
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
Yeah, you did. I told you not to but you did anyway.
What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
I don't blame you man. I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Where is he?
Level 2. Galleria.
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock! There!
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry. Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Welcome to JohnnyCab. Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.
Is that better?
Mmmm.....
Who?
The brunette. The one you told me about.
Who is she?
Nobody.
Nobody?! What's her name?
I don't know.
It's not funny, Doug. You dream about her every night.
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
And you believe him?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody. You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
Muggers?! Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know! It had something to do with Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Let me finish!
What did they do to you? Tell me!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk! I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
You think I'm an idiot? Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
Implanted.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Clever girl.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
Now help me out here, Doug. You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
Right. Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.
How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.
They'll be here any minute! They'll kill you all!
What's he talking about?
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Blondes.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I guess he didn't.
...What?
I don't remember you.
What are you talking about?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser? You're Hauser.
She wasn't really my wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside.
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I said get out!
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
I used to model for 'em, why?
Not bad, for a hooker.
What can I do?
Like what?
All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Are you all right? Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air. But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
I gave you?
Wait!
What?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
You stupid punk! You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to do?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
That's four. Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
You can't fight'em that way...
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Knock it off, Burt!
What do you think? Max firepower or...?
A beauty, isn't it? We bought three of them for the rec room.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency. I'm on forty-nine.
Let's go you two. We're headed for the mountains.
That's fine. We've got some new things to teach them.
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it! They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Where the hell are they? Hope they didn't wise up.
Hi, guys. Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs. I did eggs.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood.
We did it! We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
You're full of shit.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh, Jesus!!
Jesus! I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us. That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Relax. A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Car's gone. We just missed them, that's all.
Shut up! They got wind of something they don't like!
What the hell are they?
This is one big mother!
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
We'll take your word for it.
Prairie dog burrow...
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours. Maybe it's long gone.
Maybe it is. Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
You go north, I'll go south.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Wait a minute...the Cat. Could we take the Cat?
Jesus. It's slower than hell.
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Like hell you are.
Get real. I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, everybody! We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Well...that's it. We're not getting off this rock...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!
Use the fucking bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man! LIGHT IT!!
<u>People</u>? Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Sell the movie rights. We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
Somebody paying you to do this?
What?
She likes <u>both</u> of us. We both helped her out.
How's she doing?
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
We playing cards tonight?
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt! Heather!
Yeah, Val.
We're here, Val. Just tell us what you need. Come back.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
I'm dead. Let's finish in the morning.
The con...! Oh my God.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
Well, what's wrong with it?
You sure this is where it was?
Come on. Get away from it!
Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you think?
And I appreciate it.
I don't believe this. The phone is out! Pham, your phone is out!
Twenty.
Hi, I'm Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Around here? Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations...
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
Ready?
You paying attention? This oughta hurt like hell.
What's it doing?
Yeah, they're confused. They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!! Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right? Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Wait! How are you going to know they're all following it?
It worked! There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
True.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I have to talk to your brother.
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
I noticed.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can describe it.
You can't remember that -- !
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not the whole time, of course. I --
We had a description of the suspect.
You're implying that I planted a gun?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Of course.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
-- an angel dust dealer --
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- a speed manufacturer --
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
You really think that's what happened?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
What, the lunatic who --
Do you have to do that?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie Dowd.
1530 Rivington Street.
-- What?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
So what're we gonna do?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
I'm not that desperate.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
-- What?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
...Jesus!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Murder witness.
You're doing a murder case?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I embellished.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I embroidered.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
-- Find him?
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I haven't paid you.
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
My mother find you?
That's right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
No.
...I'm dying out there.
It was self-defense.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
See-cil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
Y-yes, sir.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
No, s-sir.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Edward T. Dowd.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- alleged crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
You getting this?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Shouldn't one of us...?
What do you want?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
I followed you here from court.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Look. Mister --
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Five years.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And its purpose?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars... PCP, crack...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Soldado.
Shu's the only one I know of...
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
A woman.
What color hair will she have?
Blonde.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No.
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike. Is this Mike?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit... We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
An old woman and her grandson.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Did she have someone with her?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
You try that you little monkey.
Yes...
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
What is it, Gordon?
HE'S GONE.
What?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Teresa Banks.
Anything else?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
Any friends?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.
That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Sort of shorthand.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
How do you figure?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
A blue rose.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
That's good.
Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Accidental?
Agent Desmond, it's...
It's late, Sam.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
You didn't do your homework?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
James called me last night looking for you.
When?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is? You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Laura?
Donna, are you my best friend?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Do you want to talk?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
No place, fast. And you're not coming.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
What are you doing?
No. I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I won't wear your stuff. I promise.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
I can't help you there.
But I love you, Laura.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Why do you do it, Laura?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
Nice night.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Who would do that?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
What does Bob say?
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
No... No...
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
Hey, Jacques...
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
Right on time, baby.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
James...
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Laura, do you love me?
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
We were supposed to be together.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
James...
I've got to see you.
Not now.
This afternoon?
Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
Bobby killed a guy.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
You want to see...
Boating?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
Josie, I think we should go public.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Fish eyes?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I understand.
Can I take the car?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
I hate asparagus.
Where's Dad?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Fine.
School?
...school's fine...
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Let me see.
Dad...
Who was that?
A friend from school.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
No.
We're late to get to your mother.
Are you sure you're okay?
Dad?
Yes.
Did you come home during the day last week?
No.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe? "I'm hungry".
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What are you doing?
Who am I?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I do. Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Yes.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand...
Dr. Thompson...?
That's what I'd planned to...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Dr. Gruber...
I read the hospital report on your client.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Thank you...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Thank you.
You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Laura.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ?
What...?
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe... Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
No... no...
Is it over?
No.
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Alito, please.
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Hi, Mickey...
What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...?
Uh...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
What?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
That's right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
The 'History'...?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
...yeah... good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
That won't start no more fires. We might's well go home.
Yeah. No sense stayin' out here.
It's an enemy sneak attack. Let's get outta here!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, there - open up!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Hey, you! Better get outa here!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
Hurry up! Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it! Do you have a match?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I do know him...slightly.
What's he like?
They've all stopped at the same time.
How does it happen cars are running?
Can you handle one of these?
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus. I haven't any family.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
It was... ...one of them!
What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Very futuristic. Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one. You know why?
Yes ... Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us.... ...for as long as anybody's got!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
This Martian blood... Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman! Did you get those biotics?
I got a message for you. You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
So is the town, I notice!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
They don't do much of anything...!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Must be somebody in there.
Who? Where d'you think they come from!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
What'll we say to 'em?
They'll understand us, all right!
Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.
He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.
You mean that was a...
So?
So I don't know about horror.
Come on. Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Yes, but...
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't know. A couple months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
I don't follow.
Just an earthquake, Dylan. Every once in a while we get a few.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts What?
You get any sleep last night?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
No, you don't.
What if it isn't over?
Guess so.
Heather?
What's up?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Yes.
I'll be there in three hours.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
No.
Diabetes?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.
Doctor...
DO you mind...
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
No way he's going anywhere. He's been well sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
no.
You going away?
Someone's coming.
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Rex saved me.
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
Tomorrow night.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Who?
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
He's on his way.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
I can't sleep there, Mommy. Please!
In my bed.
Your bed?
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home.
You okay, champ?
Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man's getting awful close.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought. We really got you, didn't we?
Darker. More...evil?
Yeah...how'd you know?
What...happened?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
You didn't jump in.
That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.
Seemed, not was.
Freddy, for all I know.
John Saxon. Do you have any idea what time it is?
John. It's Heather. I need help!
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
I want to see the body.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Studio B.
Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
No. I...listen, I can't make it in today.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Listen, dammit.
Heather, what is it?
No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
What's that?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured, sometimes.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dylan. And... Chase. My God, Wes, did you know?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Choice? What kind of choice?
No, not really. I...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Yes?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present. The car will bring you.
Now?
Can I get you something to drink?
Black's fine.
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
You may not like what you hear.
I can take it.
Why did we begin this?
I haven't forgotten.
Phil, he's not looking inside. He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Hey! Weigh! Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Weight! Hey! Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Yes, Sir.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Carry on.
Yes sir.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
What do you mean?
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Fine.
Albatross?
Yeah.
Rick March. Who the hell are you?
She isn't that old.
What do you mean?
Where you going?
I cheated to get on the boat!!! All right?!
Bregitta. Do you believe it?
Believe what?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
It's a ninety-one! It's an 'A'!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
What was that?
Figured what out?
You know, I never had friends like this.
Me either.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
He does.
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man. I think he broke my nose!
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Why'd you do it?
What's the difference?
Can we talk?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
We all have problems.
But that's not the point...
Do you have your ticket?
Yes.
Passport?
Goodbye Mom. I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
Fine.
I feel like I got you into this.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
No way!
So... What happened?
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio. How 'bout you?
Who told you that?
My dad.
That's how he died you know.
Jesus, you never told them?
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Uh, huh.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
What's on your mind?
Well, spit it out.
Can't do it.
Sir...?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
I don't know.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
Stow away?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?
No.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
I'm Francis Boutillier. This is my son, Philip.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
We'll do our best. You're welcome to say goodbye.
And, of course, we are.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me. Eat it anyway.
Spying?!
I can take care of myself.
It has nothing to do with him.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Who is it Philip?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
You do?
What?! What's happening?!!
You're officer of the watch, George.
Son-of-a-bitch.
What's that?
Immortality.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
What's that?
Jesus. She's got guns.
That's enough.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Me, too.
Jesus! What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
Why'd you jump?
Because I felt like it. What do you care?
I couldn't do it.
Don't ever call me stupid.
I'll read it. I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
How would you know?
Trust me donut. I know.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
Why, man?
I don't.
What?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Well, that was neighborly.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
What do you think?
We've got a problem.
What's that?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
You gotta be kidding? He's a human chum line!
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man. It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
Phil. What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior. I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil. Not like this.
It's outta here!
Do you have something to say?
No.
No, sir.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
What?
What's it going to be?
I'm sorry...
What are you blubbering about?
Don't look down. Look in my eyes! Climb! We'll do it together.
Are you hating this?! Are you!
He climbed when he was ready.
No.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall". With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
I understand.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
It wasn't hard.
I used to helm a school ship. A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Easy for you to say.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
This be it?
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
I'm from all over.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Sorry to hear it.
You black?
No.
You an indian?
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
Have now.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What's she doin' here?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
No shit?!?! You know him?
Used to.
What'd you say?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Oh, many things...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
The Good Witch...
Sailor... Lula loves you.
...Asshole.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
What is it, Johnnie?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You won't of missed much.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Nothin', honey. Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
And?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
What's that honey?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Sailor?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
...are followin' him around.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What's that?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
So?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Sailor!
You mean like pedal pushers?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What kinda trash talk is that?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Come look at this.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
It's just another case, Sailor.
What's that, peanut?
You got me, peanut.
You certain?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Where?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
You ready for this?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Uh huh.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
How much we got left, honey?
Under a hundred.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
My mama... So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
What's that?
Oh God, Sailor.
One bad car accident...
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
And no AC.
Fan works.
Now what?
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Sailor?
Yeah?
That you, Sail, honey?
You sick?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
You been drinkin', huh?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Six.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Oh God! What does that mean?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
I knew you'd want it again...
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Take care of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You need to explain it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Santos...
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
Yes.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
See! I knew you had it all under control.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Put your shoulders back.
What?
You got nice tits.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
No...
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No.
Whattya mean?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I didn't see nothin'...
I know... I remember.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You snore.
So I hear.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
Tripp!
How are you, Crabtree?
Emily?
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's a transvestite.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I thought you were tinkering.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
He has a book.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
Tripp.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
You stay there.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
How bad is it for you?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Which is?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
What's to tell?
So modest.
So sensitive.
Crabtree.
Is he awake?
Shut up, James.
So what's the problem?
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
So -- what do we do now?
Find the jacket.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Such as.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
That was MacCaulay.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
In a sense.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Me? What can I do?
You peeked, didn't you?
You driving this car?
Excuse me?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
It's mine.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
I passed out.
You did.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Do you think that's why I've been having these... ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
And your wife left you.
She told you about...
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
Vernon.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Who the hell is that?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
Hello?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
With Emily?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
...reconcile with Emily.
Goodbye, Grady.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
No! What gave you that idea?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
Well...
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
You cold, James?
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Go ahead.
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Yea, James.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Miss Sloviak's.
Can I ask you something about her?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Thank you.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
I put you on the floor.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Want me to get that?
He didn't give his name.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd you tell him?
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Washed up?
Blocked.
Professor Tripp?
Hm.
How's that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
But James. I mean... How long?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Who?
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Humboldt County?
Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Where's that?
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
What kind of dancer?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Kinship.
Kinship. And what's here?
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Jealous? Of me?
You're lying.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
You coming?
Want a bite?
No thanks.
What would you call them then?
It's because you don't eat.
I eat.
When?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Get out of here.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, James.
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
So what are you going to do?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Hey.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Jesus.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
But where? I need the street.
He cribbed that from Borges.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
That good, huh?
Professor Tripp.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
You go first.
All right. This morning --
I'm sure.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Emily left me this morning.
She's left before...
Is that Cristaile?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Is the thing -- is it over?
Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter?
Well...
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Not have it.
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
You got me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I heard.
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
Who's that sitting in your car?
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
Sara.
Inside.
And the jacket?
Someone stole my car.
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
You don't deserve me, you know.
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Why yes. How did you know?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, Antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Walter?
Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
No.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Where you stand?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
A jockey? You mean, like --
Hardapple?
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
The perpetrator.
No, the dog.
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, James?
George Sanders?
There's so many...
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You want to keep him happy.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
You doing okay?
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
What are you doing?
Cherry.
Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It was a beautiful present.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
It wasn't like that.
What's happening?
What party?
I've got some pictures. Want to see?
No thanks.
Ah, come on.
I've got some good news.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
You don't have to tell me this.
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
There's little chicks! You want to see?
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I can't.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
I have friends.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I'm not pretty.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
You don't know?
I have no idea.
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Cherry?
Yeah.
It's not for sale.
Okay?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
No.
Neither do I. What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
You knew her?
What?
You don't know?
Know what?
I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I was asleep.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
I could take you downtown.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas. May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
What?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
Yeah, like the bird.
Can I ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.
Walter.
Do you have many friends?
No.
It sounds like you were banished.
Robin?
Yes?
What?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
They sound like finches.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Does he?
Yes.
What's her name?
Ms. Kramer.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I can't.
But will he... ?
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
I know because... it's just something I know.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
Yes?
No.
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
And how's your job?
The job's okay.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
I said the job is okay.
That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I don't understand.
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
It's okay.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Honest? No.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Forget it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel anything.
You have no feelings for your niece?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
I don't.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
I want to be normal!
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
You don't know!
I don't know.
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Is this the first one?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
When did it all start?
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
No, I am not going to --
I don't see --
Who do you see?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Not so fast.
Sorry. Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Where are you?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
Just lying there. We're taking a nap.
A nap?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Don't ever do that again.
All right.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
This is garbage!
What else?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
I was six years old!
It was a small house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
It's going to take time, Walter.
Time.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Very weird.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
I'm just quiet.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Is that a school?
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about bears?
What about them?
They could eat you.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What?
Something happened to you.
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
So?
What?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
What's the problem?
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Tell me about it.
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
Sorry.
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
What was prison like?
You don't really --
Sounds like a special guy.
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.
You know, this is crazy.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
I got poked around... here and there.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
What?
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
We should live together.
Live together.
It's a bad idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I'm not scared.
Don't do that.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
I didn't sleep well.
Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?
Yeah.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud.
Right through the brainpan. Deader'n dogshit, boss.
She went front-office on you. Tighten that for me, right there. That's it.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
How you guys doing?
You got it?! You got it?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you read, over? This is Deepcore--
Nice shot, Lins.
Okay so far.
Where are we?
Lord Almighty.
I'm taking you back out.
Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?
I can't believe you let them do this!
Your rig?
I'm switching off now.
Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What happened?
Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?
No.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous.
Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed.
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Try again.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Son of a bitch!
Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here.
How?
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
I know! I know! But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, lady.
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Did you find Wilhite?
Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly. Something's going on.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's Perry.
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry. Jesus.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man. What else could it be?
Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.
Got it. Over.
Is that it? Is this right?
Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud. It ain't. I'm sorry...
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.
You better not say you missed that.
Y'all could be more specific.
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.
Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Hippy, you pussy.
Quiet! Quiet!
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
SHIT!
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Radiation is nominal. The warheads must still be intact.
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check. Right behind you.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
12000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Hey!
Getting a reading?
8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
How are you?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
A little more so this time.
But where are you going?
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
And how long will you be away?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
What is that one over there called?
That must be Basiluzzo.
At what?
Well?
Well, what?
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
Somebody must live here!
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Don't be so humble.
How should I be ... arrogant?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Find anything?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Yes.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes, you should go.
And what about you?
Claudia, listen to me...
Any news?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Aren't you going to change?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Why?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Good night, my love.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Have you ever been in love?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
To do what?
But where did you finally end up?
It's divine!
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
Please, you come too...
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
What happened?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
I'll stay here also.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
There too...
And what are we going to do now?
And who is this?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
What is it?
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Where is she going?
Giulia...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Why don't you try?
Don't you ever paint men?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
We have a radio like this, too.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Anything new develop?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
Thank you.
Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
What boat?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And how come you're up so early?
And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Zuria?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
You really must do me this one favor.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Agnes...
I'm a blimp.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Oh my dear child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Of God.
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
Why?
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
No.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I burnt them.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
For what?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
You have a lovely voice.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
No I'm not.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
First thing that comes to your mind?
God! But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
You've been alone together?
Yes.
Often?
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
One.
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
You liked Sister Paul?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not? Mmm?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
I'm not sick.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
And you're unhappy.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
Answer me! You never answer me.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
No...
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
She can't hurt you any more.
She can.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She...
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
Oh, yes.
And then...
I'm afraid.
Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Yes.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
I'm frightened.
Of what?
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
It grew.
What made it grow? Do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish... ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
And then what happened?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
My bed.
What else?
A wastepaper basket.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Which one?
I don't know which one
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
Why?
So I could go to him.
Who?
Him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Are you frightened?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I hate him.
It was dead.
It was alive wasn't it?
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
Agnes? Who? Mother Superior?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Why?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry...
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Something they... that they overlooked.
What? You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.
Thanks.
Martha, it's you.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
???
All I want is one more week.
Why? You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
No, no, no...
I can get you new evidence next week.
No!
Hello, Mama ... brought you something.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why do you think that?
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
That's absurd!
That possibility never occurred to you?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
It's my affair too.
???
Then help her.
I am...
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
All right, what do you need.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes.
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
What sheets?
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
About what?
Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Like keeping her home from school?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know...
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Stupid woman... and that's all?
That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one? Huh?
I'm out of prac... ... practice.
All right?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become? One is born a saint.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
May I be present?
Of course.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself I'm not going to allow this.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How ?
Don't be ridiculous.
But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I'm concerned about her health.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what? An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
And the baby.
No!
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
How fascinating. Do go on ... ... John.
Lay them down.
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They're yours.
They are?
Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
I bet you're -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
What about all these letters?
Shurrup!
Can you fix him for me?
Yeah.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
The police station.
Sure.
I'll murder that Lennon.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Spoil sport!
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ever seen one of these before?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Are you going in?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
You do - repeatedly.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Grotty?
But I won't.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Get him out of here!!
Have I said something amiss?
That's not your Grandfather.
It is, y'know.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
A butcher?
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Did you look in here?
Sure. .
What's up?
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, there you are!
Well ... come on.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Morning! Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Sorry.
Oh!
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
I'm not ...
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
Oh aye, a sledge.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And cunning.
Yes.
See you.
Books are good!
Parading's better!
Parading?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Me!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
And we're looking after him, are we?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Yeah ... so what?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Anything to spare?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
No, that's his other one.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
That little old man.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Like what?
Let's go and muck in.
Behave...
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Let's have you.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
You wouldn't!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew I could rely on you.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Aren't we ...
Where's my grandfather?
None for me, then?
That's mine.
Well ...
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Stop picking on him.
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, you want to watch it.
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
He's been gone a long time.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
Nerves.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Eh, what's all this?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Locked.
Engines off.
Good! Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
... I don't know...
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it. Oh boy.
Where the hell are we?
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Yeah. Two hours.
Gravity?
Is it solid?
It's... basalt. Rock.
Close enough to walk to!
I'm sending. Do you hear me?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
This is Chaz.
Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
You want to try?
Can we come up?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched. What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
What's wrong?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
What? <u>Why</u>?
Unknown! What do you mean?
Yes!
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
Yeah!
<u>He</u> died.
What?
Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
You like this shit?
It grows on you.
Where's it coming from?
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
What happened? Where's Sandy?
Dead.
Dead!
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Oh, no. Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It's really on there tight.
Hey, guess what?
What?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Meet us on the bridge. Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
Right.
Where did it come from?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
Boy, that's terrific.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Hey now, what is this?
There. Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it. The rest of you continue.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid? It's dead.
Now we're in for it.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
Sounds like a rough one.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
<u>How</u>?
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
It will be.
It must have stopped moving. I'm not getting anything.
The flamethrower!
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
No.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
I've got 'em! They're back on my screens!
How many?
Oh no.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
We can use the flamethrower.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
First contact...
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
That way.
What's wrong?
It's close, real close.
How far?
Air lock?
This looks ancient.
What'd he say?
But what can we do? He's out of radio contact.
There, it caught!
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
No, it's coming.
<u>What is it</u>?
Oh God, oh God no.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
Is it still dripping?
We're going home. We're in hyperspace.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
How?
We're the new pioneers, Chaz. We even have our own special diseases.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
Are they close?
They're on the next level up.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
We do know that.
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Where are we?
Let's hear it.
Oh my God.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence. Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Yeah, okay.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Good! Moisture content?
Zero. Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one. It's dead.
Anything else?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you. I've got you on my board.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Found what?
Martin?
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
But?
Find anything we missed?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?
Oh well... you know me.
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you! We're coming back!
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development --
Here, Chaz.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I understand why you did that.
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Take us up.
Engaged.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
We won't need it then.
Yes!
We've got it up here! It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Now what?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Which presumably means...
Let's hear it.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Kill me...
What did it do to you?
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
Headache? Dehydration?
Can I... um... have some water? Please?
What is it?
It's nothing, Doc. Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
Is it dead?
Yeah, it's fine.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Thanks.
We've got no option. We're gonna have to get it off.
Minh...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
What do you need?
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Seal everything now!
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ! We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Are you alright?
Where is she?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
I found it...
And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
I can't reach her. Too much signal break-up.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Fucking great. I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
How much air-time have I got?
Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Listen to what?
De Vries?
Yeah?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
What?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us?
I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
Forget it, man.
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay. Look...
What?
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Still got him?
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
What? Where?
Can't see a thing. Are you sure?
Wait. Lost it.
How?
Oh, man. That's no glitch!
It's alright, it's cool...
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Miss Noguchi! You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
Is this the suit?
Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
And...?
That's what we thought.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Fort Powell. What do we tell 'em?
Already working on it.
They've changed their heading again.
Compensate!
They knocked out the external feeds.
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
I'm serious. That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?
Four.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
What is that?
Seltzer?
'We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Yeah. Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C. They're the least of your problems right now.
Think I spoke too soon...
What?
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
You have to...
Jesus.
Yeah, exactly. Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
How's it going?
You should hit the sack, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Hello, there. Who are you?
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
May I come in?
You're more than modest.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie...
You take charge.
Hungry?
Just some coffee.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Just like that, eh?
Just like that.
I don't think that's funny.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
D-day.
Just like it.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
What time?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Why'd call me a killer?
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
We're?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
I never intended you to be.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Champion to champion.
What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
That's not true!
Then say so.
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
I won't play tonight. I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
No, it's not. It's for this.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Feeling better, my dear?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Margo.
Margo? Lunching in public?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
We have that in common.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
How nice.
Bill!
Huh?
You've already met.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Nothing?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well... ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Take care of yourself out there...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
Sing it?
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
What?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many interests.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Twenty minutes!
For instance what?
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
What's all over?
What fire and music?
Addison-!
Who?
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Don't mix your metaphors.
I mix what I like.
Okay. Mix.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
What a body, what a voice.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I've been aware of that for some time.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
Margo, let's make peace.
I wish it were.
Then what would be enough? If we were married?
Bill... ... where are you going? To find Eve?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Groom- - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
Groom.
Yes, dear.
You know what I'm going to be?
A cowboy.
A married lady.
Hello, what's your name?
Why?
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
So am I.
What have I got to do with it?
Everything.
Don't run away, Bill.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Lemme fix you a drink.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
How do you do, my dear.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Oh, brother.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people. Got your key?
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
Behind in your dues? How much?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Birdie-
Hmm?
You don't like Eve, do you?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- Voila.
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
You were just looking around...
That's all.
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
Probably not.
It was for my report.
I've heard of them.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I might.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Subway.
How long does it take?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
That's the door.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Oh, no...
She's got to meet you-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
If I only knew how...
Try...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Hollywood.
Mrs. Richards.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Of course.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Karen... ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
May I have your coat?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Don't get up. And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
There can't be very much-
Oh, but there is-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Eve... don't cry.
I'm not crying.
But the raves about your performance-
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I think I know...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Addison wants me to play it.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you. Yes. I've seen every performance.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
There are other plays...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
If you'd like.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Harrington.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
How much time have we?
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Do you want it on?
It doesn't matter.
Karen. I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Margo. Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
About what?
With tears?
Check.
I remember.
How was the concert?
Coming?
Margo, again...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
That's on time for Margo.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
Lloyd, be careful...
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve.
I'm beginning to catch up.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Now just a minute!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
I'm glad Bill's back.
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Would you, really? How sweet-
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Where is she?
Who's left out there?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
She's your understudy.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I have no intention of having an accident!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Hello..
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Miss Caswell? What?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
When's the audition?
A couple of weeks.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Would you?
Anything to help you out, Max.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
You get quick action, don't you?
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Promise.
I promise.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Are you breaking the contract?
Answer my question!
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I didn't hear you.
I said I'm a dying man!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Forget it, the main thing-- --did you call me a failure?
All right, what do we know?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hey?
--what do you think?--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
July of '71.
That was fun. What now?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
What's that?
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And?--And?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
I never scared anyone before.
Facts or theory?
Anything you've got.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
We understand your problem--
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
When?
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You want me to be the bastard.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
He'll give us a sworn statement.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I think that's him.
Who?
Nah. Maybe.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though.
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Jesus--
Woodward?
You overslept?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
--what time is it?
11:30.
Morning or night?
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
I'll never get out of here in time.
Sorry. Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Any idea what he did?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Well of course.
Donald Segretti?
You can't.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
I've got a lot of energy.
I know where Dwight works.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Tell that to Muskie.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe-- --off the record.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I didn't.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--so?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--you got more than one source?--
Speak.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Absolutely--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Five hundred; six maybe.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
I think.
Give me your checkbook then.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
There's always a later plane.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Hey, easy...
You've really got to go.
One minute but then--
...No... never in so many words...
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
Which people?
The ones who could disburse the money.
Who were they?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
So tell me about the Times article.
What do you want to know?
Something maybe big.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
To cover up?
But they both worked at the White House?
I will not talk about the other two.
I really can't talk now--
--I'm not your source on that--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
What's this?
How senior?
Just tell me his title.
I don't know titles.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. You're certain on Mitchell?
I got Clawsen on hold--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--what do you think?--
--I'm sure--
We can't talk inside either?
--I'm not here.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
Look, I told you inside--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
They are not my clients.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Where? What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
What?
Haldeman too?
Talk about Segretti--
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
There were more then.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
James McCord.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
I think so.
Are you sure?
It may never come out.
And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
I couldn't say.
But it's possible.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
...go on, go on...
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Colson, Harry?
--who you got?--
Anything?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Anyone but Bernstein.
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
More denunciations?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--no--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--which Young?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Haldeman. Right?
A boy or a girl?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
The what to what?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
Sorry.
No, it was good.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Christ! I didn't say you were out of the game!
Sorry, coach.
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris. There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Good morning gentleman.
Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party.
As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?
Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind. You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
All right, I got some scotch.
Single malt?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This is your plan, Finch?
This. Right now.
Of course, Finch. What?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now!
Easy, tiger. What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Not bad, Chris.
Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Of course, I didn't --
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on! I won't tell.
Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
What? No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
That's nice.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
I know. Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Hmm. You know that's really a shitty middle name!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
What?
I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
Do you?
Of course.
No comment.
Thanks. It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding? No.
Oooh, yeah. Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me! Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Fuck me! Yes!
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
There's our man.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA. Beer in hand by five after.
You can crash at Stifler's?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right. That gives us...
I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No -- it's true. He is...really... big.
Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.
You can send me the address too.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Please, God. Let this be it.
Holy shit.
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Back out? You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid. You afraid or something?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Okay.
I know, Dad.
Dad! I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Son. This lady's here for you.
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really? You seriously want to go with me?
Yes. Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
You guys got the Latin homework?
Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You can do that?
I still think you're okay.
There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
It's true. I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After getting laid?
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
You did it.
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Yes. No. Yes.
So you need to change, right?
James! You have come in here on purpose?!
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Strip?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Uh...
Move with the music.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Jim...
Did you see this? This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
No, not again.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Kevin, this is serious!
Tonight?
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot.
I think "shithead" really says it.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Kevin...you're not your dad. The two of us, we're not your parents.
I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Hey...
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Now?!
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah. Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay. Did you bring a condom?
I don't know. How do you?
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
Yeah Vick?
I want to hear you say it.
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What? Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind. You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Say that again, Kevin?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
Hey. I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
...Guess what?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit. From where?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
You actually said that?! Haaaah!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
Keep it down, dude.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God. You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Here, babe.
Really?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Merde! Just missed!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Just like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
God. How can you eat like that?
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Serafine...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I know. He told me.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
They're coming!
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What...?
We don't both have to die.
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Didn't even have to ask.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
What?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Well, they are French.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
You on drugs? Huh?
Pull over! Now!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Before the coma!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Claude...?
The ADM. Let's go.
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Nothing's happening!
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
Oh shit... No...
That's not all... Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
Not you too -
I don't believe we've been introduced.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Uncle Terrence?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Jesus...
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Enough. Cut him loose.
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Andy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What did she say?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Now!
Merde.
Well?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Saint Severin...
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission.
Ouch! That really hurt!
I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Now just get off the train.
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Every Russian family has one..
It's the best fork of all
What a beautiful ship!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Sad?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Oh! I'm sorry...
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
No! Well, yes, but
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
And this is my future. This is who I am!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
What was that?
It's her.
He's her?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
You're a princess...
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
But it's not the money, Vlad.
So where will you go?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
No. Empress, you --
You are the boy ...
Promise me she'll have her home.
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Rasputin! You're alive . . .
I had nothing to do with it!
You gave the orders!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Hey, you on television?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
What's your name?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Come on.
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
This guy's on television.
Can I have your autograph?
You don't want my autograph.
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Hey!
What?
Who's on television?
Singer!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yes.
It's okay.
Allison.
Yeah? Allison what?
We've been through this.
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right?
In the middle? We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Oh!
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Alvy, I...
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Get him!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right! Where?
Wisconsin.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Well, where is it? I-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
For yuh.

Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Huh?
You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, I know.
Your grammy!
Well...
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
You sure?
No, I got time.
Okay.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Sylvia Plath.
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, yeah.
Neat?
Duane?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
God bless.
Well, uh... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Me? Oh, uh. No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, so help me.
it's my first time.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
No, I'm gonna quit!
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah!
Yeah?
It's terrific.
Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Oh, all right.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay.
Okay?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
As Balzac said...
H'm?
"There goes another novel." Jesus, you were great.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No. You're a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Good? I was-
No.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah?
M'hm. You're not gonna believe this, but-
Hey?
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Look, look at that guy.
Look at these guys.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious. I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
You see, like you and I...
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
You- Do you love me?
Do I love you?
That's the key question.
Yeah.
I know you've only known me a short while.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah.
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Of course.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
You don't want me to live with you?
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
It relaxes me.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Really?
U-huh.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Let's just do it, all right?
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Were you always funny?
Are yuh?
Yeah.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
David? You call your teacher David?
I'm home!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
M'm.
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't. I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
Oh.
Are you okay? What's the matter? Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oooh.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Okay, let me have this.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
W-w-whatta you mean?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
I don't know.
Okay, okay. Okay.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Happy birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Here's a real present.
What... huh?
Remember, we had that thing.
What thing?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Oh, good. Okay.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Oh-
God.
Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
What?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
You mean that... I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
I'm late.
The what?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh!
Alvy.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
What'd I do?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Why are you so hostile?
Commentary.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
I can't.
What-
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Where are you going?
Man, that's great. That's just great.
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Key word here is "indulgent."
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Probably on their first date, right?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Oh, do yuh?
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Charlie Chaplin.
Hey.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Sixteen years ago.
Whatta you mean?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Stop calling me Max.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
How about a ginger ale?
You like this house, Max?
M'hm.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
The one with the V.P.L.
V.P.L.?
M'hm.
And... uh-
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Yeah. Right.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
His wife has diabetes!
You fired the cleaning woman?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
SO?
So the colored have enough trouble.
She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
All right-so we can afford it.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
I look pretty.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
M'mmm.
Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh. What about?
Hey-
Oh.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, gosh.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Yeah.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
A long time.
Oh yes.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Did you see permits? Did he have a license?
So who won?
A triumph. When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor.
Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
Jack. Did you compose that yourself?
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
It's going. It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
The camera loves her. A great actress.
No, what?
The movie.
Leo?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
October-ish.
I have a small window of time.
Leo. Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall. Thirty nine.
She already has.
I'm in mourning.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
What what's about?
Honey?
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
Oh.
To dander. Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
Really?
What is that thing?
You should have brought him.
Dander. He's allergic. Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going? I booked a flight.
He's not going tonight.
Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Anymore.
That for us?
What a nose. You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
Directing suits you.
Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Just did. Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Escape hatch.
So?
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
She left a note.
You need to call your dad.
Let me. I'm Jeffrey.
Monica.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
Oh. You're them.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time. Hey! Time. Judy! Time you guys. Hey!!
Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi?
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero?
You're crazy baby. I love you.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
I call that a perfect day.
A perfect night.
Damn near. And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm. We should do it again.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm. Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
Go.
Hey! Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair. You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey. Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Probably not.
We closed.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England. No small doing.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Not millions.
He's directing now.
There's still time to undo this.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
The Roses? And of course they said yes.
That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Yes.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
You're out of your mind.
Just do what I say, alright?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time, Jer.
What was it? What the fuck was it?
Ryan's novel.
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you. Most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
Accept a compliment.
What did you get me?
Kiss the back of my knees.
Through the sweats or not?
What?
No. Did you?
No. I missed that.
I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
Don't get it.
Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
I'm going to throw up.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do. We have to sign our taxes.
In the kitchen.
Yes.
Well, not yet. The gate was open?
Two minutes.
Still champions.
It's an unfair advantage.
You've got Cal. You've got Gina. You've got Skye? We're the leftovers.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner. Don't be angry.
Dolphins. Great.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away.
He'll find his way back.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Otis!!!!
Otis! Come! Good boy! Come!
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
And how hard it hit?
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
What are you saying?
Hello? Last birthday was?
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity. Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
You changed your mind.
What?! You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster. Exactly.
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I know.
I'll be with you.
I don't want to go tonight.
No.
Okay.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Me too.
That's under lock and key.
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
I know. It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
I know.
Will you make love with me?
Panes! How are you?
Oh, you know, I am.
What's a sign for that?
Coffee?
Sure.
We have a gift?
Thanks, I'll take that. Champagne?
I love gifts. What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Still. Well. Let's drop it.
No.
It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't I find what?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.
And I you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
The infamous dog?
Ours.
You lose this?
You got your DP?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy. Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Something soft.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Uh-huh.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh.
A little out of my element.
Hm.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
What?
But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
Oh shit. I'm sorry.
Easy tiger.
Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.
Would you sign it for me. I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I need to leave you now.
I will treasure this.
Are you okay?
I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.
What am I, five?
You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.
Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.
Ryan's really angry with me.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold.
That's very nice.
Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I'm so sorry.
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
What?
I didn't say a word.
I was faking it. I've been feeling caged for sometime. Funny, huh?
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
Yes.
I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
God willing.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Hi. Monica and Ryan?
Sally?
We could hardly say no.
Ryan!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.
Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I'm sorry.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I...
Is there space here?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Really??
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Yeah.
Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Very.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin. I want you to play.
It's a machine gun. I thought I'd kill myself.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal. It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
You don't know she's a bitch.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
How?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Fuck you, Panes.
You see, that's worse.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Everyday.
Shit!
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Shit. It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No. Really. For real. Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you?
Yes. Fine.
That's it? Yes. Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.
Alright. Well, that's something new.
No. Not something new.
Um. Happy for you.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Panes?
What did I do?
Yes.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Monica and Ryan.
I didn't know you had this.
Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.
Happy anniversary. Thank you for making me a part of it.
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
Enough about me.
Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming?
He's a novelist.
Ah.
Like Joe.
Hmm. Where are my kids?
In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.
I hope they're watercolors!
Nevermind.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
So how much do you hate her?
Well, I don't trust her. I never have.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.
Sophia! I'm not even pregnant!
Well good. Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Sorry I got you in trouble. But listen, you can share my rations.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Invisible!
Someone who follows his heart!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So, um...how was your day? What did you do?
Well... I declared war!
What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Really?
You're right!
Uh oh. Goodbye! Gotta run!
Wait! When can I see you again?
And you are...?
Yes.
No, General. I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
Divinely?
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Quiet -- sshhh!!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>! You were pretty hot to trot then!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
How should <u>I know</u>?
I order you to find out where we are!
Excuse me, I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Worker! Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>. It's <u>Z</u>.
Water...water...
We're going to die!
Want a list?
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee.
And only you can become a Queen?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
We've found it! <u>Insectopia</u>! Look at all this food'
You were right...you were right! Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Yes?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Why do they have you tied up here?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>. I want to try someplace different.
There isn't anyplace else -- Except the worker bar.
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
I felt the same way before I got married. Confused. Scared.
Who is that idiot?
Bala!
You new, kid?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do? Serve beverages? Process paperwork?
BARBATUS! You -- you saved my life!
Z! Over here!
Barbatus!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir. Your fiancee.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Scattered reports, sir. Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Get me Ant Team Six.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, no, sir!
Good. You're a good soldier.
So tell me. Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.
That's correct, sir!
Not that one. Or that one.
Royal victory party? Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one. <u>Me</u>!
Engaged? As in you're getting married?
Affirmative.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
May I cut in?
ARREST HIM!
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
No snacking between meals! Off you go! Now -- what were we saying?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
'Fraid not, your majesty. Goodbye, your majesty.
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Ask me why we're so successful.
Why are we so successful?
What do you see out there?
...Ants...
We declared war again? Are you scared?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Time to cut a rug, Z!
I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by accident!
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Wear this.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more! Now <u>dig</u>!
I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?
My mother.
This the place?
Not there. Under the mat.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh. Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Care to make a small wager?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
What did you do to your hair?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah. I better not get too close.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Would you like to?
You mean tonight?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
What time does the show go on?
Eight-thirty.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Marry Christmas.
Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
This is a bad day for me.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Why?
I think so.
What is it?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik -- -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Two o'clock.
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
You don't want me here --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Here. How about some breakfast?
No -- I don't want anything.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
When are you coming home?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I'm not very good at it.
I am. Let me get the cards.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean. Queen.
I don't want it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Was he really upset when you told him?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.
Who was that?
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
There's a call for you --
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
Sure. What's that funny smell?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Thank you.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Where?
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
The dishes?
I mean, after that?
What?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I don't?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Fine. How's your eye?
How's everything at the apartment?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh.
That's very wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
That's funny -- so am I. What did you do with the cards?
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Last night?
What for?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
Yes, sir.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
I don't know.
The Vice Squad?
What kind of joint are you running?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh.
I'm not through with you yet.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
I am?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Relax, Baxter.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen. Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Well -- I guess so.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Oh, yes. Thanks.
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.
So it was. She threw it at me.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Yeah --
You like? It's all yours.
I got kicked in the head, too.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Very clever.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
I dig.
Now you're being bright?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
No I didn't.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
You?
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so? You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You threatening me?
Good evening, Baxter.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Sometimes, there's a twi-night double-header. A nebbish like you!
My body? I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed. Good night, Doc.
She going to be all right, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sure, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
That so.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Who is Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Can I ask you a personal question?
No.
You got a girl-friend?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
Who?
Kubelik.
I see. What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
That guy really must've belted him.
Sleeping pills.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Do you know who this is? Look at him.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Come on, Fran.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Well -- thank you.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Let me take that.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
That's right.
You know I liked it better long.
How long has it been -- a month?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I want you back, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
That's enough, Fran.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Handle what?
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
I have that date -- remember?
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Okay. I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Stop that, Fran.
Coming?
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?
What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Some setup you got here. A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Where do you live?
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will. You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy! Come on, Sylvia.
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
See if they'll what?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Yeah --
Where are you headed?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I like all of them --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
My men --
You're out of your skull --
Esprit de corps --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
Get out --
Two whole drums --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Who the hell are you?
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
Part.
Which part is that ?
That's good gin.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Delta ?
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Tracks ?
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
Holy shit.
Arch light.
Chef.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
What do you see?
Probably is.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
How much is left?
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
What are we doing here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What'd he say?
Flood.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful, Captain, they've been known to charge.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Who knows what's up there?
Get in there !
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
What the hell is it?
They're not Cong.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
When'd you do it?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Signs?
Listen.
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
What cat ?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
They nail him for it bad ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
I only met Kurtz once.
Would he remember you ?
You didn't like him.
Our Recon flight ?
Ours.
Terminate ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Spooky.
Charlie?
What -- happened here.
Charlie?
Who is he?
How did they know?
Yeah.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
This gentleman or myself ?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
I thought he was a lame.
About what ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Well, he's killing now.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Captain?
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
You smell that. You smell that?
What?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Boss left.
How big it is?
Change.
Wh -- what?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
I got bored in Saigon.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
When did you hear?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
I met him.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Fucking savages.
Who?
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
I'm Kurtz.
Why did you come to ... my province.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you know me?
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
You've gone crazy.
You can't have water after morphine.
Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
Gimme water.
No water.
I think think a lie stinks.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Go away -- hide yourself.
What are you doing?
Going back - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
And you admired him?
Yes, I know...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Both of us...
Men looked up to him... He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
What?
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.
No -- no, Captain.
Which one's the Colonel's?
This one , Lance?
You think he'd of shot us?
When?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Sure.
What's this tiger shit?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
You think?
The other one --
What?
Captain Willard?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
This boat's a mess.
Why did they attack us?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
So Kurtz is alive.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Who are you?
His name is...
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
What's a big question?
Kurtz. I know you've heard of him.
Yes.
What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
What things?
Yes.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
I know.
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
What if I say no.
Right now -- I am.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
What show ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
That's 27, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --

You talk about ecology -- there it is.
117 CONTINUED:
134 CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Relax. I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
Avalanche season is coming.
48 CONTINUED:
Let's go.

113 CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!

212 CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
39 CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
Six months.
Had?
She's dead.
You should know something.
What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Why?
He's coming around fine.
What are you doing?
Stay here.
Thanks.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business.
Did you catch Corbett?
Was there any trouble?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Let's go.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
You're hurt.
Leave it here.
Let's keep going. We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Had no choice... ...Given the situation.
Okay by me. You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Ben Corbett?
Desmond.
New to the country, kid?
Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Does he have people?
Stay put!
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
That's right. You're not.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Be my guest.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Let's camp. There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Forget it. It would take days.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Yeah?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay awake! You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?
What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
I'm hungry. Go kill me some dinner.
An appetite. Maybe you won't die after all.
Don't push me..!
Don't bet on it.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Hullo, Sam. Slow day?
Ben...boys. Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Relax. One more day without drink won't kill you. Right, Sam?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I got it from here. Thanks.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation. I'll shoot you, Ben. Bank on it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
I need to rent a cabin.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- Here?! Where's Wilder?
If Corbett's men find out --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
What's wrong?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
What are you talking about?
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
Fuck you.
Bet you're right. But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there. Black and white smoke.
Damn. Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
I'm too old for this shit.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
LeMalle. We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
There you go. Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight. They shoulda got there yesterday.
Go easy.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
What you gonna do with it? Large bore's for shit on small game.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me? Ben?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There's what they're waiting on!
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Huh?
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
What is it you want? What?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi... Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
He's good... And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ... Dr. Bettes.
How long has he been having problems?
Since forever.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.
Me. My home number is on this card.
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
What about your mother?
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.
Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll get back to work today?
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
Getting loud, getting loud.
So. Anything else?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Nice of you... thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
I want you to go on this trip.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Is there another way to see it?
Hello?
Are you still coming?
Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Hi.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I was going to do that for you.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Thanks, Melvin.
Nonsense!
Hey -- you let him...
Stop asking everyone.
You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
Fries.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Never.
Sex with Simon?
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take a bus.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
Cute.
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
What job?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
What a break...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...
Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Yes. I really would.
Well...
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Can you not be violent?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you... Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
What are you trying to do to me?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
How's Verdell doing?
It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
She's nice.
What?
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Good evening.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
What?
Actually, I don't think so.
Shall I get her for you?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Terrify me?
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
How're you doing?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
Do you realize that I work at him?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
Thanks.
That's very thoughtful.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
Another place where?
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
You going to come talk to me or not?
Because... ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
What's wrong?
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Why are you doing this?
Is there a problem?
No. No problem. The airport, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
Where you from?
What is this?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Probably.
What are you doing?
What?
That was Peterson back there. That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You're right. Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What? You think I'm running you up?
What are you doing?
Get out. You think I'm running you up? Get out.
Sit back. Put your seatbelt on.
No fucking way.
What's your name? We both know it's not Nicholai.
Bain. Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
It's just a shoot-out then. Sixty- forty, at best. Not my odds.
Robert Bain, driving me! Jesus fucking Christ!
So what happens now?
We go around once.
Okay.
How'd you know? Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Five million dollars?
That's right.
Did you see how I did that? Magic wasn't it?
What?
You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Good afternoon. We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no. I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Sick. The flu.
Send the file. I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
Who?
How did he know?
Know what?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Deadline?
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
Is this how it went, Nick?
You think this is a fucking joke?
A player?
What?
He has to clean up. How many bodies were there?
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Nikita? She helped me find you.
What? How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess. Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Who the fuck are you? Who do you work for?
I work for the government.
Bullshit.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you? A fucking pro.
Twenty large? That's all?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Ten million --
Now what?
Okay. How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Nikita?
You're one of them, aren't you?
'Them'?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
The nature of the business. You remove your competition.
And you want to use me to get him?
Yes.
Forget it!
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath. Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
What do you want to know?
No.
Why?
With computers.
It's not the same, is it?
He was... taken.
I killed him.
How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that. I never thought so.
Why not?
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course. I was going to be James Bond.
The exotic women.
Women? No... not really.
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why?
Because you are a women.
They tried to kill you?
Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Are they usually like that?
No. Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It. Tell it. For all I know it could be a machine.
You said you didn't trust it.
Do you have a passport?
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Hey, where are you?
Thinking.
About?
I don't know.
That's where he'll be.
What?
No.
Why not?
It helps me to focus. It centers me, helps me think.
Oh. What do you think about?
Do you think about the game?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
No.
Not even a stalemate?
No.
Do you think he's here?
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
Breakfast.
Okay.
You should knock.
Sorry.
How was the beach?
Where did you learn it?
Taiwan.
Thank you.
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
It's too late now. Okay? We'll have to deal with these.
Okay. Then what?
Then, we wait.
That means you won't have a gun.
We split the money?
Five million apiece. You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I told you, he will.
You can't know for sure, how can you? I mean, you're not him.
For Nicholai?
Yes.
Ten years ago.
Yes.
What did he say?
He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game.
Was that it?
You didn't take it.
No. I went back to the hotel. And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Do you have ulcers?
No.
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
I hate bishops. They're useless. I like knights.
They're worth less points.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.
Jesus, if someone had --
Nobody ever sees me.
No.
No?
It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.
I know. It makes me crazy.
And you were drilling these holes...?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What are you doing?
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
Why? I don't know.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you. A pro.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Did you --
No. I tried to stop it. I couldn't.
Is this becoming complicated?
Were you attracted to me right away?
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Four minutes.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra! Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
Jesus! Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
Hi. Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
You're very good at this aren't you?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Everyone regrets something.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Sometimes.
Do you ever think about starting over?
All the time.
Then, I'll sail alone.
Do you believe that?
Is that all you want?
Thank you.
How much farther?
I think I've heard of you.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
A dime.
One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
You wish to close this account today?
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
A coke, if they have it?
Cheers Katka!
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
You guys having a go a me or what?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Anything in it?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Oh yeah, what's that?
An alternative literary venue!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
That stinks!
He was an electrician?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
And put it on expenses?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
No, why?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Need any disks?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.
Close!
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Perfect!
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
Let's split.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
Am I late?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
No beer?
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
My God! What happened?
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Holly!
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Damn!
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
What happened?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
And if you're wrong.
Siberia.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
God, I think I need a holiday.
Some deal you did there!
What about me?
Yeah, no problem.
I made a deal with Josh.
What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
No!
You're sure?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Do you know the way?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
Take this exit.
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
It's that one isn't it.
There shooting at something.
Doug?
Good morning.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
So am I.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Yes.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
That's my mum's.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Sure. Excellent.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
We should be done by the weekend.
Really?
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You used to read.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
What?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
What? You are crazy!
I don't want to get in trouble.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
She's tired.
No way Doug, I can't.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
No.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Will it help to get you out?
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Can we charge admission?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yep, it's all yours.
They'll do it.
Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
And take Jiri with you?
What for?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Am I invited?
I thought I'd help out.
We don't need you.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Better than you.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Where did you steal the car?
It's Josh's.
This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.
Enjoying our hospitality?
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Really!
I'm not sure it's possible.
I'll need to make a phone call.
Would you like your things now?
Yeah!
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
Yeah.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Sure!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
No problem, is it at your place?
But I have to finish this....
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
Just yesterday.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Later.
I think we should be going honey.
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
That's my bag.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
You bastard!
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are responsible...What has happened?
What are you an idiot!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
So, who is in the building?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
With you.
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
I'm sorry about how we --
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
And I have no idea why.
What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
That's over. Way over.
You saw him?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Thanks.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Late night. You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
Landon --
What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm thinking.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
You do --
The address?!
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Who are you?
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
Were?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- This play means a lot to me.
This play -- ?
That's deep --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
Why?
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Like me.
What the -- ?!
What's with the friggin numbers?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
I'm an enemy?
You got some kind of list?
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
I'll take a chance.
Go for it.
So what else is on this list?
It's private.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
I know. Don't say anything.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You think so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
The world of the dead?
What is that?
Saturn. Beautiful.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
You're really into God, right?
In ten words or less?
Yeah.
My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
You have to believe to have faith.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
She great or what?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.
What?
Yes. But not as a date date.
Why not?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
Your turn.
No.
Before we do this.
Excuse me?
Stand right here.
You're acting like a crazy person.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
You're sometimes not sure?
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
I don't understand...
I might do it wrong.
You make me feel...
Loved?
Assholes. This happen to you?
What's wr--?
Come on.
Where?
What would you do up here?
What'd you tell your father?
When did you build this?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
So what do you want to see?
Mars.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
Ergo?
What about your father?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
From citizen high to citizen low.
I don't care.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Jamie --
I'm sick.
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I should have told you sooner --
Are you frightened?
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Anything you want.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
Lower. Same page.
How're you doing?
It's gone now.
I'll talk to your father.
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
Up to?
Did you give him a gift?
No.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm asking how much.
Dad --
No. I want what's best for you.
No you didn't. But he did change. Just not enough.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
This week.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
No.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Your parents are divorced?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Materially or spiritually?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Praying.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
I'm not tired.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
You're marrying again.
Yes.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
I'm no dummy.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
Shall I give you a few ideas?
I'd work backstage or something?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
When do I get time for me?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Thank you.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
So what did we just make?
A similar triangle?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Scalene?
What do you want, Biff?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
This... is the number one single?
Yes, sir!
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Morning Dick.
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Hot tip, Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
How old are you?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
You remember me...?
What time does school start around here?
Nine o' clock. Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
Hi, Marty!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
How are you?
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
No, Chinese food is fine.
The sunrise? What for?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Well... yeah...
What do I say?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
Huh?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
'Bike fine point?'
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why?
Why what?
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Not a holocaust --
You have a name?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Catch you later!
But Professor --
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Exactly two minutes difference... and it's still ticking!
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Marty.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
A mall?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
I know.
Where did you get this?
My guess is that she turned him down.
There's no way of knowing.
You didn't?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What do you call this?
What theater was I at?
Pretty, isn't it?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What?
Sweet and what? Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place!
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Suzy!
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What's going on?
Okay.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
You ever held another job before?
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Oh yeah?
We did it, Ray.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Thirty aught six.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Well, Kit...
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
What'd you come out here for?
Is that right?
Hi.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
What for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Holly.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
It's okay.
You still in school?
Nah, I got me a job.
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
What?
Can I be honest?
Sure.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Nothing.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Spanish.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.
You're a redhead.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
What a nice place.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
My stomach's growling.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Somebody else is going to get it.
I don't care.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Yeah.
Is that all there is to it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
But it would hurt.
Don't call me stupid.
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
Are you sure?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Why?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Look at all this junk.
How's he doing?
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Think I got 'em?
I don't know.
What'd you put him in there for?
You tired?
I don't want a steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.
Positive?
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Have you got a better idea?
I just don't want to go.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Really?
What's that?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.
Yes?
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Fine.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Maybe.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.
It's mine all right.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Wanta sue me?
So we'll help. Let's get crackin'!
New Jersey?
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Buckaroo! What the Sam Hill!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Antidote to what? Whose disguises?
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
You okay?
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
Arachtoid.
We will, old fried, we will.
Anybody we know?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really. This is pretty important.
Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Dead. Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.
What is this thing? A fighter?
We're going down! Onto the runway!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we did it! Pull up!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny! Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo. Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away. Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You. Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
Who?
The girl I remind you of.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
You keep an eye on it.
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
How did she die? I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go. We're on borrowed time.
What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
It's too dangerous.
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here! No Overthruster!
John Whorfin will kill us!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
No, sir. I think the flint...
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
What's his problem?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women. Can you play that thing?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pick those up, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Pictures don't lie.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.
The name's Reno. This here's Perfect Tommy.
Why me?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
We're waiting for the Jet Car. Billy's bringing it.
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery. He'll be waltzing along momentarily. What're you doing tonight?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I see.
...I know this must look... funny.
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
...Who is this?
If you could, I'd 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
How d'ya like your room!
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Who?
...Hello.
I write.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
What DID you mean?
How long you been up there, Fink?
Ever talk to him?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Ever act?
...Huh? No, I'm 
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
I'm a writer. Ted O 
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?! You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
A souse!
To do what?
What do you do far a living?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Go ahead, son.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
...That's fine.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Sound a little what?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Can be. Not easy, but 
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
Nope.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...This must be boring you.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...Yeah, okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
...Your room does that too?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well...
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
Barton. Are you all right?
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this? What're we gonna do?
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
Hold on 
You gotta believe me 
Hold on 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
We gotta call the police 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
Jesus... They can tell that...
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
You'll be back?
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor. It's just me  Charlie.
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Where did we put him?
...Yes, thank you.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I 
I apologize, Barton.
Fink.
Mr. Lipnik.
Yes sir, they 
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Excuse me?
Transient or resident?
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
What 
...Those your only bags?
L.A.P.D.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Is this multiple choice?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Big fuckin' deal.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
He teach you to do it?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr. Lipnik.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Where were you tonight?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
When did you start drinking again?
There's no smoking in this building.
Take care, you hear?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
So -- how are things?
How about the booze?
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
No.
Yes.
You okay?
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Baby-sitting. Rookie cop.
What was she like?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
You did it for me.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something. From a clinical point of view.
What was she like in school?
Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About --
I don't need any help.
What is this interest you've got in her?
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up! Don't move.
Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth?
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Are you arresting me?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
You like playing games, don't you?
How did you feel when he died?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
I'm tired.
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Am I... disturbing you?
Would you like a drink? I was just going to have one.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You tell me.
It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
There's a name from the past.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I didn't.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
Do you?
You're not easy to figure. I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be.
Fine.
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
When did you write it?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.
I'll risk it.
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
Fine. How's your back?
Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You shouldn't play this game.
You're in over your head.
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
It's OK. It's OK.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
No?
You won't believe me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
When?
About three months before I met you.
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
What did he say?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I just thought I'd surprise you. What's the matter?
I found Lisa Henderson.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No.
How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?
No.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
I'm very good at research. I'll help you.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really. What are you writing about.
A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.
What happens to them?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
I finished my book.
How did it end?
What do you want, Nick? Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
I hate rugrats.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
How did he die?
He was murdered.
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.
It teaches you to lie.
The answer is no. I didn't kill him.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
What kind of drugs?
In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.
What was the weapon?
.38 revolver. Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
Nope. There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did. Like I say. It never panned.
Thanks.
I hope I helped you out.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
Ain't that cute? They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
How'd it go, son?
She misses me.
Was she ever suspect?
What's goin' down, son?
I got tired of being played with.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
She want to play? Fine. I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I went over last night, too.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You don't like punk rockers?
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
Catherine says you don't like her.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Where the hell you goin'?
I'm going with you.
Maybe the maid did it.
He ain't that way. He's got heart.
You look like dogshit.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Homicide.
What do you want?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Were you with him last night?
Are you kidding me?
So what do we do -- nothing?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
You sure?
Now what?
What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.
How did they die? Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, Phil.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
She killed him.
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
Tell me again. I want to hear you say it again.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
Anderson. Jack W. Donald M. I'm sorry. No Lisa.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Can there be some mistake?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Is this finished yet?
I don't know.
When's your show?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
Let's get out of here.
Do you ever get sick of it?
Of what?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Ouch..
What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
What's with the wigs?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
No.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Who did this? Who did this?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I didn't see you.
What do you mean?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I'm here.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.
What are they?
Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks good like that.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Yes, but as a black painter 
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
What?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
Who said that?
Should there be?
Would you like to see the wine list?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Really?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
Out?
It's Andy again.
Still not here.
 In this corner?
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Blue? Where?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Who am I?
SAMO.
You're shattering all my myths.
About what?
Your people.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
I don't really have any problems.
She's good.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Drugs??!
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
You do! You definitely do.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Do you know what he's saying?
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie. This is smack.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
I hadn't thought about it.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
It looks done.
... babies.
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
Hi.
What's that?
How is he?
What's that about?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
I really... admire you.
Me? Why?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
That's great.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
Come on.
Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
You're a fast mover.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
That one's for you.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
Hey, Rene.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
'Phillips head,' right?
You don't have any!!!
OK! Goodbye!
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
It's cold.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
I will relay the message.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh? Funny, but sort of mysterious...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Ah. "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
I guess this mean we won.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
How could you? I'm a woman...
Hanging on every word.
Hey stud: I thought we had something together.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
First you're gonna shut up. Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
We've met.
Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
No. And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
Pouring myself into my work.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Selina. Hi. Didn't mean to --
You almost sound enthusiastic.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
"We"? You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
"Vicki." Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Photojournalist.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding. What say we ...
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here. So why'd you come tonight?
... What do we do?
Hmm. Primitive ventilation.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
No. No glass on the inside.
It does to me.
Your blood, Max.
My blood? I ... I gave at the office.
Let's make a deal. <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
I'll warm ya! I got hot mitts --!
Batman. The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Are you perchance a registered voter? I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Y'mean frame him?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Me, domesticated? By you? I doubt it! You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Son!
She jumped. She'd been depressed.
Yes. <u>Yes</u>. Boyfriend trouble ..?
Ten, nine...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Yawn. That coulda come from anywhere.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
We need signatures. To overturn the ballot. I can supply those, Oswald.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my mother's dismay -
You certainly will not.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I'm sorry. I was too late.
Uncle Alfred?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
He's over-eager, impulsive. I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I must have dozed off. My sincerest apologies, sir.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir. So much goes on-
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze. Batman monopolized the evening news.
Is there something wrong, sir?
But I can't can I?
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
It's good to see you.
What seems to be the problem?
Women.
Advanced botany. DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage...
What is it?
I'm on break from-
Oxbridge Academy?
Their new computer sciences division. How did you know?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did.
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know. I didn't need your help.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Alpha. Got it. What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Youwsa! Nothing but air.
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
Pow! What! Kazow!
What exactly are you doing?
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Damn? Damn is not good.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Go on, kill me too. Just as you killed my wife.
Nice suit. And today you are?
Nightwing. Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit. The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course. He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million. Three million - -
Pull back. You can't make the jump.
I know. The feeling just vanished.
I can't believe we were fighting over a bad guy.
Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
I'm totally over her. Positively.
Me too. Great stems, though.
Umm-hmmmm.
How did you...?
Can he save her?
No beauty...
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
What are you talking about?
We gotta get those locks changed.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Winded, old timer?
They're overly protective. You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Dr. Pamela Isley.
We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies. Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
No!?
Umm. What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
And?
You're not even listening to me.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Who's Ivy?
What?
You just called me Ivy. Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.
That's gotta hurt.
What happened to his wife?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I got the diamond. Quell problemo, Bruce?
Of course. Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
He's dying. And I can't deal with it.
I checked the medical database. No one else is even close.
I'm late for the dedication. Then I go after Freeze and Ivy. Alone.
Like hell you do.
And she did it all for me. For love.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce? I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
An enticing offer. But what does the lady want in return?
I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
No gun. How disarming.
My reserves are exhausted. I must have the gems that power my suit.
Make yourself right at home.
Where is my wife?
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
What say we turn up the heat?
You're skating on thin ice. My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme. These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Give it up. If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
I've got to stop him.
Bad luck, I'm afraid. It's time to die, little bird.
What do you mean?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.
You're too late. Say bye-bye birdie.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Dr. Isley? Pamela? You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
It'll never work.
Scholarly research?
She has an excellent mind.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
What did you say?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Perhaps the fall...
There's one other thing. I feel..
What?
...A bat.
What?
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Letters in the alphabet.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
How ya doin', Al?
Al?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Up here, Al.
Just checking, young sir.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Now black rubber.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Mr...?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Wait. You can't go.
We'll talk some other -
So glad you could come.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Just ones this beautiful.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
That's usually my line.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
He sure did.
What?
Find anything interesting?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Why do you do that?
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Touchy, touchy.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't want to remember!
I don't-.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
...Not the bat?
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm outta here.
I need to be part of this.
You can't-.
Bruce, you can't.
Edward...
Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
I'll show you it works.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
_We_ sure are.
...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
I got family. ...Please.
...or death.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Holy shit.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
About what?
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
A-14.
B-12.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Yes?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
... Murderer...
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
I know. I called them.
What about the girl?
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Please.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
How'd you find this place?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
What is that?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Is this what you wanted?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it.
Great. Give me a grant.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
As far as I know.
Do you sail?
That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
No.
Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere. If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
But it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Maybe we should just kiss.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Finding out where she is.
Got it!
What now?
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it. If there's a problem --
I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you.
What are you talking about?
Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.
What are you, scared of heights?
Gimme a break, will you? Shut up.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
My brother's a priest, man.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I understand.
It's me. "Sugar Bumps."
Jack? Thank God. I can't believe it's you. I heard you'd been --
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I've considered that possibility.
That's it?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
... Thank you.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
No.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You actually know all these people?
Where does one man get all this junk?
All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Rich. Reclusive. Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Likes to kill? KNOX Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
Peanuts?
Nice snap, huh? Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Oh, Bruce...
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeah. Deja vu.
HOLY SHIT!!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Scottish.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Go ahead.
There were three strawberries.
Liar.
Ali? What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin. Honey, you-re not making sense ...
David, I'm serious!
Hi,
Hi..... Roses.
Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Let's get a coffee.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Here, let me do that.
Two dollars please.
Annie, it's me.
Oh, right, yeah. two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Right first time.
Excuse me. Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go. Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
Oh yes.
Howls he getting on with the family?
And howls Alison?
Yes, isn't he.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Say that again, son.
Tomorrow. You have a problem with that?
Ah, David. Finally. And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
No!
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David?
David, David, David ...
Of course.
And a car.
Maybe two cars.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Welsh.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Bye, Dad.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Sure did.
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Well, there is that ...
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
But is she gonna be okay?
Doctor Jacobson?
Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn. I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Interesting suit.
Why thank you sir.
off the peg?
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Nope.
Of course he is.
Come on Sting!
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
What's gone?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.

No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.

Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?

No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
My butt's bothering me!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
That's not that much.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.

I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.

Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.

You already said that, Butt-Head.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Really? I poop too much.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Uh... No, I poop too much. Then I get tired.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
...Two...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.
Cavity search...?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Not on him, Chief.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
You got two seconds!
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
No, Jane.
You'll be rich!
Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
You're doing it, Adam. You're saving this town.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
How's your arm?
You'd better sit down, hon.
I am sitting.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Two hours.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
De<u>ceased</u>. I don't know where it came from.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Maybe this is heaven.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
What's she doing here?
Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell. I hate these people.
They make gypsies look good.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey! Don't go out there. You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That's it? No number, or instructions?
That little girl saw us.
She couldn't have. We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.
Are you crazy? She can't hear you.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
My God, we're back where we started.
Look at this, everything is different down here. All our furniture is gone.
That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Of course I did.
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
What happened?
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Honey. Let's go.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
And your sushi was remarkable.
The sushi? I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now. That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
He might have hurt somebody.
<u>Adam</u>! Why did you build a whorehouse? Have you ever been to...?
You know, I've been thinking. I could teach Lydia to sew.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What...?
What time is it?
3:30 I guess.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
You can actually see us? Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>You</u> did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
So can I?
Uh-uh. Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months? What difference does that make?
Good luck. You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. So what's my cut?
Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>! Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Yes... or no? Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
All right. Who are you?
We're...
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We're very unhappy.
-- Like you used to be?
If... we have trouble. What about the guy in the flyer? Betelge...
No, you don't! He does not work well with others.
You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
Tell the truth.
I hate you! I can't trust anybody!
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
You could double the size of your hardware store! You'll be rich.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped. Split. Vanished.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground. Who cares?
I want to get in.
You do? Over here? On <u>my</u> side?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
That's right. They treat you like scum I bet?
Yes.
Three syllables.
No, dummy. Two.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle? Beetle? Beetle fruit? Fruit bat? Fruit battle? Volkswagen? Fruit wagon?
I am <u>not</u>! Beetle... Juice?
That's it!
God, you're anatomically correct!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You were the snake! Right? I know. I saw you.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
They'd look silly on me. I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
Your qu...? But you're...
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax. We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Where is your mother?
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Dad. Do you believe me?
Yes. Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
... sheets.
The attic room is locked --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts. They're not here!
I don't care from guilt. I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Are they suffering?
Any particular kind?
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
What's wrong?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
What do you think?
Viridian?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Attic space.
You don't have a key?
Maybe Charles does.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
<u>No</u>! Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Hellooo! How's school?
It's bad luck. And I believe hugely in luck.
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
Their wedding clothes.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
... Straight out?
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Were you going somewhere?
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
In a day or two, yes.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... But he's...?
... He walked off...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, sir.
A Black man gave me the message.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Thank you.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Oh, yes.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
... Why... No, I don't think so...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Fine. He's very nice.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Chauncey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Yes.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I like to watch.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Hello, Sid.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I don't want Robert.
I see.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I agree.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
I agree.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
I want to tell Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Sir?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
Some pictures...?
Yes. Of men and women.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
This is terrible, sir - I hope you're not badly injured...
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
I agree.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Please, sir.
... Yes. You can take me.
... My suitcase.
How long do we stay in here?
... That is a very small room.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
I see.
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Well, ain't that the truth...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'... ... gotta go now, Chance...
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today...
I live here.
You live here? ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Since you were a child?
No.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Good morning, Mr. President.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes, I will.
Yes. It has.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Nothing.
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Yes, ma'am.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
And look who you brought with!
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I can certainly understand that...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
Good night.
Look, Johanna...
Yes? What have you found?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
This is not what I requested.
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Thank you, Colonel.
Ben!
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Yes, I did.
It's that serious, huh?
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Okay.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Yeah.
Malkovich.
Thank you.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
I never played a jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Morning.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
Is the trial date set?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
Yeah, just an idea I had.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I want to try.
Now?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
How was it?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Why?
What are you doing?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
No they're not.
You've always hated the animals.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What's that?
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Yes.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
We?
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!
Tell her you need to see her.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
What's that?
You fell in love with her first.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
My God!
He's a lucky man. Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You came up here looking for the portal?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Schwartz.
Pardon?
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Yex?
I am a trained performer.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Security.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Who told you?
I'm right?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
What'll you have?
The usual, Barry.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
That's the usual?
You're a fag or a liar.
Hi.
Yikes.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
This is important!
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Lotte? Is that you?
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
Hello. Wendy.
No.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Impressions? Those are hard.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
The Great Mantini?
But I think I have another plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Yes, my dear?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you dream often?
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Anybody else?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Yes?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
We have to meet.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Did you see the reviews?
She's not available.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
Is there dancing?
No.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Do you mind?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Darling!
Come on in.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Well?
Well what?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
No. Sorry.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Beloved..She's mine I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You don't sit with me!!
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Don't pay to complain.
Your mother all right?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Yes?
May I come in?
What you want?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Oh.
What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Back stiff?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Could be that fall you took.
Should I wake her?
No, let her rest.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
MAMA!
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
She likes this dress...
No...no...no..
Out where?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
I know Denver.
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
It's her, ain't it?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
He knew Baby Suggs?
That's so.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
I don't want to know.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Jesus.
It ain't what you think.
Leave off..
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
You shaved.
Yeah. Look bad?
She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver.
You got to get up from here, girl.
What, baby?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah?
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Fuck.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski. Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Hey, man, I'm not--
Who're you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man! That's terrible!
Yeah, it sucks.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Come and get it.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it. Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU! I FUCK YOU!
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yeah.
What's this?
That is for the urn.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They range up to three thousand.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuckin' A.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
What's a pederast, Walter?
If what's during league play?
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday. Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
It's already posted.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Kill that poor woman.
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
What have you. We'll, uh--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
I've had a--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please! Please!
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Lebowski on the right?
Nancy's pretty good.
Wonderful woman. We were very--
Are these.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Different mothers, huh?
No, they--
Jeez. Think he's got room for one more?
Heh-heh--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Color?
Green. Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
In the briefcase?
Papers. Just papers. You know, my papers. Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
...Me, I don't drink coffee. But it's nice when they offer.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No. Here.
Uh-huh. That some kind of Eastern thing?
Far from it.
I like your style, Dude.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
Oh, hey man, how are ya? I wondered if I'd see you again.
Wouldn't miss the semis. How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Sure. Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled.
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks. How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No! No! NO! THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man! Come on, man!
Relax, man! No physical harm intended!
Who the fuck are you? Why've you been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
Hello, gentlemen. You are the bereaved?
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet you.
"Johnson"?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here.
A hundred.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
And please don't call her my mother.
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeez. I miss vinyl.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well yeah...I know that.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Delayed after-eff--
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Oh?
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
What do you do for fun?
What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
Huh? He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
So...that doctor.
This was, uh--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
What's your point, Walter?
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Donny! Please!
Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?
State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Hey man--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Hey Walter--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Anyway. How much they offer you?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
...They gave Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll.
Have it your way. The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
The what?
What the hell is this?
My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit. Walter.
Shutup, Walter! Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
FUCK.
Huh?
Wooden bridge, huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Walter!
Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
That's it. I'm out of here.
You don't know, Walter? You seem to know the answer to everything else!
It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That wasn't her toe.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry ma'am.
Thanks Walter.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
They're nihilists.
Huh?
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah.
All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Uh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . . Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?
Is the car out front yours?
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
And the fucking money!
Dude?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
It is a fucking emergency.
I understand. That's why I picked up the phone.
Yeah?
Shit yeah!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, and you were--
You know this!
This driveway.
It's all over, man! We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah.
Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
Hy God! They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter Sobchak.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Walter--
Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Shit!
Dude here.
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?
Shut the fuck up. Hello?
Yeah?
Dude here.
Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.
Yeah.
So no funny stuff. Okay?
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.
Huh? No, she, she hit me right here.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Are you employed, sir?
Is this a--what day is this?
Dude.
Huh?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
Fuckin' A.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well, she's back. No thanks to you.
Well? Aren't you?
Well. . . yeah.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
You monsters!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Oh, shit.
Smokey Huh?
Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but--
Am I wrong!?
I'm not--
Walter--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Why?
Two years.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Where to first?
What was that?
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
how long since he was bitten?
He's right about one thing. We do have to survive.
Blade. We've got six Reapers. They're all dead.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
You don't want to go there.
Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Why do you hate us so much?
You're hurting me.
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
What do you want me to do?
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
He's right. They'll smell that you're human. Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
What's your problem, Whistler?
Come on, Blade. Talk to me!
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So?
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak -- Where did you get it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors. Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
He was here. Watching us.
Nomak?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Hey, hey! The fuck you doing?!
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Are you insane? He'll kill us both!
Yes?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose. Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope. Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
What about you? You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Whistler!
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
Get in. Youre leaving.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
Don't try to talk --
Whistler, I --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
Hold out your hands.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Who is LaMagra?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
But he's a policeman --
And that's a good thing?
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
There is no cure.
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
How can you tell?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like what?
What is this place?
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is he sick?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
Please --
How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
I don't believe that.
This isn't human blood.
Then what is it?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
How do you like that? Right on time.
You.
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Why do you hunt them?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
What happened to the power?
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Bullshit! Talk!
Domini?
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--Christ almighty--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
'Thought those all got stolen.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Why are we here?
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
What's she look like?
--how old?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
Yeah, so?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Druid Hill Park.
Looks like business is booming.
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
Jesus.
What?
No.
You sure?
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
You don't want it though.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
What?
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
I don't know. Nightmare.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--or someone--
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I want to see the tapes.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
--you should get back into bed.
Was that you laughing?
What?
Just now?
No.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I can't.
I want to see something!
Whatever you want.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Are you marked like this??
Why?
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
I know, I know.
Absolutely.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
I can't.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
What? That made her lose the baby?
This is a little nuts.
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Okay, a blur.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Can't you like just divine it?
--go!
The witch?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Nice tent.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What movies?
What I never could figure about the movie?
Yeah?
No fucking.
No sense at all. I'm a little stressed.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
What about night?
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Boy Kurth.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
That's a "j."
For "James?"
Who?
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--who?
Hold this.
What?
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--turn the camera off--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Graduate Thesis--
--Cotter--
--a Wiccan--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
I'm not finished.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
What?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
How're the cameras doing?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
403 41st Street, kids: home.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Enough to keep sane.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just hold on!
Just let it go, I've got you!
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
What?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
She got <u>paid</u>.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
What?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work! Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
What's that?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
For a blur?
Cotter'll kill you.
He'll never know.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
That's why she kills children.
You gonna be alright?
Sure. I'm sorry.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Get some more beer.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
What?
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Anna--
"It's why the witch kills children."
I thought all witches were benign and good.
What the fuck's going on here?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
....Ma'am?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
No, I--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Meurice--
...Ray?
Yeah.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
See a guy.
Who was it?
What?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Huh?
...Well I'll be damned.
Yeah? What happened?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Uh-huh.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Remy.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Thanks.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What?
What night is it?
...Friday?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...You know that car?
No.
What's the matter?
...What was that back there?
Back where?
Sign.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What "what"?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Then what'd you come here for?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
Now that don't make much sense.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Got a job for you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
You want me to kill 'em.
I didn't say that. Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
For the money.
...There's a big--
I want you to go fishing.
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
...What did you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
How would I know?
What's this?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
What.
This.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Howdy stranger.
Is Marty here?
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

Okay.

Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?

Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.

How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No. Come on.

Does that scare you?
Shut up.

Oh yeah?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Where are they?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Are you alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So. what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Why not?
Yeah. but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
O.K.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Okay. yeah, call.
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay. thanks.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
Okay. be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
... You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.

Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
God. you scared me.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
No.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
No. you're right.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.
Greetings, Mr. George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Are you sure you're okay? You're pale.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Surprise.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.
Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
What? You're not going to wait for me?
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What? Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths? Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.
The coca is my responsibility!
Why are you speaking?
I see. How much?
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't know...
Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What did I tell you?
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George. Just business.
Happy Birthday, George. Mirtha invited me.
I heard.
You?
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
What?
Your offense? Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
Murder.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing. Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind. Not for you to worry.
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.
What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.
Diego Delgado, please?
Allo?
Diego? It's George.
George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.
I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.
But you must. It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.
Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Touche.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
Just a friend.
Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Three million. I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Nothing. Todo esta bien.
Take it easy! Everything's okay!
Derek Foreal.
George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
I did not.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?
Coke.
Cocaine? How much?
I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long? A week?
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off. You're tan.
Barbara.
Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
G-d, son.
It's a family heirloom.
I've seen those in magazines. They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Layaway shmayaway.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
It would be my pleasure.
The man in the garden. He was full of courage.
Yes, it is.
Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
I want money.
Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
Money.
And Diego?
George, you look terrible.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I'm sorry, George.
That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
What are you going to do?
That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
Not mad.
You're like your mother. You love money.
Hi.
She's angry. It's all over the news.
Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You're not going to trial?
No.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots.
That was a beautiful message.
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck? Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
George.
Figured it out.
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Hello.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know. My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you.
Look, Mirtha. She's walking.
She did that before.
No. These are her first steps. Watch her.
Yeah. I know. She did that before.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
Can you lift the furnace. I need money.
Where are you going?
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.
What do you want?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going.
Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
Hey, George. You okay?
Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
Well, here I am. See?
Dad.
What?
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
Where are you going?
I don't know. Maybe California.
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
I don't believe you.
I swear. On my life.
Swear on my life.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
But I have a visitor.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.
Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
For instance, something like this?
Very nice. I'll take it.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
Right on.
G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
It's not enough.
So?
Okay. So we need a source. Where do we start?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Second name.
Sail.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
It's true.
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
But I haven't shot him.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
And how many are we?
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Go away!
Can you read?
Read it.
Where's Kader?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
A name?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
What is she saying?
Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
Why?
Take some time off.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
You did a good job, Charlie.
What about the will?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Yeah.
About three hours.
Cause?
What'd he die of?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
A massive cardiac arrest.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
What was the nature of the argument?
Sex.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Can you?
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
She's innocent.
Aren't they all?
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.
You've been following me?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!
I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Can I go?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Six years.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
How did he look?
Horrible. He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
No. She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
About a year and half ago.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Yes.
Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't. She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
-- And what did you suggest?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
No.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes. I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Yes.
What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
High school?
I heard him say it.
Then -- those are not your own words?
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
Did he make your life miserable?
Yes -- he did.
What did he say?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Who told you that?
He video taped you.
That bastard!
I've been to a few -- yes.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
You didn't know about it before that?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
Frank!
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Hello?
Hi. It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
Yes -- she did.
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
Sorry.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
Yes -- it would be nice.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You lied to me!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend. Where were you?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
I'm dropping the case.
You're a monster.
You killed him. You killed him -- and I got you off.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
But Your Honor--
Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I can back it up.
You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
Can't it wait?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
What's she like?
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
Yes.
I'll talk to him later.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?
Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me.
I'm not.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I know.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
Albert's got the stomach flu.
That's too bad.
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
Yes.
What time did you leave?
Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
Oh Jesus.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
Eeeww!
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
No treasure maps, huh?
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Well, there's a problem.
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
What?
'82.
Don't say that!
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Bar across the street.
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Pretty country.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Oh there you are.
No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
Want another cigarette?
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Francesca.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Where are you staying while you're here?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
I doubt that.
Why?
He's very... clean.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
What?
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God... You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
When?
You want to go back in?
What?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
My mistake. I apologize.
What made you ask such a question?
Francesca?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I would love to come for dinner.
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
It's Robert.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Oh, how is he?
How about if I set the table?
Sure.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
How about Italy?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
I bet you could do a book.
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
What were you like when you were younger?
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
I can't do this, honey.
What?
Uh-huh. And?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?! It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
I'm positive.
I'm going to miss you.
Want anything special for dinner?
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Franny?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
Apparently just before her death.
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
Outta my way, boy. Cinnabar? I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw --
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Then what do you care?
Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.
Is it true?
Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.
Died there? How?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
You didn't hear that? "Take him... " Something. "Bury him" or...
'S up?
Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much.
Just some flies.
You think that's really him?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn. That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick. She's family. And don't forget it.
Shit.
No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there?
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
Climb out to where?
Is this Hell?
That's what?
Looking to score?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him. Soon. Real soon.
Wh-wh-whooo?
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright. Everybody's happy.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
Where we'll always be...
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun. Get back on the curb! Now!
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Sorry, my brother.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
What it will be.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
What will it take? What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright. Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
And what's that?
I lied.
All the more reason I should be here.
It's alright, baby.
Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who? Who is he? What is he?
He'll kill them. He'll kill every last one of them.
We'll have to sneak in.
Told you so. Alright. We tried. Let's go home.
no really, let us help. We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
Naw. But they will be. They're the best.
How do you know?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park. Thanks for the help.
Careful. That's bad luck.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.
Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in. Who knows.
And you believe her?
Cinn?
I can't. Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Bill! Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
I can't find you.
We gotta jump!
We're here. Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Where are we going? You know I hate surprises.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.
You were just a kid.
I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people.
That's the past. It's dead.
Please...help me...
Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me...
What the hell do you want?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
You certainly traded up. ...the trophy wife. Nice lookin'.
I didn't sell it.
You're right. One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack. How old is --
No way man...
Not your style. Is it Eddie? Killing off your customers?
I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
What it is? What it will be, muthafucka.
Shit, that was fast.
I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Goddamnit! How many times I told you --
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Jimmy Bones?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
But the place burned to the ground.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
How could that be? The box was packed!
Illibent? Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft. That window was closed.
Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
Evidence of what?
Shit! Damn dog. We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa. Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
That's right, I know. I fucking know.
Know what?
Open the case!
All right! Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The next one blows off your dick.
You're a dead man! A fucking dead man!
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar? What is this?
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't. I can't.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
So, you just got out?
Not bad. What for?
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck! Fuck! How did you ... Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
They were early.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
No! They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
What?
It couldn't have been.
It was him. I'm positive.
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
The money? The money's gone.
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
He didn't see you, did he?
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
Caesar ...
Tell them! Tell them!
... maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good. I hate to worry. I got ulcers.
I should be going.
What? How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
Another time.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.
Where is it?
No.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Are you okay, Violet?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Yeah?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
No, Cease. There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
It's Gino! It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
No joke, ma'am. Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
See? We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
This is a beautiful place.
Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator --
Who?
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.
Truck. Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really. I was referred to him.
Do you know him?
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?
I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Maybe.
Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
I had to see you.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
... I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
How did you meet him?
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.
He's a launderer?
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
The redistribution of wealth.
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
Shit, here we go.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.
What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
Fuck it! I think you better leave.
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
How much money?
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
Do you think you know me like that?
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
Then what? Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Gino Marzzone.
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
What did Gino drink?
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
An accident.
What if he sees you?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Not Caesar.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I won't.
It's me.
What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
okay, all right.
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
Hey, Caesar! You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie. No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
Done. We go now.
Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
Caesar wants me to stay.
Oh, God.
Mickey? What are you doing here?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
Mickey! Oh God, Mickey!
You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.
She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to Paris.
<u>No you're not</u>. You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
I won't ask again.
I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
Paris. I live in Paris...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
What is Treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
Are you Treadstone?
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Keep it.
Jason... They can't let you go...
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I don't know.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Right.
You have your passport?
I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
Paris?
Yes, sir... How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment --
Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane?
Yes. Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
Who? Who came?
His brother. You know his brother?
Right. Yes. Of course.
It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane... Come right in...please...have a seat.
Really.
We thought you were gone for good.
Did you?
Was it the break-in?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus...
Please. I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
I want to go home.
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
<u>No</u>. No, that was too easy --
Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
I don't know. I don't know who I am.
What? Like amnesia?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
I needed a break.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...
Four-fifty. That's the address...
Looks familiar?
Where?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
I don't remember any of this.
Okay, so...
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- just --
-- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture?
He's dead isn't he?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong. I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
Nykwana Wombosi.
What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
You could do that?
xxxxxx.
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
Can I help you?
This your store?
Yes.
Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? --
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
What?
What the hell're you talking about?
You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
Wait a minute --
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That's the only angle.
What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something.
Sir...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What?
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
Where am I?
You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...ervices.
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ixed itself.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Tuttle! ... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh out yer nostril?
...Yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Sign here, please.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What do I have to do.
Er ... Thanks ...
It's reply paid.
Oh ... Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Layton.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
In fact, killing people -
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
If I can help you ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Gillian Layton?
Sam!
Jack!
What's the matter?
Sorry. Nothing. See you - I'm going to be late.
You are late.
Triplets.
Hello, Jack!
Er, I knew you looked different.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Ah ...
Layton! Oh shit!
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
Very smart.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
So what are you going to do about her?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack, she's innocent!
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack?... Jack?
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Bastard!!!
You stupid bastard!
What?
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Jack ...
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?
Ah.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Ow! That hurt!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
No.
Them?
Don't litter my cab!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why?
I didn't like it.
Why not?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
What's going on here?
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Looking for you.
No, really.
Really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
We've got both.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Look at that - right on time.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to open it!
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
They're gone.
Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?
Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
Try next of kin.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Here. What do I do next?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
What's the matter?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
Yes. NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!
I never signed the form.
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
What?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What is it?
What were we saying?
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Sam!!!
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Er, yes ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
This is an emergency!
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?
No, sir.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Are we?
A steak, please. Rare. Mother, I need to ...
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
Yes?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
But we can get one.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Sign here please.
What is it?
What?
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
He looks like a cop.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Frank Pierce.
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
No.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
Let's do it! It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Okay, what happened?
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
No way, man.
What's his name?
IB Bangin.
Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
You're not going to die.
What did you say?
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
Do you have any music?
What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Is he going to be alright?
He's very very sick.
I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
You never know.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
She should go home.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
You look so different.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
How is she?
Sleeping.
He's better, though, right?
It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
I need to sit down a minute.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
The ghosts--
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming. Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
Don't give me that look.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
No.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Would you like to come in?
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
Mr. Oh.
Whadda we bring?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Frank!
Do it!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I'm not hungry.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
He's crazy.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
What did I do to you?
Shut up a second...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
Wait.
What?
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going.
It's not loaded.
No. No.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
No. Don't worry about it.
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.
London. That's a promotion!
You know what I...
Hi.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
Okay.
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.
That's your full name?
Yes.
Yes.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Eventually rising to...
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
A half hour in the lobby.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Why do you say that?
Okay. Let's do me.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
Okay. Great line at the end.
Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.
We can cut back at the end.
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Watch? --
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.
Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Did you bring your grey suit?
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Thanks, Jane. Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
People phoned in.
Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
Don't go.
This is important to me.
What?
Yes, I guess. Yes.
I think you're the Devil.
No. You know that I'm not.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
Really?
I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
Ready.
Your hair's a little funny.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice. Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
That's it. I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Outside?
Anyway. I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Do it then.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while.
I understand. I'll go with you.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
We came from Washington.
Move away from me.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay. I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
Jane?
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
You don't have time. Not a chance.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What did he say?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
It's Aaron.
We could...
Play back the last line...
He said something about...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Should I...
Do you want him all the way to the car?
No stop where he's all besieged.
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
Bad manners.
No...no.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Good. He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
No. Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please?
Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
It's not opinion.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
Hi. I was worried I was early.
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
They said it would be okay if...
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Hi.
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You okay?
Nervous?
You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head.
Jane?
Yeah?
I'll wait for you till seven.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Nooo. Is it your story?
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No. Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
I'd like to know. I'll go along.
What happened?
Hi. It's me.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
Hi, again. Sorry about...
No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay. Good night.
No. Did he really?
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
That's yes?
Then give me a minute...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Then you should stay here.
This is very awkward.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling. Terrific work today.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Where's the bathroom?
That's enough. That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Well I'm touched. You're serious, aren't you?
Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.
What, right now?
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
I already told you I'm not.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Um...
A girl with a body like mine?
Walter can I ask you something?
What!
It's just an innocent question. Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Look - This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
Alright I got you, man. It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
See you later -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
You really like it?
Great! What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Let's see it.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Walter! Jeez!
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready? We've got plenty of time.
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
I like you very much, Walter.
Uh... ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter, I'm sorry...
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Forget it.
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
What?
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
Here you go, enjoy.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
It was.
What's this sauce! I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot... I like it, very much...
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
Are you alright?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
No. Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Why not?
Abstract? With his talent for realism?
Would you pose for me for free?
It's our road kill series. I take the pictures.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Look at that, man. Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
There's that weird dude again.
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man this is heavy!
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type. He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
People seem to like my cat.
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Go home.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
Well...why murdered man?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.
It's hot in here...
A show?! Like this Sunday?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard! Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat. I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
I can't talk right now.
What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
No...look I'm busy...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
How ya doin'?
Hello, Walter.
Hi. I know you! I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yes, you have. Can I come in?
Hm.
Did you see my cat?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure you don't want a pancake?
Police officer.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Huh?!!!
Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho! Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska! What the heck's wrong with it!
You are?
Wait a minute! What'd I do?
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf? Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Maxwell.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Hi.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast. Join us?
No thanks. Sounds good though.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why not?
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter. I get it.
What do you get?
Hello Mayolia.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
It's like...you've turned on.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee. Thanks.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
I was just straightening up the place.
Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
I look horrible.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I like it. Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow. You going?
I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Nice to feel needed.
Let's move out!
Nice game.
Man has a complex.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy! Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
Booo!
Suck!
No, we didn't.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man. That's the whole story.
It's coffee.
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey! She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches. They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Would you sleep with them?
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Let me in.
Invite me in, Pike.
Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
I'm fine.
Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Did you see a girl come by here?
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yes.
Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels.
Wheels?
My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky.
Oh, my God. Is that true?
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Yeah?
Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit...
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
What show is this?
I just want to see the basketball scores. It's important.
Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat.
I do? I guess I do.
Where were you last night? I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
No, you didn't. When?
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home. Like always.
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
This? This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God! A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.
You want some water or something?
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.
Well, stay here tonight.
Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
You sure?
Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
I know.
Thanks.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy? What's wrong?
Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing?
I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me.
A dress.
Dress, huh? What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
I'm going to the dance.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Bugs.
Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude. Blow it off.
Like what?
Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored.
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
Why don't we see a movie?
Beverly Center.
Excuse much! Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Where?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death.
What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I'm looking for you, actually.
What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not.
You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
Yes.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Everybody does.
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
Cramps?
None of your business. God.
All right. What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
What?
Uh... gym.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right. Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh. I thought... you lead me --
No. You don't do anything. I do it.
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
It was necessary.
Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.
Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord. What do you study in history?
All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
They were vampires?
Same one.
What!?!
He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
Five?
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
I can't work this.
We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I want to die.
Interesting.
All right.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Wait!
No THX.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That's the plan.
Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hey, Buffers. You look thrashed.
Thanks.
Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps.
Pike.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What's happening? What do you want?
So very much.
My parents have money...
Really?
The mark of the Coven.
I'm just a girl.
Bessel! What are you doing here?
Hi, Grueller.
What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
Could be.
You think so?
Got that.
Write that down.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
Well, I'm done. Are you done?
No --
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Well, I hope so.
I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
Omniplex?
I never thought of that.
Buffy!
Cool!
The don't. You kind of wish they would, though.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God! Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Environment. That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
All right. Take care of yourself.
I am.
Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".
I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.
Yeah maybe you're right.
You can learn to like it.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.
Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch.
This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
The right nostril. Good.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
Switch nostrils?
You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
How was that?
A little better.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup?
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
That's my leg.
I know what it is.
Fundamentals?
No! You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I think you're real cute.
I did.
What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
It's Skip, for you.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
That's great!
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Oh my... Don't leave...
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
See my hips?
Yep.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Damn.
Damn.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Crash...I want you.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
I want to be had.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
It's possible.
Why not?
I got released.
What happened?
I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he?
Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
What's it say?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake...
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
God bless you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
No, no, no. Put it back on and take it off slowly.
No, no, honey... first the shoes and socks.
The socks? It's cold in here.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You a God damn witch?
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief. That is desperation.
I got him on the knee!
You missed him!
Don't bump me.
It was a cocksucking call!
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Try it! Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker!
Beg me!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Beg me again!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
Why you shaking me off?
But he ain't seen my heat--
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
How?
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me? I love It. Teach me everything.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Write this down. "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
What's wrong?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You fuck!
You're a great catcher.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Good. Good. That's terrific...
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
Fear and ignorance.
No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke-- Good luck.
I don't know. I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Don't try me.
Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
She's playing with my mind.
Who you calling a "boy"?
No. If I screw up, I wanta do it alone. I'll call.
We'll be praying for you.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
Ain't he warning up?
No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four.
Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
What the hell's going on out there?
It's a damn convention.
What'you want, kid?
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
Crash ain't there. He never gets back till four or five--
Where does he go?
Well, I'd rather not say.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at yours.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
You were never my guest?!
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
A powerful man.
You got it.
I'm serious. No interference.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
...stupid things.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
...been right, but who knows?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Stop -
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Okay.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
702 472 1862.
Mm-hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
Dad!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
They payin'?
It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Eight.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
No, of course not.
Ohh!
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hello.
No, no it's okay.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's...
...very difficult to get in.
Hey, Ace.
No, I don't wanna come -
You should say so.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
All right.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
My wife?
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
Hey, she came to talk...
Please...
...to me.
...don't do it to me...
She came to talk to me...
Okay?
It's none of my business?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Yeah.
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Why?
What people?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Back -
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Ginger called me.
Yeah.
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Hello.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you? She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein... I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
No problem. Sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You go and put your things away.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
...position...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter. Listen...
It's always been our policy -
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Certainly. Senator.
Why not make them happy?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
Any change?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
She took care of the dealers...
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I - I - I...
You all right?
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
But as much as they loved her...
Oh, fabulous.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
What do you need?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Yeah.
Why do you need that much?
What are you talkin' a- ?
You can trust me.
Huh?
You didn't have to beat him up!
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
It's okay. Look... ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Hello.
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
What's it...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine. I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
You fuckin' whore!
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You want your jewelry?
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
You get down here!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I am not!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
Not gonna let me in?
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Oh, you are...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children!
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Yeah, okay.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You're firin' me?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
...worst possible time for me.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
No.
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
So, you're a righty?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Excuse me.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
When I left here with the money...
Mm.
...I got muscled on the street.
Yeah?
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home! Here. Get the fuck out of here.
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
You shut up.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Yeah, that works out.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Yes.
No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy.
Yeah. I think I want my money back.
Hey.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
I understand.
Fucker!
Can I go in?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Go get a bag, man.
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.
You just - Just stop him.
Pitch-black?! It -
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Hey!
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Now move along.
Leave me alone!
Here we go!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Nicky, I did -
Is that what you did?
I did - I didn't -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
He's comin' over.
Oh.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I know.
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
I know.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
I understand.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Mm.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay?
All right.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Yeah.
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
Pleasure. Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Tell me.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Sure.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Okay.
All right?
You're so nice.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
I'll be there.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just -
What? What?
Nothin'.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't -
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah?
Let me think about that.
Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Mm-hm.
You know?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Hm.
You did. You're right.
I did what you told me to.
Yes, you did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
Sure did.
No, he's not.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. Don't cry.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Nicky, please...
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Great.
...same outfit.
Yes!
Thank you. Very nice.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Yes.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Okay?
Yeah.
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Promise?
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
It means I got the money.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
Here.
He was just on the phone.
He called you right here.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
No, I'm gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to Nigeria. Yeah.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
I think that's it.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Look, there aren't... There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'?
Wow.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Two.
Mm-hm.
You know why, right?
Yeah.
Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Smarten up.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
Hey. This is Shelly.
And this is Stacy.
Stacy.
This is Nick.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
It's up to you.
Mm.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.
He's here.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Let's get out of here.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah.
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Tony.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
Again!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
I know, but that's enough.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I know it, I know it.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
The crowd bought it.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Works for me.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You know, nobody likes you...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Guilty. I am.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
What did you think?
What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Are you sure?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hmm. Not bad.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Women, huh?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time. Lewis Lane to the rescue!
God, can you hear me!
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Winning.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
Even the skylight?
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What a "drag."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
God-damn..
What did you say?
Ah, did you hear that? Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
I loved you.
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
Spooky.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
I'm a good mother!
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Enough.
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Hey, Captain God!
What did--?
You turned around!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
What?
Like you don't know...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Okay, deal.
You're late.
Mom? Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now! I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?
Nice breasts.
Where do you think you're going?
Any place.
This is one way.
I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful. There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
You could've made me lose my call.
So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I didn't hurt you.
Say something ...
She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
Will you two cut it out?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders. Shit. I can't hardly move my neck.
What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded.
You missed.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Can you make him stop!
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Now turn around. I'm going to cuff you.
Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists.
You switched license plates?
Bullshit.
That's your "rep."
Just hand up on the bitch! Fuck you, madam. And goodbye!
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit. There's the hotel. You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Got your badge?
Satisfied, Wiseass?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around. Pop a cap in him.
He took it like a man. Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Nels?
Any minute.
I was worried about you. Both of you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone. For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
Who smashed the phone?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I don't believe you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Oh man. These people mean business.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
No don't. You could lose me for good. Don't go through that tunnel.
I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn.
Please.
I'm with two friends now.
Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
"Theo?"
Forget who I am. Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello? It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.
Forget about us. Just save Rachel.
Where's the fucking recharger cord? Must be in her car, dammit.
How much time do you have left on it?
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
What do you do for a living?
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I didn't mean to. It's just the way I am.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was.
That makes two of us.
There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up.
Make a right. You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here. I'm getting out.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
No.
What's happening?
She's gone --
Don't say anything. Don't alarm them. Just go!
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
It's not your fault, Theo. You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
Wait just a minute. Our luck has changed.
What do you mean?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do. I do it all the time.
You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't talk. Don't talk!
What's going on?
Yeah, sure that's me. Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so. Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs. There must be an extension. Oh my God --
No. I hear them. They're coming upstairs. They know!
They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.
Lucky for them they didn't.
Thank you. God bless you for helping us.
Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes sir.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind. Not with them.
She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
All right. Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
It's locked.
She'll never be the same. None of us will.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.
You're going to let them get away with this?
They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun. I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
There isn't any such person.
The guy with the transplant.
Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
At least one.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
You timed that beautifully.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
L.A.P.D.
There's no way out for you. You have to deal with us.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
A typical fuck-up.
What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
I'm still okay.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact.
What's Nels' number?
259-7881.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's not good enough.
I'm handling it.
Both hands on your lap.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Took preparation.
Know what else is in here?
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who is this?
Who are you working for?
I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.
Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family.
They saw you kill the driver.
Where do we meet?
It's a nice day. How about the beach?
What time frame have you got in mind?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Some loyalty.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping. But nothing makeup won't cover.
Got a phone in that van?
308-9962.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here. Where are you?
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
It's your call.
Fucking "A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here.
Just relax.
I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on.
You'll see her.
I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I don't know what you mean.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight. So nine hundred to you.
Negative.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Stop the crying.
She's yours. What are we waiting on?
Count it.
Seems like it.
What's he doing? Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
Yeah?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
In the hills above Sunset. Just below the Getty.
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Why are you picking on me for?
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
I already called for an ambulance.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Can I make a quick call?
Government business?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Undercover.
The 405 is coming up.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Scottish?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Is that good or bad?
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
Hi.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Did I?
Don't be like that --
Thank you.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do you mean that?
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What?
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
You American?
No.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
Not me.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What was that?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
No, I didn't --
Where?
Give me that look again.
What look?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
No --
You want to know how I kissed him?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Why?
Drink.
What is this?
Can't leave me now.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Even now.
No...
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Don't.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Come on.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You do something for me, Dil?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
What?
You like me better like this.
Don't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You mean that?
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You knew my Jody?
Died...
You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
You killed my Jody
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
You like me now, Jimmy?
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Say it again.
And you'll never leave me?
Never.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
Dil!!!
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Fergus.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Fergus!
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
He's hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Jude?
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
Thanks.
What the fuck is this?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Back in a minute, Jody
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
And do you know why?
Why?
You OK about that?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Peter.
What?
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Just a girl.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Hey --
What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
How different?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.
Shut up, would you?
Fergus?
Yeah?
Why?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Is it bad?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Don't.
Help me.
How can I?
Go to sleep now.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Why?
Stop that talk now --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
What?
The teddy bear?
Don't run off, Jude.
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
And you know what?
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
All right -- where's the letter?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I could eat a horse.
That's right.
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
What about it?
What's the matter?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
When you come on, you really come on.
Adam --
What is it?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
I love you, Adam.
Yes, you told me.
Reggie -- I think I've found -- are you on?
With whom? Where?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
Reggie -- listen to me!
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Have some, please. I've got... ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
So that was it.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Very sweet.
Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Why not?
Because they're still here.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Agents.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Caf.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
That's the spirit.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
But no one actually saw him die.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes -- ?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's Charles!
Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
No.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
Back where?
Then who does?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Reggie?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Alexander.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Reggie -- listen to me --
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
The phone's ringing --
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
I think Tex did it.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Alex --
Hm?
I'm scared.
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
I don't believe it.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
What's its value today?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
In money.
Please keep it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
And if it is?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Not unless we're blind.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Leave me alone -- !
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
But his mother --
You loved him?
He was American?
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know. I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
I don't understand.
I was, too.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Oh, la.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh. Neither do I. Voil !
Voil what?
I found it! I found it!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! What's that?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Quitter.
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
How did you find out?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
What's going on?
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
What was all that?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Who said?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What was what?
We're here.
Where?
On the street where you live.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
Be careful, Peter.
What?
Go on.
That's all.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Stop that!
Please stop -- please!
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But what?
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
He knows everything.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's the matter, chrie?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
What?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
You do?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I never fucked Rod.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get all your CDs.
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
One more time.
I get the imports.
No.
Hi Jody.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
I want you to head right home after school.
Hi honey.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
Ok.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.
You are upset.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It was a she.
Are you sure?
You know her?
It can't be.
You were eavesdropping.
No I wasn't.
No!
We need you here. I can bring her in.
No?
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
What happened?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
Hello?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.
She works at a church?
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
Can you get inside?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
No.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No, you couldn't.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Your brother told us.
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
You're not?
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Go sit next to him.
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No! That's his table.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
No!
I promised I'd go right home after school.
You ok?
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I can't right now.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.
This place is empty.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Cut it out.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'll think about it.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
What?
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
What?
That's what he said.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Who is she?
Wait.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
The principal?
Yes.
Yes?
Yeah.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
What are you doing?
I got to go.
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
What?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.
help me get in the truck.
Oh...
...shit.
Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.
Shit!
It's a damn postal truck!
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Come on, Night Shift.
A little early for a delivery.
Oh...
...yeah. Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
...-ty.
Where's Sam?
Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.
Great.
That's my business.
No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy. Another fuckin'...
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart...
...and fair...
...two things Andy is not. Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Oh.
Why don't I--?
Aw! Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man. He's dead.
What did I say?
No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-tana.
Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Peace.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you
You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
...up.
Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me. Can you fix this?
You'd better coast through...
We're clear.
No cell.
Billings? No, no, no, no, no. We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
No way. We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
Hey.
We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.
God-...
...-damn!
Okay, okay!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no. Keep goin'.
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work! It's not even load-...
...-ed.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
All right.
Elvis is on ice again.
Okay.
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
No...
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift. You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--! The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
Yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
It was owed to me. You stole the damn...
...truck!
Shut up, shut up! It's beeping.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
You snatch that phone from me one more time, I'm--
Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up! Back...
Come on, old...
...Pete! Come on! There it...
...is, old Pete! Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?! You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide! Weighs over five tons!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Goddamn!
Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
I'm goin'. I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over! Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit. Come on, old...
...Pete! Come on.
Come on, old Pete. Oh.
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...
Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
I made it.
What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit. You gotta pass him.
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
Okay. That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?
Ho, ho...
Oh...
...ho!
Hang on!
Shit.
Go on.
No. Shit.
Come on.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Okay. Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Listen! Listen...
...to him! You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
Taking it down the hill.
You're not dangerous! You're crazy! I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway.
What?
Come on!
Keep still.
Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
What?
Okay.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
So you took his...
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally ranked.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it. So I split.
And things sort of just went downhill from there.
Listen, Arlo...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er. It was your friend...
...split.
Split? I wouldn't get ten...
That is loud! I'm
Whoo!
All right, all right. Hey, hey.
Hey. Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
A-And you owe me...
...man.
Are you all right?
They're takin' off.
Huh?
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.
Arlo! Arlo.
Come on!
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Come here.
...-natic.
That's why I didn't give it...
...to him.
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Hang...
Aw, shit. Would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
We!
I've got the real thing!
Here...
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven. You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
Stupid.
Shoot me.
What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.
What?
What?
We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
There's gotta be...
...another way outta here. Hey.
Hold this.
Hang on, hang on.
Let's go!
Got it? Come on, darlin'. I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
We're the shit. Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo.
Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us. Owes us.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face. I was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
Look. That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
But he didn't. See, that's negotiation.
No.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool. Be--
We're worried...
...about him.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...within five minutes.
What'd he say?
Your move. Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
And it won't be pleasant.
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
So...where's my truck?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...help you?
Yeah, that's my truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You-You can't let him...
...have it. You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What? Say again...
...Mason. I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice!
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here. Fine job.
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
However, you are also non-en-...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.
Whoo-hoo!
Colonel Vitelli. We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Is it--?
Looks like it. Yes, sir.
They were all wearing hardware.
Any of them Richard Long?
Doc-...
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...-bility.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now listen to me.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
You have my word on that.
All right. One more shot, provided... we're off the island tonight.
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
You'll kill us all!
Damn you, Long! My people are out there! Your people are out there!
Andrew...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
Is that why you're here? To blame...
...and the government.
Grateful?
...always done, Richard?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I--
Went away?
"Went away." I like that.
Almost quaint.
And let me guess. You failed.
So far, ye-yes.
Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I checked your release date. I never liked coincidences.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...-ians. But I assure you, Leo...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
I'll do it.
Get 'em on line, then stall. Long can't have gotten far.
There's nothing in here, sir. They got away with it.
This is it.
Move. This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
...comes up that road.
Well. It appears someone's been lying to us.
Radio the bikes.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
All right. Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl! Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Hit him again.
Vaughn.
There.
It's clean.
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay. Fur-...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
You can't fire on them. You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Shit.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
What about these two?
Get 'em in the middle of the dam.
I'm on it.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-ty.
Right. Tim Mason.
You know the suspect?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
Richard Long.
That's right.
...-fall.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Where's their protective...
...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain. Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help. Aw, fuck! Damn.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
...and a rifle. You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Doc...
...Long.
Doc Long. Yeah, I know him. Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Yeah?
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question - Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.
No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
Why? You're a nothing, nobody! Why?
You'd never understand!
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...-time, remember?
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
...he's smart enough to get you...
...somehow.
There's something else too.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Secrets.
Video lock.
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Go.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Kabula's out.
Hit it...
...now!
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel! Major!
Great. All right...
...we're gonna seal that tunnel! I want it air-...
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
It's not over, Brynner.
What's going on, colonel?
...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
...son.
Thanks.
And where are you going?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Uh-huh.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...colonel?
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.
Mason? No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc. Awful early, aren't ya?
Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Hey, doc. Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
...like a fish.
No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis. He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Tie a fly...
...back...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
...or it'll ignite.
Cold? Cold. How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.
Yeah, I just....
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Dr. Long!
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
...miles.
...you, Mason?
What? Say again, Ma-...
...-son.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
We've got the real thing!
Where are you now...
...Mason?
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
Mason. Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope. Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors. I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
...public drunkenness....
I didn't sell the boy any...
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...to talk, son.
Let me see your...
...hands!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
Listen, Pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right out-...
...side!
Wait. Listen to me, Pappas. If you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.
All right.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
Okay, doc.
The usual. Doc.
Get in
Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
Talk to me.
Arlo.
Oh.
We've gotta take out Brynner's van before they reach...
Do it now.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative. Negative.
There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Now! Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
'Course you do, Jake.
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
If that's what it says.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Sir?
I said horseshit. Horseshit.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
It doesn't hurt.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
How did she get that idea?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
None.
That's too bad.
What for?
Why is that funny?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.
My daughter.
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Avocado groves?
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Hello.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Oh they don't?
...No...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
You sure this is okay?
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
Yes.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
How do they do that?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Hello, Jake.
Summer colds are the worst.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guards?
You've done well by yourself.
Since when?
Congratulations.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What are you doing here?
Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't.
Isn't that your number?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
You accusing me of extortion?
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
Too late for what?
I know what he says.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Of course.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Do you know where she might be?
A complete surprise?
Yes.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
My husband's at the office.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I should talk this over with your husband.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
How did you find out?
My husband.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny. I think you better come with me.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Oh, yeah?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
That dam is a con job.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
And Hollis knew about it?
We got it. We got it, baby.
Is that unusual?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
They can't be.
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
As little as possible.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
What's wrong?
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
Where?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
What did he say? What did he say?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?
Give me an example.
It's possible.
Okay, give me the keys.
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's not tied up!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I am not!
She's too upset.
You mean she just found out?
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I took your husband's Buick... I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
Going somewhere?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What did you do that for?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How about a plane?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
I'm all right.
Walsh here?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I think I got something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
When did you come in?
Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh my goodness.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
I'm sorry. We don't.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Oh, good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I'm sorry, I --
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you. Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
You're a married man, am I right?
Yes...
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Mr. Gittes?
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.
The water.
What about the water?
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
Come again?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes...
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz. And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
Yes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
What's that, pal?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
Not exactly.
I'm working for his daughter.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
What are you doing here?
Fifty lire...
But you don't have any kids!!!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes. I want proof.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Yes.
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
You weren't expecting me?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Did you ever see her again?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
I don't care. I'll wait.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
My husband...you know him.
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...
Then where's the money?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Go on!
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Say, with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
He's a great guy - Leland. Why'd he ever leave New York?
And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?
Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very! Naturally.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Who else you been to see?
You know why? She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say! Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Are they standing for me?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
But, Mr. Kane -
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Was the show covered by every department?
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.
And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
I'm sure that's it.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily, you -
Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
I intend to find out.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
Oh yes, there is.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
Get out, both of you!
Charlie, please don't -
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
What's funny now?
Oh!
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier. Here.
A chicken?
No. But you're close.
A rooster?
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
Yes -
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Well, I -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie! I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Susan, it seems to me -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Don't go, Susan.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You goin', Mom?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Get Dr. Corey.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane -
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, sir.
Raymond -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Can't say, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia. It belonged to a king.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Charlie -
Charlie -
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
What?
I've got to think of Emily -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all -
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
All right.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Are you finished?
That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
I know you will.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I'll sign those papers -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
What's this?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Brief marriage! Ten years!
Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Or Rosebud? How about it, Jerry?
I know, but -
Thompson!
Yes, sir.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
How did you meet him?
What did you get?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
What the hell is that?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You're shittin' me.
It's not the same.
Jesus!
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Beats me.
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
She said not to come home until graduation.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
Dick.
Exactly.
So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
When did you get back?
Just now.
My God. I haven't seen you since...
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
And you said yes?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
So you're really getting married?
No.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Was I right?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
But you were.
I'm giving him his ring back.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
What about Sing?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I'm serious.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Just me.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Are you open?
Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
In a second!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
I can pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Excuse me, do you have...
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Why?
You don't want to know.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Seven months.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.
That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called you Brad?
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
That's frightening.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
I'm talking to myself here.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
All four?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
There's more?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Basically.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Wait.
She's in here?
What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
No.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
I know.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me?
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
Oh, my god.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Shut the hell up.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
Jesus!
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Around three or something.
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Am I right or what?
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How's your eye?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
To talk to you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
Helluva day.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Yes.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
You know him?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How do you know that?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
One seventy-nine.
Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
It's not my store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
Be careful.
I'm trying.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
The white kind.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Jesus... go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
What? What is that?
You're trusting.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
And I actually date you?
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
He requested this?
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
That's because I never had sex with him!
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Please calm down.
How many?
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I feel sick.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Really? You're the best.
You had to tell him.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Sure.
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Randal...?
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
You open?
Yes. I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
Can I have your name please?
Here you go.
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I do about three-fifty, four.
No way!
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
No, I wasn't.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
I hope it feels good.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there?
And... he told you all of this?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I'm not sad.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
The guy ain't here yet.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Which one?
Dental School.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Like hell you are!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
Willam!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
I will. Take it easy.
Bye.
Gabe! Hey, man! Gabe! It's Gabe!
Work! Don't say that word, man.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today. C'mon with us.
Did you catch that thunder?
That woulda been cool.
Answer the man.
C-4?
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Fuck you.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report. Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
It can't fly in this weather.
You know how the airlines are.
Looks like the Tower. It's a bad climb.
Go on, fetch.
Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I'm coming out!
No, stay off the line! You'll break her loose!
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
I did what I thought was right.
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me. If you can, get away.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie?
Near Freedom Falls. She went for help.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
There you go.
Two...
That's it, you look like a professional.
Four...five...
Nice and easy...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand! Grab it!
Help me! I don't want to die!
Do you see them yet?
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Gabe? Gabe, where are you?
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
We spent a night there one night...
Enough.
Hello, Gabriel.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Where've you been?
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I know...
I don't think you do.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
Listen to you... The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is... I'm late for my shift.
He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.
He can handle it.
What if he can't?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
Gabe!?
You got to go back now!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Let's be creative.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
What about you?
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Gabe...your arm?
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Nice view, huh?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe! Are you alright?
Can you see light?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him! He has no idea!
Pull it apart!
What?
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Frank! No, Frank! Frank!
Gabe!
Reach up! Do it!
Don't let me fall!
Thanks for holding on.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?! I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
I won't do it. No way.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it! I refuse!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
There's a lot more where that came from. You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
I burned it.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
He'll freeze.
What's he doing?
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch! You said you wouldn't kill him!
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Yeah...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
Go after her.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Oh, my God!
Right.
What the hell are you doing--
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
Travers! Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Kill me? Christ we're partners in this!
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Why? What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
He's alive!
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Rich...
Good morning, Walt.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.

Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
Phoned some friends, sir?
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Help you.

Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Thank you very much, sir.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Alex.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Who said that?
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.
Good.
Good evening, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well - I'm back.
Aye.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
No, brother. What d'you want?
What do I want?
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Crime?

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.

Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
How're you feeling this morning?
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Something like that.
Are you referring to the background score?
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Fucking hell...
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
Indeed.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Moloko-plus.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
D'you think we should do something?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
Shall we go to my office?
I'll take Sixth. It's faster.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
No. I got lucky with the lights.
You like Bach?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Let me guess. Clarinet?
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
It's no big deal.
This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
You like being a lawyer?
Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor...
Big case?
You never answered my question. You like what you do?
Most of the time.
You need a vacation.
How often you go?
Thanks for everything, Max. Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you! He's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
This your current address?
A deer?
You still carrying passengers?
You dizzy? You want to sit down?
I'm...fine. Fine.
You're kidding me.
Right through those doors. The man himself.
No.
Oh, my, yes.
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Lay it on me.
It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.
I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Tell me Vincent. Tell me what you think.
What?
I picked up a tail.
Can you finish on schedule?
Vincent. Do not cross me.
Twenty five?
Very generous.
Something going on?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
What are you gonna do?
You guys been holding hands?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
What thing?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
So? It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
Why didn't you tell me we had company? And what's your name?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Quite an achievement...
What's your name?
I'm in town for a short time.
Try?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm...in...the...room, here. Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go.
Oh. Oh, thank God, hey! Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
You're kidding me.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
I know you're out there! Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
I was just tryin' to...to...
Max? Maaax. Pick up, dipshit.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
You hassling my driver again?
Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
He'll keep calling.
It got crashed! I didn't...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to... Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four minutes.
Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Oh? How long you been doing this?
Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.
Twenty-four minutes! Man, you're hot...
We have a deal. What's your name?
Max.
He fell on my cab! From up th-th-there.
You always stutter?
You - you killed him?
You cool, Max? Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
No. You say you're cool.
Good. Help me out here.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
What?
His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!
Max. May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Max.
You listening to me?
Yes! I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One...
What about that?
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous. I'm the one with a schedule.
Try some deep breathing.
What?
You better?
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
58th and Central. You know it?
South Central.
Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Tonight it is.
Are you breathing?
Yes.
Music.
I Ching? You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing. I only met him the one time.
Who was he?
What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
Get rid of 'em.
How?
Please. Don't do anything.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant...
Why?
Who's that?
It was an accident. You're not liable. Tell him.
Don't take that. Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I can't do that. He's the Man. He'll fire my ass.
So what?
I need the job.
Lenny? You're an asshole.
Another collateral.
What?
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
I'm...what? Sorry?
Jazz. Music.
That what we're doing? Flowing?
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
Max? What are you doing?
Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Show up for what?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
She's in the hospital.
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Yeah? Like what? Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check.
Dmitri?
The man who hired me for this contract.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No. No way. I can't do this.
How long have you been a hit man?
Why?
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You get benefits?
No.
Washington and Holt. Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.
Would you have called her?
I don't know.
You had to kill Heller?!
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
One more.
There you go...!
That's what you said...
And you believe me...?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down!
Well. That was brilliant.
Max?
They said send you downstairs.
Who?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials and they're down there.
The sound of love.
But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.
Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mississippi?
<u>Jerry</u>? You didn't show last night. First time ever. Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Do you still ride?
Not for years.
You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
You bit someone's nose off?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
What's the charge?
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.
Hey... I can't control it. It's just, something that happened.
What is?
People do have heart attacks.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
For what?
You saved my life.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Oswald was an assassin. You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right. Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yeah.
Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man.
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Nothing scary there. Sorry.
That's it?
So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
Equitation.
I've been reading up on it.
Pretty scary, huh?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Who?
Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
What are you doing?
Was that who I thought it was?
Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
Shoot.
So what's the question?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
Did you see the van back there?
What van?
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Okay, I will.
You will?
I don't know what to say. I love you.
You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Holes? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
I don't. I know you wouldn't.
You look great.
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
After you. It's okay. I'm the one who left it here.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
My father's house.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah. I know what it's like.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I believe you.
They'll trace it.
I'm sorry.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Liza?
Get in. I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
What about you?
Geronimo is down.
It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
That's great. Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know?
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
I'm not sure what you mean.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it. On one condition. I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She --
That's not what I mean. I want to see her.
I don't know...
Then screw you. I'll rot.
Alright. You can see her. But she can't see you.
Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
I'm sorry. What was the question again?
<u>Why you</u>?
Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term. Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about truth?
The truth shall make you free.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
We're very specialized.
Fine. What the hell is going on?
Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
And what did I say?
A dog.
<u>My dog</u>. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed --
Where'd you get it?
You do recognize it then?
Not a man. Ezekiel Walters.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay. I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Working.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
Night after that?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Yes.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense. Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't like it. Something's wrong.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink. Here to I.D. Fletcher. They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
You're welcome! Spooks. So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Agent Lowry.
Wasn't my idea.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
What gave me away?
And Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.
Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
We've lost contact.
Pull the plug. Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
He died... ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent.
Glad to have you, David. How's the new office?
Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
I disagree.
Pepsi? Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Oh? How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Really? Congratulations, by the way.
Now exactly. It's... complicated.
No doubt.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
No... You're not. But the price has just gotten too high.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
What is it? What's happened?
We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
David --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What?
You...
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
Right. Well.
What would you have me say, David?
Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What?
We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
And?
No primer.
J39 Z186...?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Hydrogen times pi... Got it. Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Dr. Cullers?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
Ellie. Pulsar?
1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
It's beautiful.
Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
And a hundred mile airspace.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Is it possible. Yes. But --
Thank you, Doctor. Now --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
I can't move any smaller.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
Pensacola.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real. None of this is.
So who -- what -- are you?
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
Am I one... or many?
So. What happens now?
Now... you go home.
It's time to go home now.
No. Please.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
A page-break signal. A period.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
Yes. A shame. Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Ellie. Arroway.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Actually --
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.
Ellie --
Ellie.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
What day?
Champagne please.
I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
And mind, yes. What are you --
I flinched.
Do you love your parents?
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
Did you love him?
Yes. Very much.
So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I don't think so.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
Something like that.
I read your book.
Really.
Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
It's getting late...
Ellie --
An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?
So. The final countdown.
The final countdown.
What...?
I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are my other options? In fifty years? Never?
Please --
And then what? Then you'll be safe?
I can't hear this now --
Hi.
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Oh my God...
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Git your shovel and git to work.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
I'll make it a dollar.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Yeah.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
Tell us about it.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I don't know, Boss.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
Git to work!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Borrowin'.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Whatcha got?
Pair'a nines.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
What's the writing say?
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Cuter again.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Well, how far didya get?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
One, two, three...
Stop that.
How about you tryin' to make me?
He'll never make it.
What are you talking about?
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
No. No chains either.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.
It's good medicine.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for. <u>Forget</u> it.
Oh God. I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here. <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God. I must have looked horrible.
What? What'd I do?
When are you going to call them?
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv. I've got a date.
It's almost six. And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
You bastard!
Where have you <u>been</u>? What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
He was lying.
I thought he was lying.
What pattern was that?
The first two murders.
What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Who are you?
Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I was? How you spell that?
Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
What Friday?
Where is it?
The door was already open...
We know... Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
Ah ha. What did he want?
Something personal. Is he bothering you?
You come and visit.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
In jail.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
We'll keep talking. Until they get here. Then...
Who is this?
I think this is number three...
Ring the gong, he goes. Poor impulse control.
Is he out?
Who?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
Nothing.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
He's going home. He slept over because I was a little anxious...
We've got another one.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Ruben.
Hello, Ruben... So that's that...
There were needle marks. But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Why should I trust you?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
You're exhausted. Let me get you a brandy.
Who's the married man?
Yes. Dahmer! And after that...
Bundy. That's the last one in your speech...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
I know 'Halloran.' What's the rest of it?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
I'll get a locksmith.
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes. I have to go...
Don't hang up!
<u>What</u>?...
Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Open the door. Please.
He was in my apartment!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Okay.
I was.
I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
Who came in after you?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late. You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
You came in there with this attitude...
Nada. Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
What about her arms?
Look at her legs.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What's Abba?
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You messed with the scene.
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
There was no sperm.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues.
What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
Where you going?
Helen Hudson...
What the hell you need her for?
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Give me Ruben back...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Detective Niccoletti?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Where were you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
There, that's better.
That's going well, then.
And her husband? What was he?
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I thought that was you, up there.
One of your suitors?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I'd like to go back. James...
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
You haven't told me where we're going.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Are we allowed to park here?
No.
Can you drive?
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care of myself.
Then, you should call.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
What's up with you?
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Please, Letty.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
And the party?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready. The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
What do you think?
Ecru.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding. My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Yes.
But what about Beast? Who'll...?
I'll see you soon.
Tomorrow?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
You too, Mom.
Which flowers did you order?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Mom, please.
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job. Couldn't you congratulate him?
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Don't be fresh.
Letty, you should be in bed.
There's a spider in my room.
It had this red spot on its back.
Green spot.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
To talk? Well, OK, that might be good.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
Yes? Go right ahead.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal. We all compare.
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
I wasn't hungry.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic. He's very romantic.
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
Good God.
A small price.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks. Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Wow. I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Do you?
I do.
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Well?
Tell me all.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
So, it's over?
Furnished?
I better make a list.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B. Check it out.
Wow.
I love the pillows.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
I like it. But Headlines are better.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Michael.
Not yet.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Yeah?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Sounds grim.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
It doesn't matter. It'll work out.
Promise?
Promise. As long as we have steak.
The store was busy.
You got wine. That's great.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bye, Uncle Cort. What's with the lie?
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Why'd you tell?
Silly? Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom. Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.
And all the plans we have.
But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm sorry. I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
What are you doing? You're going to be late.
You don't have a fever.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
You can get out of the dinner.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Yes, I suppose so.
No.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
No, you've done a perfect job.
No, no.
So will you?
What's so urgent? You've got me worried.
No...
I've met someone else.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Here's the ring.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Oh.
How's work going? Are you back at school?
Getting back.
I heard about your friend.
What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I think I've heard this speech before.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Office work?
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Agent Hadley.
Do you know who this is?
What are you doing?
Okay. Okay. I believe you.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Where are the tapes?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero. That's all I know.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Not today. Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
Hey man, you can't do that!
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
You're there now?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
You've already robbed the safe?
Oui.
Where's your brother?
Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Hello?
It's Daniel.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Good. I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something. A drink? Coffee?
I'm good. Really.
-- Super what?
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Okay. How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
And nothing. He's just feeling us out.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
He missed three weeks.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I guess we're going to find out.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Thank you.
Tonight?
For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Yeah. We just go home.
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
In English. Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
What for?
That's an excellent plan. Very comforting.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
Good idea.
It's not?
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for? He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What'd you get?
What?
Can I trust you, Sami?
You haven't answered my question.
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
What do you want now?
Guns. Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Why haven't you turned us in?
How much?
A thousand dollars?
Yeah?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
What?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
They were all French guys.
French guys? You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Okay boss. Where are they?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Can you believe that guy? What a moron.
Good song though.
What'd you guys find?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
I don't know. I didn't look.
The map said to go left.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
There has to be.
What do we do?
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
What about transportation?
No, I didn't.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
They don't serve wine here.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.
We've got to get out of here.
Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't trust anyone these days.
I am not comfortable with this. I'm not a good liar.
I'll drive.
I'm the driver.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No. How much?
How about Canada?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
It's good.
God, I want to go home.
The baseball is mine.
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
How's my brother?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.
What happened?
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah. It's mine.
No. It's mine.
The hell it is.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How?
No shit?
I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
How are we going to do that?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
The money isn't here.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.
Algeria.
I can't even hear myself think.
What does arresting us get them?
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
I don't remember. I was drunk.
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay?
What's this?
Okay. Okay.
You're back!
How's the arm? Still sore?
Much better. You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy. You should have killed her.
I didn't have the heart.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Yes.
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
On guard!
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
I'm just playing around.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
You're already a thief.
That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
Hello. What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Please sit.
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
Put them down.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
You're too young to understand.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You're not married, are you?
What do you think?
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I've missed you.
How so?
You're doing calligraphy?
You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
They forced me to marry!
Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
You know about Lo?
Where is he now?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Not another lecture! On guard!
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Give it back!
Kneel!
Never!
Lo?
Let's stop a moment.
Give it back!
You've got quite a temper. It's better this way.
You coward!
No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb?
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again.
Go.
Jen...
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
It has. How's business?
Good. And how are you?
I left the training early.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Jade Fox? Impossible.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Have you questioned him yet?
No, not yet...
That's not what I meant. I don't care about the sword.
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Then, why did you come?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night.
I knew she would intrigue you.
That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken. We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.
They're gone.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
This is a delicate matter.
What do you have in mind?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie. I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one." What file?
Don't thank me. Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass."
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Fucking A, my friend.
You, my friend, are dead. I saw your body. You got buried.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thank you. For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much. Did you cap off Funboy.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others. Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
You're welcome.
Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Fun -- look at that guy...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
You look like a rock star without a job.
Who?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite.
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
No.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place. I hope.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Mom tried to cook.
I don't know you.
You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
You buying? He kinda wanders around. You'll see him if you pay attention.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me.
Last Halloween, eh? Yeah... Yeah, I remember. I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
Do you know what you destroyed?
That's ancient history.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Top Dollar.
Another jolly nickname?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
How the hell did you do that?
Neither.
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember whatshername?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Shut up.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k. Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
What... the hell is that?
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
No shooting.
Who got himself what?
One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The "hit".
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
Are you okay?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
So what year are you going into?
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You a lesbo?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
How do you know I've been with several women?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
I sincerely doubt it.
How's the water?
About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Shut up.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
No thank you.
How are you today?
Give it up.
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.
Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
I'm... I'm alright.
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again. What are you up to today?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
Okay.
Oh please.
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do.
You must take me for a real idiot.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I do not.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
No.
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
- none taken -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Any ideas who it could be?
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
The football stud?
I don't think that bothered him.
What do you mean?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Outstanding.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
I'm in the bath, mom.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Are you for real?
Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.
Okay.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
No.
Well do you like him?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Who is it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
Well... not exactly.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
What do I do then?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
It's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
You think?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I do.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Hi, mom.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Who told you?
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Whoa!
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Positive.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Is she with you?
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I told you I don't know.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Ronald?
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Racist piece of shit.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I don't find this very funny,
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Care to make a wager on that?
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Be more specific.
You can put it anywhere.
Even there?
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Blow me.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
Shut up.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where is she?
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
No, tell me.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Some other time.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I thought we should celebrate.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I can't thank you enough.
You will be discreet about this?
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
Nope.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Hey Ronald.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
I love the smell of pine.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
You get your wish!
What are saying, darling?
What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Mommy --
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
It's early yet.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should. 3000W?
Something's haywire,
What do you mean?
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Did you hear the child out?
I'm never unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
What?
It's your play.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
Hello, Amy.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
I didn't forget.
But wishes don't come true.
Can't you tell me later?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
They ran away.
Now Amy
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy, it's true.
No, I didn't.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?
Yes, darling.
What'd you get for Christmas?
I don't know yet.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
A princess?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
There's an oak leaf. Add a maple.
Your children?
All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You mustn't be afraid.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
You?
Yes, Amy.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
It's a pretty ring.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
And Amy mailed them?
I like to see her happy.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
I've been working out.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Nearly four.
Jennifer?
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Maybe he's just shy.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Maybe they have to pee.
Where?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
So did you do it?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
At least your PMS is over.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Are those Mark's?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Give him the tampon test.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
How'd it go with the cop?
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Get rid of him!
Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.
He's been here all night?
What happened to his tooth?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
What? Why'd you do that?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You expecting someone?
No.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter knows something.
I think I just got my period.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Guess she never found true love.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I'm cleaning my stove.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I guess you'll find out.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
No. I won't let you do that.
I think George knows.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Hello?
I know.
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
You're kidding, really?
You hungry?
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Well, whattdaya think?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
What?
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Look what you did!
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Where'd you get the bike?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
It's a matter of life and death.
This really isn't a good time.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
You busted me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
You wanna get some coffee?
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
It's stupid.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
What are they for?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. I was doing my laundry.
Was there anything in that washer?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
You had a date with Carlton?
No, why?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
No, I got it. It's okay.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Except Mark of course.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
You at least owe me the truth.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
How do you know?
Be careful!
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
I think I'm a werewolf.
I ate a guy last night.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
We can get a warrant if you like.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Take some allergy medicine.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
He was found a few blocks away.
I told you she was innocent.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
What?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
He means the last that we know of.
What are you talking about?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks. Just some pills.
Sell maps?
What of?
The city. I need to get to the ocean.
How long have you been here?
Maybe ten minutes... Thats strange.
What's he doing here?
Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
The other one?
His wife.
Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Police. Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
Doctor! What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.
Really? And how is his state of mind?
You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
Please, they'll kill me...
In there.
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Its extremely important to my investigation...
Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.
Dammit!
Sorry, sir.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Im your new assistant.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
Good.
You wont regret this, sir.
You typed this report?
Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Who is it?
Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Yes, sir. <u>Everything</u>?
Where are we going?
People... after me.
Who?
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
Where do you think this goes?
Can't let you in... sorry.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...
Look! This is a good one!
What is that door?
Which one?
Such a joker! Like your father.
You see it?
Yes.
Where does it lead?
A book of delusions. Anything else?
But I...
I see. The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
No. I, ah...
Someones after me.
Then we must call the police.
Dont kill me!
Shut up!
You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
Yes.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Known me for long?
I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that?
Horrible...
I'm nothing then.
Can I get my life back?
What are you doing?
I have to go...
You're a liar!
No, it's the truth.
Why?
It's a trick.
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
What is it?
It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
How do I get there? Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
You're kidding?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
You're nothing. Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
I'm... not... nobody...
You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
I can't believe he'd do this.
Where's the girl?
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Till what?
TilT we figure something out.
Look, everything can be handled. We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Up and around? Soon?
A condition...
We think so.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Fine.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke' story...
Clean.
What about the wife?
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Uh, let me get back to you...
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
It's a homeless shelter.
Oh. Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
No!... WE didn't anything...
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.
Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It's fine.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.
You could buy it on payments.
Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
That'd be great.
You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Extend things?
What happened?
Will he be alright?
No.
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
In the car.
A teleprompter.
The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
At a press conference.
What?
Thanks, I wrote it.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Let's call it a night. I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
This is from the people of Burundi...
Oh... Thanks.
What are they?
Fertility beads.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
What?
Really?
How'd you get started?
Mr. Kovic. We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job?
Yeah.
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
You're kidding.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
Who?
The Vice-President...
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What?
I care about the homeless.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
... . Ellen.
I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
That was quite a thing you did today.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh yeah? Me, too.
You're leaving?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
Where's home?
Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff.
You1re leaving, too?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me. I'm okay from here.
I don't mind.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
Are you hungry?
What?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
That's a secret.
You have a lot of secrets.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
Yeah. Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I know.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What's wrong?
You really believe that?
Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Yeah. He's a good man.
Hi.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change. You like it?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
So this is it?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're all set, sir.
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.
Oh yeah. Did you take care of later on?
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Then why did you come here?
Help me get him to the boat.
What is it?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
What is it?
Quiet!
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Curse?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Datura.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
What is it?
How long do we have to watch him?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
We got a boat.
What?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
What you wanna do?
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
He is dying. He knows it.
You are dying, too.
TONY....TONY....
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
It's because of me.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Where are you going, Tyler?
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Step up here, Tyler.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
No, sir.
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Tricks...Jesus...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, I'd better find Patsy. Say hello to Mutt for me.
Sounds boring to me.
Don't come.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
So don't goddam come! Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
I don't think they're in school.
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
How was dinner?
Thigh man? Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I don't know. I don't get it.
Come on. It'll help you get Chris.
It will? How do you figure?
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
Well?
So?
How'd it go? Did you read it to her?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right. I'll try anything once.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh! Eat it, Dalton!
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well...
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda. You idiot.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Yeah? Like what?
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
It's such a strange name! Won't you tell us what it means?
I told you, that's a secret.
I think he's sweet.
You know what really excites me about you?
But...
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton. How's your father?
Doing fine, sir.
Yes sir. We were just talking about that.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Yes... sir.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"? I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Sure, but Cameron asked me too. Anybody mind including him?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Sure.
Who's in?
Charlie...
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?! How did you do that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
What good will that do?
Maybe he'll have some advice. Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
This is stupid.
It's all right, Chet.
Chris. We got it. Let's go.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
It does? What?
Don't stop.
Stop what?
What are you doing?!
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
So, uh, where are you in school?
That's your sister school, right?
Sort of.
Hello?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
No.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
But, Chris...
carpe breastum. Seize the breast.
Chris!
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
But I love you.
Just like that?! You just knew?
Look, I've got to go. I'm gonna be late for the play.
Are you going with Chet?
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Yes sir.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Yawp!
Again! Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
A madman. Perhaps he was. What kind of madman? Don't think! Answer.
A crazy madman.
I... I close my eyes. His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain. What was the Dead Poets Society?
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Okay.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Isn't there an easier way?
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
You really think I should forget her?
Damn. Damn! If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
All right! What'd she say?
All right. Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad. Probably in their nineties or something.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I gotta get to the tryouts. Wish me luck.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Yes sir. I'm sorry.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Weird.
I say we go tonight. Everybody in?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream. I think I know.
What is this, a midnight study group?
Look at this.
What is it?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
Well, you've won the booby prize. Don't expect to like it here.
So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Want to come to the study group?
What is it then?
Yes. But
Put what? Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
What?
I've found it.
Found what?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
A play, dummy.
I know that. What's it got to do with you?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Come on, that's impossible.
Horseshit. Nothing's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first? Maybe he'll say yes.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon. You coming?
Er No.
No? What do you mean 'no'?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Sssh. That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
From you?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
It's my birthday.
This is your desk set. I don't get it.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground. God, I love this!
No thanks.
Lots of girls. The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit. Where were we?
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Visit from my father.
Do you have to quit the play?
You the Captain?
Yes.
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
He's the owner...
It's not going to help us!
They are...they are everywhere.
Who?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
What the hell are you talking about?
And what? These things are octopusses?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
We were talking about my schedule...
You're going to have to get a new one.
Not an option.
Where are my men?
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?
That's where my boat's moored.
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
I saved your life is what I did!
What other bunch?
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
What are you people talking about?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
I don't know where it is!
Got it?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Like cattle...
You're saying they can think?
What's the matter?
What is it?
A meat locker.
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
Finnegan...
Yeah...
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
Can we use our indoor voice please...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
What did you do the my kids!!
Me??
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...it's okay...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
It's okay...come on...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
A little to the left...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
I have been.
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
She's gone...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
What the hell does that mean?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Maybe plans changed...
What was that?
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
What is it man?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked you?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
That's mustard!
What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
Get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Here. Here we go. Here's to you, Nick!
Yes, Albert?
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's going?
We're all going.

Here's to huntin'.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Ammo! Get the ammo!
It is not!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
They did too!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

It's Nick!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?

Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Let's go!!!

You don't!

I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She does not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
It won't open.
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
That's new, isn't it?
Whee-uu!
I got delayed. I --
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Married?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
You're back.
Yeah.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
No.
I have to go.
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
Ah yes. Of course. To the girl who waits.
I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Yeah.
You are his friend.
Where is he???
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Everybody love Linda.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
You mean...?
You like to call me Linda now?
Linda, yeah.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
She's in back.
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
Naw.
You know a guy named Merle?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Holy shit!
Hey, Nick...
Where's it gone?
Nick! Hey, Nick! Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Rough, huh?
Rough. We didn't have to do it, John.
No?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
No?
Sal.
Talked to Sal? Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Biederman!
Linda...
Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
What?
Will you marry me?
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Sure.
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
No.
How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Frost.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
No-o-o!
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick?
What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I'm just so lonely.
C'mon. I've got the car.
You seem... disturbed.
Playing.
Playing?
We... Three bullets.
Who the hell is he?
You can do it, Sal.
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Merle?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal! Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
You should have put that on last night.
I know.
That way it sets.
I just wait. You know?
Huh?
So do I.
You do?
You think about it?
The shot?
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
Is he from here?
Hell no!
You think we'll ever come back?
From Nam?
Merle --
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Hunt with Vince?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We gotta play with more bullets.
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
How many bullets?
Three bullets -- minimum.
No. No way!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
How's Linda?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
You wanna bet?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
No!!!?
No.
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Where's Vince?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Right.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
Listen, Nick --
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
Where?
It's Merle, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Phantom Mary?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Well, who'd you get married to?
Cynthia! Sure.
That's who.
What the hell's that for?
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Naw. Uh-huh.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No.
No!
Never one.
You're full of shit!
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck I did!!!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up.
Down I would say... What would you say?
Down.
Up a little there... What would you say?
That's him. Simon Doucet.
Jesus. Sweet Jesus. We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Yeah?
Talk fast. Polls open in half an hour.
Michael called yesterday. He wants to take Willy for the summer.
What did you say?
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Who is it?
My man Dubbs.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
Speak up.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea. You look like shit.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
What's this?
Mug sheets.
Edicon system made these. Ages, photographs. We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it?
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
You can't kill me. I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
I'm wasting time.
What is it? I'm about to go on.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You have no evidence. Arrest this man.
Tell Doucet that. What was his rehabilitation training?
You okay?
How do I look?
Okay, that's all folks. Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Sir---
Need help?
I got it. I got it.
You sure? I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Nobody's looking.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Not the 'T' word.
Are you a cop?
Yes.
I'm ready.
But Sergeant...
Does it drive itself, too?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn. The pedal for gas...
I have to go home, Sanchez.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?
I'll inform dispatch.
There's no time. There are civilians in there. It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure. We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off. He's the Commissioner.
Wanna come?
Thanks. Want'a bite? McDonald's vegiroll.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Give me a break. I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Hey, buddy...
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down. That's when we'll get him.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking?
Why?
It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you?
Married?
Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
What's this place?
Yeah.
She's pretty.
You need anything else?
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No. Talk English. Then I'll understand.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
I'm serious, Wade. This case is important to me.
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
Two lousy smokes. You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You're not pregnant, are you?
What else did he get?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
What's this?
Sanchez...?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
...What are you talking about...?
Your girl. Being a cop will be rough on her.
...Have you been drinking?
You okay?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it? Your legs? Hands?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
No. I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Demolition Man.
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
Yes.
I'm going to be a policeman.
What's your name?
William Simpson. I like Willy.
Bye. Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
Funny. Would you like to buy me a drink?
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Jabez -- ?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel. What did he do?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
I didn't.
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Well, I wouldn't mind. But my name's Daniel Stone.
Gee -- that Fair --
Guess there will, if it says so.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Young man -- you got me there.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Why? It don't hurt.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
No! No! I won't.
Mama!
But I like the new one better.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Howdy, Hank.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
What Grange?
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
Never mind. What's your name?
Belle.
Stevens!
No, Stone!
-- in gold.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
No, you're not.
Now run along, Daniel.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven. No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
But what becomes of our souls?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
The seventh day of April --
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Why not -- ?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Jabez -- help!
I think his leg is broken.
Oh, Jabez.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Who is it?
Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary--
Jabez ...
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Jabez!
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
But I'm glad to be home again --
Tired?
Worried!
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
I'll never get my washing done.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'm serious.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Mary --
Well -- I -- I-
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
I am going to lock him up.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Why don't they come --
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ... Mary!
Jabez!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Helps sometimes to say it.
What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
Well -- that's comforting! Supper.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
You'll be a father any minute now.
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma! ... Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Let him try it.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
What's that?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You aren't angry with me?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
It is.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Hullooo!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I want someone to talk to ...
Why don't you?
I'm John McClane.
The past six months.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
It's okay, it's okay.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan. You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I'm in charge here.
One of yours?
What's happening?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
The police...?
John.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
Nothing...
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money? What kind of terrorists are you?
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest. Are you still there?
You...you're an American?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm a cop from New York.
New York...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right? John McClane.
Hans. Your Hans.
I'm going to count to three...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
Three down, four to go --
I...have a request.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Oh...Where does he live?
I'll be a few minutes. Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Holly Gennero?
Relax, Ellis. I'm off duty.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al? Al, you there?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Yeah? What's the odds?
They way you drive, I can see why.
I...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
Roy?
Al. Man, you were my rock. I couldn't have made it without you.
Bullshit.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
How do you know?
What's going on?
Is that him?
This is --
Gene -- you smilin'?
No. I never smile any more.
So whatsa deal?
They jet's comin' out. But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
Aw, hey...
You'll be okay.
Hey, Sonny! I'm watchin' it on TV!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Hey, don't take the car!
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jenny?
He says he doesn't know. Why don't you cook whatever's there?
What guns?
The robbers in the bank. They got guns?
Yeah. A lot of guns.
Well, stay away from them. Don't get close.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Hello. Hello, Leon.
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way. I'll tell you.
Well.... huh ...
Ooohh....

You're really crazy.

So! Sal is with you?
Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow! Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am. I know!
Would you do something for me? Please?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Oh... they're fucken crazy. That's a snow job. Don't listen to that shit!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Shit...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right. Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
I don't have a choice.
You don't have a choice?
No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... who's on the phone?
They won't talk to you.
Are they on the phone still?
That's good then. You've found something.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right. See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Yeah... I'll write a song. Ha, ha. I don't know. Life is funny!
Leon? Whatsa matter? They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
I'm afraid.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
I don't know what to say to him. I can't.
Yeah.
What are you doin' in there?
What a fuckin' comedy! WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here. What do we do now?
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Right -- got ya. Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
What do you want to know that for?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Sonny-boy, one word?
One word. You won't find it in the phone book.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I frisk you?
You frisk me.
Okay, give us the women.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Calm down, you're not ...
He wanted to kill me!
Sonny, be reasonable!
Okay, what do you give me?
What do you want?
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ... also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it. Charlie! Six pizzas!
Yeah?
Is he all right? Is he all right?
He's all doped up.
We're all set at Kennedy.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
What's the matter with you?
This is it? What am I gonna do with this? Holy shit!
It's all we got.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Where's the back door?
Now, you -- what's your name?
Mulvaney...
Well, they go to guard school.
You got kids?
What if I take you with me?
What?
Where's the air conditioning?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'll be God damned if you will.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Special to me, too.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
No you don't.
I'm sorry.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Would I hire you?
Yeah.
Why not?
Mister Mulvaney?
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No. I had some legal training, but...
You got Bank Americard?
What is it, Sam?
Everything's all right? You okay?
You all right?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah. Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Thanks again, Sam.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny! Good luck, you know?
You were terrific, too!
How did you know your son was involved?
It was on the TV.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped? Why?
No! I'm not kidding. Don't you understand? You're pure!
Pure?
My body? What for?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole... He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
Let's go, Sonny.
He's gone?
Where's the money?
Goddamn women...
It's the cops. Shit!
You mean that?
What?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
He wants one.
Dead or alive?
To show that we're negotiating.
All right ... send them the guard.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
Sonny -
Yeah ...
They're trying to come through the door!
It's the FBI. He wants to come in.
Sal?
What'd he say?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt. Hey, Sal, you okay?
Okay, Sonny.
There it is, Sal. Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want them all.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Wait a minute! What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
What's wrong?
Sonny! Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
What can he do, he's clean...
Okay - you got your one.
That's the jet. You give us one more, now. That's the deal...
I ain't eaten all day. I just realized it.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
I am.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Listen, I'll never make it. I'll have to go to the toilet.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Oh - Maria!
What are you trying to pull?
I forgot she's in here.
Hey, you okay?
He's got diabetes. He's not a well person.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck! We did it!
Oh my God, mother!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Not now, Mom, please.
What'll you do? Come out.
I can't, Mom. If I come out Sal will kill them.
Oh. Run.
What the hell for? Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...
No!
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
You're news, Sonny ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
You could give up.
Oh yeah? Give up? You ever been in prison?
Of course not ...
This is Drake Bishop.
How much?
Morning.
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
<i>I forgot.</i>
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
So what?
What about your toe?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
What?
Hello?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Yes.
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Okay.
I've already formulated a plan.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Yep.
Where is the money?
I don't know.
That's the rumor on the street.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Chi-Chi! CHI-CHI!
Is that you, Domino?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Is that the decoder?
Must you use that awful word?
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
God help us. God help us all.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Really? Did you play in a band?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Hello?
Can you tell?
Cool it, Choco.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
There are no bond certificates.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Many times.
Do you know where Danang is?
Not really.
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
Where is Domino?
You were good.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
How you be?
I be. I'm living large.
You don't like Public Enemy? It's the dope shit.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I don't like anything else.
Check this out. Y'know Sal's.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
Yo!
Yes?
You almost knocked me down. The word is "excuse me."
I'm gonna leave now.
That's not even true. I just want a slice.
What did he do this time?
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
So, in other words, you are not down.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Don't come back, either.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What da fuck! Are you deaf?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Mookie.

How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
I'm cool. I'm cool.
You the man.
You the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Make it plain.
No!
What can you say?
Squash it.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I thank you.
Good morning.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed. You almost got yourself killed last night.
Where did you sleep?
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
Mookie.
Gotta go.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
OK. OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
Eddie Lovell.
How old are you?
Ten.
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie.
What makes Sammy run?
Fifty cents.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up!
Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore? I loves ya, Jade.
Do me a favor. Go to work.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Don't worry 'bout me. I always get paid.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
What responsibilities?
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'm coming.
No.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Stop tripping.
No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips.
What are you so worked up about?
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
Innocent!
You are too crude.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I'm getting paid...
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Jade, you're late.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
Yeah, me too.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Sorry, comb got caught.
Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an old woman.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I'll do.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
C Duracell.
How many you say?
Twenty! Motherfucker! Twenty!
Here ya are. Keep the change.
That's right on time. This is my friend, Vito. His pops is Sal.
WAKE UP!
Don't worry about it.
You're raggedy as a roach. You eat the holes out of donuts.
I'll be back on my feet. Soon enough.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
It's Miller time. Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
ML?
What?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
ML stands for ML. That's it.
Naw, that's some stupid shit. Now you know how I got that name.
Korea man is OK. Let's leave him alone.
Hey! What did I say?
Who doesn't work? Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie, what took you so long? I got a business to run.
Mookie! How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Depends.
Can you pay me now?
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight. We're still open.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Do we now?
Quit bullshitting.
How much? How much do I owe you?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
You only pay me two-fifty a week. I owe you fifty bucks.
Keep it.
You keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No. What are you gonna do?
I can dig it. It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Mookie?
Gotta go.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
OK. OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
I know I haven't seen you in four days. I'm a working man.
I work too, but I still make time.
Alright. Alright. I'll be over there sometime today.
When?
Before I get off work.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
What took you so long? Is it hot?
Hot. Hot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream? The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit! I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can run out and get it.
No! No! You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
It's cold.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda. Meda.
What?
Feels good.
Where are you going?
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.
Act like one then. Be a man.
Later.
Mookie, late again. How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
Shaddup, Vito.
Fuck dat shit. I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
What?
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Magic Johnson.
And not Larry Bird? Who's your favorite movie star?
It's e-vit-able.
Keep dreaming.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
Ya like him, huh?
That's what you think?
That's what I think.
I'll do that.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
Pino, no joke. C'mon, answer.
Whaddup. Money?
I was going to buy a slice.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
I understand.
I love you, my brother.
Get the broom.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Sez who?
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
I know this.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good. I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
How do you know this?
I know.
You really think so?
I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Hey! Watch it.
I didn't want to come to work anyway. I hate this freakin' place.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere. Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Pop, stop lying.
Vito! Pino! Let's go.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Both of youse--shaddup. This is a place of business.
Take it easy, Pop.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Hi.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Hey guys.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
HARRY!
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Excuse me?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What?
Okay.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
I don't follow.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
I know I am, Mom.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Mom, you know that never works.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep. HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
What?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
H A R R Y...
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Got any crazy eights?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Who's Captain Rob?
Just a guy I hang out with.
Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Peg leg?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Whoa. What was that?
What?
Your mom made a move on me.
She did not.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Will not.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me. Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Nice jugs.
You're it.
You're it.
Can he do that?
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
I don't know. Owwww.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Owww.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...
According to the map, we're just about at school.
What?
Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
That's a cow, Harry.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Shut up!
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
HARRY, can you hear me?
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Go away, assface.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A raft.
A blimp.
George Washington!
Who?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
You're it.
Am not.
Are, too.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Well, I'm listening now.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
What? What did we do?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
A float!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Ready Lloyd?
Wait, wait!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Guys, this is much better.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Right.
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
You take her.
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
That's gross.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Oh, you're good.
I thought I told you to get lost.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
That's not your tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
What?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
What are you doing?
I'm so close I can feel it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That's my boyfriend.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
Can you believe it?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Sure.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Okay.
Do we have a deal?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
How was that?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Will that be on the midterm?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Left here! Left!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I am strong!
I can turn on all the faucets in my house. Even the hose.
God, I've missed you.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
It's the big potato.
We start our own class?
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Times two.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
And...?
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
So what do you keep in there?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything?
Oh, just like the President.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
What papers?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Where is it?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Love it!
This is horse?
My Lord!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron. I...
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
What's that you're saying?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I can assure you...
Basically...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Is this what you seek?
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Paul!! Paul!!
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives. Let him stand free.
My Lord?
This is a Harkonnen animal. Let me, please, my Lord.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Death may be the result.... Are you sure?
You know the ancient tongues?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Do you know this my lady?
It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
Your Reverence.
What does she fear? What about my Father?
Remove her gag!
Where are we do you think?
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Is he....?
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Run!
Cinnamon... the spice! Do you smell it?
Yes...
What's happened?... Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always?
Always.
Liet?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
It burns.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Where?
Did they try and fail?
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
What can be done has been done.
... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Greetings. I am the Count.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Uh, beg to differ.
"Beg to differ?!" Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes. There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this! <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
No.
Eddie, where are we? We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No. I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula." In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Thank you.
Oh, there's my bus. Shit, where's my transfer?!
Don't you bave a car?
Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you!
Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
I am getting tired. I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Are you sure this is okay?
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
How 'bout a western? People love westerns.
Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be "Dracula."
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!
Ah! This is very exciting.
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
Goulash.
"It is my home."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?" Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Bela, don't worry. You're better than all this crap.
I never said I could ad-lib...
Goodbye! Goodbye!
So how'd we do?
Bela, are you ready?
Mmph? Where am I?
That's fine, Bela. We're still rolling. Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Eddie, you screwed up.
Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why are you here??
Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm so sorry.
Really? I don't feel so great.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Sorry...
Last night was quite a romp.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
I don't know. Where?
Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
I've never seen anything like him!
You mean a Tesla coil?
PLACES, EVERYONE! ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT! PRINT IT! LET'S MOVE ON!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Um, okay... roll camera
Rolling.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
I got the early edition! It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What happened?! Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
You don't understand! The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
This is kind of a stream--
Wow.
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah. The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
I don't understand.
Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico!
Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
Will he be okay?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Isn't he?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong? What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.
Sweetie, you won't believe it! I've got the most incredible news!
You got the job?!!
Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Better than not getting a job?
Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Who? Robert Taylor?!
No! A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Close! The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part.
It takes me comfortable.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you. Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Toss us out on our ass.
I'm no good.
Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I'm sorry! What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like <u>what</u>?!
Goddamn landlord.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
You're a fuckin' mess.
So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
I'm going to my mother's.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
That's Tony McCoy. He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really? How much money did he put up?
None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions. The mark of quality.
Dolores, wait!
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
For this one, we need $60,000.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
What other sixty-thousand?
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
That's not true --
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.
Really?! Well good for you.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics. It opens next week.
Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
Oh, "Dr. Acula." I get it. I don't like it.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood?!
Hruphh...?
Yeah...?
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Would that work?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for?? He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT. CUT!
"Perfect"? Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
I like to think so.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor!
Tor. Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent? Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like. When do movie shoot?
Really? Was the third act too intense?
No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Hey! You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
Excuse me, Sir...?
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.
Ain't that the truth! I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Can I help you?
Is there a script?
Tits.
Yeah. Crap with a star.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
Yeah! <u>Lugosi</u>!
OUR picture?
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Hello.
Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh. Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
What are you making?
Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am. How's your father?
He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's.
What do you mean?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh. Okay.
Stop!
What was that?
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Uh, atomic energy?
No. They're beyond that! They're smarter than the humans. What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Dynamite --
No, BIGGER! What's the biggest energy??
Those assholes.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!
Who's Dr. Tom?
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Let's get married.
Huh?!
<u>Right now</u>. Let's drive to Vegas!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand. Do you want my autograph?
I'm really sorry...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
Lines around the block.
I don't know.
Just like I always promised. Now you're among the immortals. You're movie stars.
Uh, yoo-hoo. Excuse me! Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor?
What octopus motor?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Too tall... too short... And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives!
This is our choir director. He's gonna play the young hero.
Are you IN5ANE? <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
I thought this was a group effort.
Mr. Wood? <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Why... yes.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose. It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
What the heck is THIS?!!
Please, be compassionate. I'm your husband!
Vampira! Hi, this is Ed Wood.
Who?
Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
You mean like a date? I thought you were a fag.
ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
Come on...
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.
How's your mother?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
You thought it was me?
I'm moving out.
Did you see that?
What?
You're nuts.
This is real, Bananahead!
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
What?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
What did you study?
Ed, can I see you a second.
Cool.
No, uh...
Yes, Ed.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Yeah?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
Yeah?!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Great line.
What if Shari's the dream?
Leave her be.
He's who we want to go with.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mr. Pekurny.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Who?
Al!
What?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
You said that.
You know who we are?
Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Hey, if it's free, it's me. You ready?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah. Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No! Don't -- Oh, wow.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby... Jessica!
Right.
So he killed himself.
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
No.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Hey, he cheated on her.
He made a mistake.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Yes.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.
He had girlfriends!
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
And what did he come back now for?
Eddie...
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
What's the matter?!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
What?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him? With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Hi, Mom.
Hi. Is Shari here?
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
She won't.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
What are you doing?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Cream rinse?
Dynamite.
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
You do though, you look great.
Ha!
Okay ...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Really?
Oh my God.
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
Go!
Really?
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh yeah.
That's lucky.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Why?
Um...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ... ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Page three of the Post.
There's a list.
Really?
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Okay.
I need to talk.
It's not their fault.
No... Could you?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
This is going right up your ass.
Kinda'.
What's up?
Where were you?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
You would do this? You would actually --
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Why do you do that?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I'm doing all right.
Screw off.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
I don't know.
All right.
Yeah?!
Polish acrobat.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
No. What happened?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
No, this is great. You'll love this. He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Ray --
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What's the dif --
Richie! She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Who is it?
Hi.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Please!
... Ray?
Yeah.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Good-bye, brother!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
No -- keep it.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Ed... I'm sorry.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
What...
Do you still have it?
That girl's an idiot.
Hi.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Oh!!
We have to stop meeting like this.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Can I help with anything?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Mm.
Good?
Ohhh...
Ed?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
That's the point -- this could change things.
What does that have to do with... ?
Sign here, please.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yo --
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay? I know what --
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't. You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Yeah, just --
How'd it go?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
What?
Dick... Dick,..
Having a problem with your eye there?
All right. Well, sure nice to meet you.
Fine. So do your count. Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay. Yeah. We know
Mr. M.?
Larry?
Yeah?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing?
I know.
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
Here they are.
Looks good to me.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
NO, that's fine
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
I guess you know why you're here
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Hello, Mr. M.
So what brings you here?
I'm looking at new cars.
Oh. New cars. I see. Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
So Tracy?
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
What a surprise.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Okay. But is this about the posters?
Possibly. Please just wait outside.
What is it. Tammy?
I'm the one. I did it. I tore down Paul's posters.
Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a word.
I did it.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday. Sunday.
And how did you get in the school?
Door was open.
Which door?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I don't believe you.
Could you get this? I can't
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Here?
More this way.
So what do you think? Should we get a room?
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life. He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
Hey Yeah?
Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.
Right now?
Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
What do you want, Jim?
You're there.
Yeah. I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that. You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake. Let's not make it worse.
A mistake? That was no mistake.
I know. I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Huh? Oh. Uh... pears
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Okay, let's say
And 290 "disregards," right?
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
You said I was a liar You're the liar, you're the --
Where 're you going?
I'm not like you.
Are you crazy?
What?
People can see this.
So?
These are private -- these are for us.
I know.
But other people can see them too.
I don't care.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We can't both run, can we? We're brother and sister. Can we?
She's doing this to get back at me
For what?
I mean at you.
For what?
We still have some extra ones, don't we? Maybe we can just --
It was Tammy I That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
What do you mean?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
No. Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Way to go, Tracy! Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah, you too, Tracy. I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Can I sign yours too?
Yes, Paul?
Have a great summer. And good luck at college.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah. So guess what happened. So Mr. McAllister, he -- Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
You dumbshit!
Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.
How's the left these days?
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan. I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
That's right. Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Look. I want to see you again.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
So you saved her.
I want to know about Exley.
He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
We talked.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
This business, Captain?
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Yeah, I hate them.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
They're yours. Take them.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Will you work for me?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
Give me one minute.
You know him?
Hey, partner. Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Stens? Was it Stens?
Maybe. I don't know.
That's him. That's him.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
Where are we going?
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
One in six. Where's the girl?
A naked guy with a gun? You expect anyone to believe that?
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice. That's what that fat fuck got. <u>Justice</u>.
Why?
Lynn.
The Nite Owl! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Dudley's guys.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Let's just kill them.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett. Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
You expecting problems?
He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken.
We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Ellis Loew.
What about him?
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
Richard Stensland.
I don't know him. Mr...
Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her?
Of course...
Thanks, but no thanks.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
No.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
I got her address.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Should I?
More.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Cotton balls. I found them just inside the meat locker door.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
What do you mean?
I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Clean?
More or less.
Anything?
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Where are the police academy files?
I don't have time. I have --
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Say what and so what.
I never truck with no sissies!
That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh? you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Nobody. At least not yet.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
But you were business associates?
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year. Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley. I am.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call. It's my case.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Yes, I do, sir.
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked. Stay with the Nite Owl.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
<u>No</u>.
Why not, lad? Absolute justice?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath. Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes. It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
No.
You're the key witness?
That's right.
I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
What?
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant. I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's that for?
Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's. I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea. You got a description?
The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?
Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.
Not good enough.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
I'm curious about you.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
How was I?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
Why not?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Okay. Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where will you go?
Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
When?
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
Okay! You're right! Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
A sweet man.
Under the house.
My daughter was a virgin!
Big V Jack Vincennes! May I have this dance?
Jack! It's Christmas!
<u>Hush-Hush</u>. Off the record and on the Q.T.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
No. But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Not a word.
You're back, boychick.
Sid, how are they hanging?
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What's he doing here, Sid?
Where'd you hear that?
Jackie! You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
What's wrong, Trash?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
I just called it.
No, Sergeant. I checked twice.
Have we met before?
Was it a party?
Something like that.
Fleaur-de-Lis. 'Whatever you desire.'
Yeah. Me and Patchett go way back.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.
Gee. The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap. Back in Narcotics.
Oh? Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
DePinto's dead.
Oh Jesus.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Yes.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Listen to me--
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
You've got it on tape?
Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
Why?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I don't know who he is.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
Who was that other guy?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Who are they?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
Wait.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Yeah.
What <u>is</u> that?
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that means.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
No shit.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if--
And you won't. Now move--
I'll pay you.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I intercepted phone calls.
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is. Did you find anything?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
No he won't.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if--
What if--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Reynolds.
No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Pretty fast.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
He came in four minutes ago.
Feeling lucky?
Baudmore Consultants.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Well then who can?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Oh my God.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With what?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Neil, thank you for your help.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight. Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
That's my point.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Why?
Yes?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Your stuff?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
A report?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
About what?
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
Did he give you anything?
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Hey.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Uh-oh.
Bobby!
Just for the criminals.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
You should take this seriously.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Something bad happened tonight.
What?
I saw a man die.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Bobby?
Yeah.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Have you been working with Rachel?
No.
Sorry.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Well, you know--
He's got his priorities?
Stacy?
How could you let me find out like this?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
Robert--
You <u>swore</u>!
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I see her for business.
It's not real... That's not me.
Oh, please--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Stacy, don't hang up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I know, but listen--
I know.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Yes.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
Does that hurt?
Well...yeah.
Good.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
You opened the thing?
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
Are you sure you're safe?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
It's really over?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Yeah. I wish you could've met...
Who?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
Sir?
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That ain't me.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Oh.
And then what?
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
Do you like fish?
When do I get to meet him?
DePinto?
Brill.
Never.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
Why would I--
He doesn't work that way.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You're not.
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
Eat your fish.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
You got a minute?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Who's doing this?
I gotta go.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
I can't.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I <u>did</u> care how.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
He didn't.
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
My shoe?
Seat 74.
What's his name?
Who would do that?
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
You're firing me.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Bobby--
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Mr. Dean--
Robert--
Where's Stacy?
She doesn't want to talk to you.
What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.
Why?
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Dad!
Do I know you?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
The blender?
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
Can I talk to you a second?
Table 122?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Jerry--
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
It's me, Robert Dean. From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
I need help.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
What does that have to do with you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
What is it you want?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
What's your opinion?
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
What?
I said fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What happened?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
Hiding something?
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
He's clever? He had help? Oh.
We believe?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
What about--
We don't know.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Yes?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes?
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
Now is that clear?
How much did you pay?
Hello! Good morning.
They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Excuse me?
You felt obliged to.
What do you mean, poetry?
What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
He said - be careful.
Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who?
Actually, you sing.
Pardon?
You sing. All the time.
I do not.
What's this?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
You should come into the shelter.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
What am I looking at?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
This is not very good, is it?
No.
Shall we be all right?
Yes. Absolutely.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
And the marriage - is that a fiction?
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Good.
You sew very badly.
When were you most happy?
Now.
When were you least happy?
Now.
What do you hate most?
A lie. What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
What? No!
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
No.
I can still taste you.
This is empty, just coming!
This is - what is this?
It's a folk song.
Arabic?
No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
Ouch! See - you're always beating me..!
Shall we be all right?
I'd better get back. Say goodbye here.
Why did you hold his collar?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Dance with me.
Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
It's so cold.
I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Don't leave me!
Shall we be all right?
Yes. Absolutely.
And a good read. Don't waste it.
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
Safe journey.
You too. Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Good morning!
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
Do you have your papers, sir?
What?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Her hands and feet were tied.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
May God make safety your companion.
How are you?
Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
David Caravaggio.
No.
Is this you?
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?
Don't cut me.
Or was it Toronto?
Go! Hey! Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Are you Hana?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where've you been?
Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
I don't know what that means.
Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
Well, then ask him his name!
Buon' giorno.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Hello.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Moose.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Irving Berlin.
For?
Top Hat.
Have a drink.
I've had a drink. Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton?
What did you say?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
You can't kill me. I died years ago.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm fine. I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
Right.
Aren't you?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you. What do you smell of?
What?
Apprentices.
Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh no, really. She has her book.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
To arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Candaules
Candaules you're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
I can already see.
No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
Why? Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Excuse me -
Your friend?
He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
Well then - yes. Of course.
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
I'll probably marry him.
Really? That's sudden.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Why? Is he staying?
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
I've been told that before.
Arguing about books.
You like him, don't you? Your voice changes.
I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Hey! -
I'm still here.
Why don't you go? You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Never heard of it.
I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
No!
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
I've met you before.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.
Why would anyone do this?
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
Kip - come and dance with me
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
Of course. When?
I mean home. India.
Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No. He's - no.
Hello.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
He's sleeping.
Only we have to go to work.
I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Does he have to go?
Pardon me?
Whoa - give me a chance!
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
You've got a mustache.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
What's happening? Am I needed?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Go away.
Yessir.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
This is wonderful!
Why? Are you German?
No.
This was your garden?
Or my wife's.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
Why didn't I think of that?
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where are you at least?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
I'm in the middle.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
He's on to something bigger.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
I have a question...
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
No you can't.
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please.
I don't want to waste your time.
Then don't.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Seems I am.
You disappeared.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
So what?
Do you mind?
You...you can't.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
For God's sake.
The Empress Death Mask.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
But Roki said--
You can't.
We going somewhere?
Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's a test.
How much am I paying?
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What the hell do I do now?
What the hell was that?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Lose something?
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
You're late.
And good morning.
Good morning.
I know it well.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I go in alone.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
That's because I wanted them to!
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
I'll need that.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
On what? Another job?
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I didn't mean to get personal.
So how long to pop the floor?
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
A dozen times.
Got it.
Charged?
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
Terrified. Still am.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Aren't we all.
He wasn't.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Camera in the--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
It's a party.
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You can't be too careful.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
Okay, you're a thief.
Yes. Yes.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
What?
Your share.
We're living history here.
I like banks. That's where the money is.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hmmm...44 long.
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
A parting gift from the Empire.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Charged.
Parachute.
Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Jesus God, it's going through.
Relax, don't jam it...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The disc is still in there.
The door's the only way out!
Jesus.
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
Put this on!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
--You're a cop.
You gave them the eight billion.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Gin, really.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
Which is--
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This is big enough.
Right.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Remind me why.
You two make quite a couple.
We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
You damn well thought wrong.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Yes it does.
See you.
Probably not.
Oh, hell. I'm dyslexic.
Where've you been?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Tony Marvin.
Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
His dry cleaners. You want him?
Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
What's she doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
All of 'em?
Seventeen thousand in debt. Whew. Is your ex-husband helping out?
Which one?
There's more than one?
So. You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
What? Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
So you say.
Meningitis? What the hell is meningitis?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
How does someone get meningitis?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Hi. Donna Irving?
Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
You're a lawyer?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Wow. Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
What's chromium?
An on-site monitoring well? That means --
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
It's a good day. I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Oh, my God.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?
I can put them in a good school.
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
Yup.
Open and shut? <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I'm sorry, Erin.
I never lied. I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
All I have is hundreds.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Where's Anna?
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
You're a girl.
Excuse me?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
What are you doing here?
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Course I did.
I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.
Okay. A 5% raise, and --
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
So you think we got 'em scared?
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
It's not about working hard --
Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Is that what I think it is?
You wanna talk about --
And that's what caused the contamination?
No shit.
Oh, they knew. They had to know.
I like this case.
You didn't care about my case?
Hey. I like working with you.
Jesus. They look like the Secret Service.
D'you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed --
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
I don't know. Big. Dark.
I was just asking. Are you all right?
Is that what you want?
Whoa. No shit.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Counts?
Why good?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Not in my world.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest.
Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money --
How dare you take that away from me.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
<u>I know</u>. We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
When? Where?
You're not gonna be there.
The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the doctor says --
This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come.
Why not?
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
You see your office?
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
Who's the judge?
Corey.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Right.
Did he say why?
Nope. And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
Ross.
Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
You come to the right place.
Pattee? That your middle name?
Nope. Maiden.
You're married.
What kind of chromium is it?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Yeah. A real moron.
It happens all the time.
What are you <u>doing</u>? Where's George?
I don't know.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
What's going on in there?
Some meeting. With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible.
Yeah.
Can I play roller hockey?
We'll see.
God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Erin. You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Whose number do you need?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You want my number?
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
You got more than one?
No.
C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.
Great. Another deadbeat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What're you doing?
Thanks for reminding me.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What are you doing here?
Great.
You are someone.
No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
That's Ed.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
What's going on? What are you doing?
Thinking.
About this.
I can't leave my job, George.
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
Thank you.
Hello?
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I'm embarrassed.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar.
Someone stole my stuff.
Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose. Here.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes. It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
I know. It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie?
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're moving away? When?
Next week.
Dr. Paulsen?
Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?
Who's Baxter?
It was .... the Emperor ....
The Emperor?
Yes, My Lord.
My lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
He'll learn.
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all depends.
The boy is our last hope.
I can't ...
You must survive, Luke.
Ben ... Ben ...
... Luke, you must not go.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate.
I can help them!
You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
And that is why I must go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls.
Well, it's been awhile.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I don't care. It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... the power?
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
Looking? Looking? You've found someone I'd say. Heh? Yes!
Yeah ...
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Give me that!
No, no! I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek, Yoda.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Because of my father, I guess.
Yes sir!
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.
Not likely! Where are the speeders?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes. That would be a great asset.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
That's right.
Wait. I'll send a patrol with you.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
Sit down, and shut up!
You, too, golden rod.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed. Goodbye, Mistress Leia. Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Han, we need you here.
We?
Yes.
Not you?
Me? I don't know what you mean.
And what are they, pray tell?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
An Imperial probe droid.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Hey! Someone's still in here.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Asteroids! Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
I take it back.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
There, there. Chewie get a reading on that. Looks pretty good.
What is it?
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Very funny. You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
That was no earthquake.
They're moving away.
Easy, your worship. Only trying to help.
Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Stop that.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
There's something out there!
Where?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
No lightspeed?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad. Then what?
Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas?
That depends. Where are we?
You keep logs? My, how organized.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian.
Can you trust him?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
What are you staring at?
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
He found him in a junk pile ...
No thanks.
I was worried about you.
... I love you. I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Thanks to you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Repairs ...
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I'll take what's mine now.
That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Thanks.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Very noble. Not smart, but noble.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
Luke!
What?
No argument, just do it. That's a command!
The deflector shields are gone.
I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about.
The speeders should be ready in the morning. They'll make the search easier.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
You rest now.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Closer?!
A tremor!
What??
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Artoo, you did it! I never doubted you for a second ...
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...
That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Leia!
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke?
This hyperdrive had better work.
Why not me?
I have followed my feelings.
I will not fail you. I'm not afraid.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I thought I was in good shape.
Okay. I'll give it a try.
I don't believe it.
Concentration. Heh? Concentration.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
That they are.
No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Four this time! The Force you feel.
What's in there?
Ben? Ben?
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Will they die?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you. You have learned more than I anticipated.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
I'll die first.
All too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Good God.
Excuse me. I didn't mean to disturb.... What am I saying?
They're...pretending to dress.
So am I. And I mean you no harm.
Do you have a name?
My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Believe what?
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
And we can watch ...
What, Lewis?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
No -- clothes. Stevie, they changed into them.
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
They look pretty docile.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
But he isn't us. He's your own kind.
I should. I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Humans?
May I say something personal?
Please
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture. I bet he's fake.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Ooww!
Where is he?
Give it to me.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
What?
It's so good to see you again.
Where's Plissken?
He's... near.
You're stalling, Eddie. Talk, you little gringo!
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I need a favor.
Wait a minute. I know that voice. You're Carjack Malone.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Dream on, blue eye.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Shut up, Plissken.
What's the little black box do?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
That's the deal.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Having second thoughts?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Defense against what?
So what does this thing do?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
No.
She's in the green.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
75% power.
Plissken...?
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Getting ready to invade.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation?
Does he know how to activate it?
Where'd they go?
Stop the damn car.
No way.
Where is it?
Where are they going?
Not yet.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Sure, Snake. No problem. You gonna kill me?
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Me too?
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
I got an idea, Snake. This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Looking to get out.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Who?
Are you crazy?
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
Don't follow me.
You need help.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
How do we get out of here?
Snake - what is it?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
All of us?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Is he coming?
I cannot--
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Yield. I have the advantage.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Arthur.
At last...
Merlin, will I live...? ...I was dreaming...
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
How? Where?
In the great book.
What?!
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere...
Excalibur! Is it true?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
But, I'm here.
Father...
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I left it in the tent, sir.
You freed it, son?
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Ye...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I'm going.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Who does it serve?
Because you and the land are one.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
No.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
There is one.
Who?!
You.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
The law forbids it.
There are things about love--
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I'm not jealous!
A lovestruck page!
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
They do.
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
Now you must pay me.
I?
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
What honey?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It's-
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hello?
Hi
Here.
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
What's this?
Dinner at the White House.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Where do you want this?
What is it?
Phonograph.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Would you like some more coffee?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
Rats?
But it's clean?
No. No rats.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Yes, I go now.
There is nothing.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Miss?
What!
A man to see you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Morning.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Why the math?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
And those lies she's been telling?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Never.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Convulsion?
So, what causes this?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why, I don't understand?
To begin with it could make things worse.
You could do it yourself...
Could you see her?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Like what?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Wanna drink.
Please.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
No
What's the difference?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What?
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Um........Stuff.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
Oh look at that.
You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
Where?
You've been playing with it?
Yeah.
You know how?
Wait a minute you need two.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
You really don't want me to play huh?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
He's nice.
Oh I bet he is.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Regan, why are you reading that?
Cause I like it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
Yeah
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
What?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
Why does God let us get tired?
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
All done.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Damien Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
So what's next?
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
Lieutenant?
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
Do you like films?
What's playing.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I'm not Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Where's Regan?
In here. With us.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
In time.
No now.
You speak Latin?
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
Who are you?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Uoy era ohw.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I'm all right.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Oh really, when?
Is that too tight?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
No momma.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
Shut up!!
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
I once did a paper on it
Really?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
It's possible. Possible however
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Is that a threat?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Who's in it?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

Twelve years.
Right, twelve years. Couple times a month.
So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Trunks?
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad. You could use some sun. Really.

They're falling out.

I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
No.
Piano.
Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.
Oh.
Knee. Tore it up against St. Anthony's. Right before the accident.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
How's the birthday girl?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Oh my God ...
Recognize these two characters?
Oh, look at you two. So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Out.
When they coming in?
What's the gig?
Tag 'em, Willie. The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday. Thanks.
Great. Terrific. Glad you could make it.
How we doing?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
That's not the point.
What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
Frank.
Jack.
Frank. I'm here. I always get here. Don't sweat it.
What's wrong with it?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Don't make trouble, all right?
I mean it, Jack. Behave.
Count it.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
So we on tomorrow night?
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't. They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Cindy.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
What d'ya got?,
Bosen black. Flat.
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really. You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone. In particular.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
Funny. Strike a bell?
It's only a ring. Not a collar.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?
Yeah?
It's me.
Frank?
Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family. It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Nice, huh?
What?
The trees. The flowers. Nice.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
A gust of wind killed him.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
That's what we agreed.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Jack.
Let's get it over with.
What are you, crazy?
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I'll drop the eighths.
Where the hell is she?
It's early.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
She'll get here.
Awe inspiring.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
You hit me.
All right, all right. I'm a little tense.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
No.
See anything?
How about these?
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Something, huh? All those bids.
Yeah. Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Hey, Frank.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
November. '71.
First night?
Day. Wednesday.
Last?
I thought we had separate rooms.
We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Okay.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Good idea.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm,flexible.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
Yeah. You mind?
Accommodate? I don't think I know what you mean.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Right. I love you, Frank.
What?
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
How's it coming?
Fine.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
No. Why?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You saw wrong.
Huh?
He's with the hotel. I called him.
What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He was wearing a suit.
He had to come quickly. It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
What're you doing down here?
Celebrating. Join me?
The Royal.
Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there?
Couple years.
February?
April.
Right. It's incredible how you do that. Remember things.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
You could've come.
I could've. But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
The tenth's out.
What?
I can't make the tenth.
What're you doing?
Just until we find another girl.
We're not getting paid then.
No.
Nothing. We get nothing.
I told you, Jack. It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What's it for?
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
You don't know?
It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one
We're on after Meadowlark. What's wrong?
Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Jack, you're on television.
What?
Fuck you.
Jack!
I didn't hear you come in.
Go ahead.
No.
Bought it on the way over. Clean as a nun.
I'll take the Mallory.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.
I mean, you can play. You're okay.
Charlie called.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Five years ago. November.
Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's. Sweet sixteen.
Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare.
She asked for it.
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
Thrilling. Both of you.
No, no. You boys are tired.
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick? How sick?
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Actually, that's my stage name.
I'm sorry?
Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
Blanche.
Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Candy Man.' Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in it sometimes. It's scary.
Yes, it is.
This where the auditions are?
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
This is show business?
Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
You're an hour and a half late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
We ran long.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
Terrific. Thirty-eight.
Susie. Susie Diamond.
Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner and dance.
Okay. I think that's all we need to know.
I sing now?
So?
When?
When we know.
Ready?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team. We work together.
Where's my name?
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.
Changed?
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That! You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Come on.
Hey!
Come on. We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
A seven.
My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
Nine.
Nine?
Nine!
What do you think?
Uh... good.
Shoes?
They're tight.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Don't worry. We'll take it out of your share.
Right.
The switch. Hit the switch.
Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I said I was sorry.
Give me that.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Baker's unabridged.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
Virgins.
Virgins?
He's right.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.
Great.
Great?
You're kidding me.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie. How 'bout it.
Huh?
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
What's with you guys?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Decency? Hey listen, pal ...
Some discussion.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Huh?
I can't sing it anymore.
What?
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune. But not with each other.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this.
I'll call you.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched onto. She a local?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
Funny hours.
Funny job.
Brought it.
Shit, thank God. You look like a creep.
Thanks.
No.
Don't worry about it.
Barker. Jock Barker?
Baker. Jack Baker.
Right. Bring him back.
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Yeah.
All right. Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it. What's he look like?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
No.
It went well tonight.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer.
For a while. She left.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
You miss him, don't you?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
You never sang before?
Where's egghead?
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
It's okay. Last one.
Can't sleep?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business. It was pleasure.
Relax. We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
How do you do it? Every night?
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Let's make a deal. You shut up.
You were good.
Nina?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
She's four feet tall. Ed?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
History.
Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
The both of them? In there?
He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Long story.
You're kidding.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Wow. But I still don't see how ...
Ma didn't want it around. After.
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi. Sorry.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Shit. I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah. Got my own sign.
So ... ?
We outgrew each other.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Huh?
Vegetables.
Tell egghead I said hi. If you see him.
Jack.
Hi.
Let me get the light.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.
Thanks. For letting me in last night.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah. The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
What are they?
The recent past.
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Ivory.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do? Grow a beard?
Why not?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
What's a prom?
How'd the show go?
Okay. How'd yours go?
From Hurley's?
Jack.
Yeah?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Sure.
John. It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Fine. You?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
Eddie.
Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
What did he do?
Fine work, Jon.
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
... Thanks.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
He's lying.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
My place.
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
Why would he need more?
He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.
Or reactivated the first one.
Pollux ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
A few blanks? Like what?
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried.
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
... I was dreaming ...
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Were you there to catch me?
No.
How come?
What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Is someone there?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
What do you mean?
You can't go. You can't be anywhere near that place.
Jon, what is it?
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
How's Loomis?
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...
Go on.
Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk.
Now what?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday. Your wife's gripe sheet.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
-- Castor?
Not anymore.
What -- what are you doing?
I don't know. How long before it kills us?
Give up, Castor. People are going to find out.
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
You'll what?
Pollux is -- what?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
SFPD? Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial. So take a hike.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want.
Clarissa left those here.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
You mean like ... condoms?
Oh -- Commander. I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You've got someone in your office.
Get rid of them.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
What?
I'm just having some fun.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...
Just following your example.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion. There's just one problem.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
As much as ever. Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital? Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor. Ha-ha.
What is with you tonight?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I'm not going anywhere.
-- what?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
... That's great.
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late. Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
I'll deal with her later.
Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
You? Married?
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
So you left her? Just like that?
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
No...
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Jack, are you okay?
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
No.
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Were almost done here...
Fightings a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Got it. Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Big Eds.
Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Were friends, arent we?
Im having kind of a bad day.
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Damn...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
Howd you know my name?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Wait a second... Jack...Jack...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Wheres my car?! Wheres my Ferrari!?
What the hell are you talking about? Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise itll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
No.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah? What do you need?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Miss me, Jack?
What?!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Figure it out. You got plenty of time.
Why not?
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Ive got kids, Im going home...
Ticket bad. You draw in lines with pencil.
What're you talkin' about?
What!? Look at the ticket...!
You leave now. Take ticket somewhere else. Next customer in line...!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Like the dress...?
Its lovely...
Finger food...?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...
No, I didnt...thats great.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
Here we are, mag wheels... Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack. Nice ride...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
All in one tape?
I have a bad feeling about this.
Dont go, Jack...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right. What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
I was in the city.
The city? New York City? Why?
Because thats where I live.
Party? Oh no, I cant go to a party...
What are you doing?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
Hello!
...my feet are hurtin...
Uh...that babys crying...
Jack. I said the kids are asleep...
Hey! I was watching that!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Wait a second. You want me, dont you?
Thanks, Jack...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
How can you do that?
$2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
No?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Really.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure. I really like Annie.
Good, Jack. Maybe well keep her.
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
Cmon.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
What...?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Not it...?
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Jack.
Maybe I should wait...
You really are incredible...
Jack...can we afford all this?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I need to tell you something.
Now Im worried...just say it. Whatever it is well deal with it.
Worse, you mean...
And now...?
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Good things...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Im out of the doghouse?
Youre so...beautiful...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Think bigger.
This place is a perk, Kate.
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Annie goes to a great school.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
Kate...
You look great.
I'm sorry...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Thats the one...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Mrs. Peterson.
Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
I just got a call from Terry Haight. Bob Thomas is nervous...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Peter Lassiter...
Do I know you?
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Can I help you?
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay?
Thats totally see through...
Merry Christmas...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
We got what we wanted. That's <u>enough</u>.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight <i>simulator</i>.
Five times.
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Where...where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey! That's a <u>prototype</u>!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
You're hot!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
Sis. Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
They're ready for you, sir.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh...good.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I <u>can't</u>.
What? What do you mean you --
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Are you kidding?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Why didn't you say something?
I can...make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
-- and why we need you.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Right, sir.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Yes?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Listen...the Heart.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
That's beside the point now. I don't see the sense of going on.
We must!
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
What is it? Anything wrong?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
He's making a fine recovery.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
A surgeon might...
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Doctor, what's wrong?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
We can't take a second more.
What can we do?
Yes...
I've done all I could with the laser.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
What's that?
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
You mean Inner Space is endless?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
How does it look, Doctor?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
You said there was a quick way out!
What about Dr. Michaels?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
A what?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Two in a row?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
May I?
What'd you do that for?
I'm married.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
What happened?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Come on -- it's no use!
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
How's it look?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
The Wall's transparent...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
What do you mean?
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
Certainly -
Can I see your license and registration please?
What's this, sir?
Wuddya do? Carl looks around.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't know. Few munce.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
No.
...Would it kill you to say something?
Unguent.
Huh? Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
...So I guess that's it, then. Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
We need more -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
...The heck d'ya mean?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
End a April.
Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, yah, I know that!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, now he's adorable.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Both of these.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
How ya doin'?
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
White Bear Lake?
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Mm.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Where you girls from?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
Yah, right -
Yah!
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Yah?

Yah, I see.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, but -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Sir? Right now?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay.
Jerry Lundegaard.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well... yah.

Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well, what do ya mean?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.
...Dad?
It's okay, Scotty.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8:30.

Okay.

A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?

I know it's a lot.
How ya doin', Wade?
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'?
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
You're darned tootin'!

...There's a million dollars here!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Carl somethin'?
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Where is everybody?
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
You look in his citation book?
Yah?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Gotta go?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge. I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven. I hope I dint wake you.
Yah.

Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah?
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, pretty good.
Geez! You look great!
Yah - easy there - you do too! I'm expecting, ya know.

...This is a nice place.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.

No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay...
You were such a super lady... and then I... I been so lonely...
Nope.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Nope.
Hello?
Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?
Margie Olmstead?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
...Hello?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
His wife?
Linda.
No.
So... they didn't...
No. No. They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Oh. Oh, my.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Oh. Geez.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
We've got a -
Whose car?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
...Chief Gunderson?
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
Yah?
Yah.
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
Was it reasonable?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
They announced it?
...So?
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
It's just the three cent.
It's terrific!
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Yah, I guess.
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
He's at Norstar.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
What... ?
He was killed in action.
No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.
You are a moron.
We're still men.
Cornelius! How are you?
Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No. I found something new.
Really, what's that?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man! Fucking great! Congratulations.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Have you finished those reports?
Is that your blood?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image.
No, I wasn't aware...
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
The dynamite...
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
Who do you think could've done this?
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
And I saw you practicing this...
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
A year? How'd you manage that?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
It becomes an addiction.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
This could go on for hours.
So you're staying in tonight?
What are you doing here?
What... ?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
I don't know ...
Please.
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
No, thanks.
Where? Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
Make sure.
Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
No... no problem.
I think everything's okay here.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
Whatever.
Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
You hear that?
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
What is this? Who did this?
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me... Leave me alone.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Yeah?
Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Say my name! What's my name!?
I'm sorry, I...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You are an insane person.
Marla...
I'm sorry, but I...
Tyler...
I'm not paying this back. I consider it "asshole tax."
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
Oh, yeah.
I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
... You know me?
Is this a test, sir?
Yes... it's a test.
You were in here last Thursday night.
Who do you think I am?
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Excuse me? "Throwers?"
I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tell the other person how you feel.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
No, supply oxygen?
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
The spork. I get it. You're very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
What?
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
I guess so.
And, now it's gone.
There's always that.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Insurance'll cover it.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't... think so.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Do what you like.
God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
I don't follow...
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
A nice, big cock.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Go ahead. Say it.
Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it? In the face?
Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
Anyone?
My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
Where's your car?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Hum.
What are you reading?
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway. You?
Any historical figure.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
You want to finish her off?
Huh?
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Look at your hand.
I... I think I understand. I think I get it...
It isn't... ?
We don't need him...
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah. Where you headed?
What... ?
Six months advance pay. Six months!
Fucking sweet.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Newcastle? Did you start that one?
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What should I have told you?
Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
You know what I mean.
What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to know --
What the hell ... ?!
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I don't know! Nothing!
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
... is over.
You're too young. Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
What's this all about, Tyler?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
What... ?
Is this really news to you?
What are you talking about... ?
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away!
Oh, yeah. I didn't really know my Dad...
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them? They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You... you can't be serious about this.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Yes...
Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
Fuck your struggle. I want out.
You want out?
Tyler...
What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
One minute.
Can't you call it off... ?
It's out of our hands. This is it.
Please...
What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.
Damn it! God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
NO...
Why... why... why... ?
Why what?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
... no, no, no...
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
What?
Who is this?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, this is Project Mayhem.
No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
What are you doing?!
Pleeeeeease!
Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
Thank you. Thank you, sir...
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.
How'd you know?
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I... I don't know...
Animals.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
What list?
The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.
You have to tell us now.
What about that?
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
What do you want me to do?
Speed up.
What did you see?
No! It can't be.
Should we knock?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Don't sweat it. It's over.
Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please. It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe. What's this about?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
You mean Alex Browning.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I'm not following you --
Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.
Stop it, don't move him!
Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
Kalarjian?
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay? You just face planted!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Welcome back. We did it. For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Kimberly? It's Dad.
You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
I mean it. Take care of it.
What feeling?
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
Mom?
Yeah?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
"It?"
This place?!
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Thirty-nine.
No.
Remember the departure time?
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car!
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I don't.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
You're the fuckin' devil.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Cuticle lacerations.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. And no... escapes.
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
It broke!
What are you doing?
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You guys are real... aren't you?
No.
Wow!
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really? How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Hell. This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Ever do this from a jet?
... to target at Ban Kia Na. We probe the site...
Gettin' old, huh?
No radio source. Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Yeah. Why not?
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.
You okay?
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party. Uh huh, right. Let's saddle up.
That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?
And a beat-to-shit AK? Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
You fucking crazy? I need it to burn these things off.
No cigarettes.
What's this stuff on the rice?
We'll check it out.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners.
How you doing, Brewer?
It's a guy in a cage.
American?
Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Roundeye.
Alright. Home run.
Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks.
That guy's not going to make it.
You never been in one of those things.
You better take off.
Are they going to torture us?
Yes.
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Spooks?
Intelligence work.
Nguyen. He twelve now. Not see him for eight years.
Where's Nguyen now? What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
Are you okay?
Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.
Why'd they want us?
Christ. How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
I do?
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand?
Yeah. Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I know. I go with you.
Yes you can.
What was that?
John. My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir. Can't do it.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.
Where?
Not yet.
Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Typical...
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay. Just came through.
Um... actually, no. It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
Christ almighty.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
What?
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
I know...
It's not over. You made one mistake.
Who're you?
American. Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Can you walk?
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Colonel.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit. The best I ever trained.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Five. I never wanted that stuff.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
But now it's free, right?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes! They'll be in soon.
I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Will it hurt?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Oh, no..I have to get home...
This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.
Most men are.
Yep! Right on it!
Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I'm sorry.
I was attacked.
<u>What</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I'm fine... really...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?! Lydia who!?
I was not with a woman last night. I was out with Parry.
The moron?
He's not a moron.
What? The curse'll be lifted? <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid. It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Well talk back. He won't bite you.
What do you think?
So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
My agent. I called my agent.
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
What?
"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
Well! What do you want me to do - applaud?
How have you been?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, I know the place. It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Where you comin' from?!
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where? Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Yes... I... I agree...
.....Me neither.
Fine. I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Now what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
How much?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
What girl? I didn't notice.
Oh, Lydia!
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're -- -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
A quest?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
The Little...
They work for Him.
Him...?
Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Here's another twenty. Will that do? I mean, what's it going to take!
That's O.K.
Can I take you to lunch?
But I gave it to you!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
He knows who you are! He's afraid! I can tell!
SAW WHO!!?
The Red Knight!
Parry...
Who?
It's such a great song.
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Are there any questions?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Holdin' my penis...
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
You advise us!
Are you all right?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
What a gyp.
It sounds exciting.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
How do you know him?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
There isn't any more to tell.
Don't say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
Excuse me...
You're married.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
You're not going to play it again.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You can sing the song.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Is it my turn again?
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'm not.
You just going to sit there?
Yes.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
I love it.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
No.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Sure...
It brings out my eyes...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Rayette.
What?
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No.
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
How far are you going to?
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
Alaska.
Hey, mack!
I didn't get it, did I?
Can I get you anything else?
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Am I on TV?
Tea.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
Now don't...
No, I'm not... I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.
Sorry.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Oh.
You know who it once belonged to?
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
Very nice.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That's Carl...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
What?
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Yeah... I guess so...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Well... I better let you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Tita, I've got to go...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
How long have you been staying here?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Like what?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Do you want some gingerbread?
What?
With applesauce?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You're leaving?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
Bye, now.
Hello...
I guess you fell in the water.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
Nothing.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Tomorrow, then.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Thank you.
Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
Wait...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
Catherine...
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I don't find your language that charming.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
That's what you said?
Is he?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Robert?
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No, I can't...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
What?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
No, it's okay.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
What kind of doggy is that?
It's a Borzoi.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
That's an old maid's tale.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
You better hold onto your tongue!
There's some good things on it, though.
Pardon me?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Look at me.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Victor.

Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?

I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?

Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah.
You looking for somebody?

A girl named Amanda.

Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Positive.
You sure?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.
Probably. One of the many.
What?
No.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Not really.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Unbelievable.
God I admire you.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You're kidding.
Would you like me to change anything?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
You mean her.
Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
Fletch.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
It was planted on me, sir.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
Not a prayer.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
So what do you figure?
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
I think Id rather have drugs.
Fletch...
Jesus.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
You gonna nail the chief?
You don't have a piece of the action?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
What?
You find the source?
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
That's it?
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Good evening.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Check.
Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Ten days ago?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Has he?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Then he has.
He sighs.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
I'm the Sufi.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
What?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
We can't talk about it here.
Why not?
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Who?
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I'm all ears.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Thanks.
You doing a story on this guy?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Did you say cops?
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Cute thing.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
No, thank you.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John who?
John Ultrarelamensky.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Preoccupied with what?
Why do you keep doing this?
Stay! I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
Alan's in Utah.
You are a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I really should change.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
It's amazing.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Who.
So?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What are you talking about?
What does all this mean?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
What's wrong, Gail?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I think you better sit down.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
What?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Who are you?
Where is she?
Moved out.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Fletch.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Uh, almost.
Two...
Irwin...
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know. Look!
You broke it? You know the source?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How gray?
I'd say charcoal.
Just give me a hint, all right?
More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What? Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Fletch, you want an apology?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
Yes?
You don't know the Underhills?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Don't say it. Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag. Charged me up the ass.
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks. I carry my own.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
I'll buy you a new one. I found her.
Zuzu Petals! Did she have it?
Have what?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Assistant. And don't call me Jazz.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz. After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
How'd you get this from her?
I wish I knew. You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.
I don't know, what was the case?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Yeah, let's bury her.
You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
I came to warn you...
Aha, just what I suspected!
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
Got those Vomit invites here...
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Thanks. You interested. It's festival seating, so...
How much?
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
It's red, Ford.
Hello?
You okay?
Let's get serious...
What? Jesus, tell me!
No. Who's Art Mooney?
Yeah, it's weird. Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends? You didn't tell me that.
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
I can't kill this kid's father...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv.
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Hoh graphic! I'm going to dream of ears for a year! Ugh!
So, Zuzu. Are you okay?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin.
Who cares? I got a case.
This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father.
You need it.
I'm sorry...
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
So, did you find my dad?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What are you running from?
Polo.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay? Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what? Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead? I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Oh, but I am. Dianetics, Ford. You should try it.
<u>I'm. The. Biggest. Sissy. In</u>. <u>The. Wide. World</u>.
The point?
Let me go out like a man.
Well, hello, Ford.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
It's 7:30. You really should get a watch.
Kill them. Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute. You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What about you? Can you stand a toss?
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
No - no.
How's everything?
Everything is everything.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
There's nothing around. Nobody's holding.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing. There's only some talk.
What?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Well try, okay?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --
Yeah?
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Allo... Salvatore...
Who's this --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It has to be by the end of this week.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Formidable! Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker. Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious. Our American friends.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
He is not wrong.
There'll be someone else.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There's nobody like that on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Where from?
Des Moines.
What's he do?
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another. He's in shipping.
Yeh? Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
This Charnier guy. He's in shipping?
Where's he from?
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle? Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
When ya go back on?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Havin' trouble? You're a dumb guinea.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody. You goin' sick?
Come on -- one drink. Whatta you say?
Drink this.
Who is that guy?
Policy man in Queens.
No, you?
Hunh-uh. Check the bread. He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Monica? Who's Monica?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Popeye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy. Open the door.
Why not?
What happened to you?
You got the warrant?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
What about Sal?
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Pass.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground. Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, man. Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
Oh, yeah. Damn. My watch is busted.
Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with me. This is what we do.
Frank. We gotta go back. Frank...
Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this.
Frank. Hey, man. You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
You alright?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Frank...what's wrong?
Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear. What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
Okay...
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Honey, what is it? Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know. He loves that thing.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
The future guy?
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it. Hey.
What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there?
I think you know, Frank.
No, I don't.
Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that.
About what?
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body of a murdered woman.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know. Sorry, Dad.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
Wait...
Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens. CQ 15.
Hello?
I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it?
Huh?
The World Series. You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What?
What the hell...
I'm dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream.
What's going on?
Oh my god.
What?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five? That would make it...
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What's that?
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay. I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop. It did.
When?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go. Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad...?
Chief?! Is that you?
We're doing all right, Dad. We're doing good.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know. Cause I still remember.
What, Johnny? What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What? Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What? What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died. It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
When?
October 22, 1969.
What kinda twisted animal.
Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I don't know... What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work. They'll just think you're crazy.
I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I'll be damned.
It's okay. This is working. This is gonna work.
Tell me something good, Chief. Tell me about the future.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him! Dad you got him!
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.
What are you doing here, Satch? You off today?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
Wait. Something's wrong. I don't...
What's wrong?
I'm not your uncle, kid. Gordo, what are you doing here?
Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull! What the hell!
C'mon, man. Get inside. I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
How you feeling?
John. John, you all right?
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Huh?
Gordo?
She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Another rough night, huh? That it?
She makes ten.
That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky break.
Our lucky break. Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Uh, huh.
Got a minute?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
So how'd you like LION KING?
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
You work too hard, John.
Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Wife around?
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
I look familiar?
The 2-3. Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Hell-
Sullivan?
You have the right to speak to an att --
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.
Where are you going?
Going? How do you mean?
That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
No more... I can't!
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
I don't know...
What're you doing?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.
How about a roll in the hay?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
Think you can figure it out?
That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.
What're you doin'?
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence? No, man!
I'm a slow eater.
It's dark down there.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
What's the matter?!
Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
Here. Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What's this?
Your bed.
A hammock?
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What?
Look what I found. Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
No. I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly! Where are you?!
It's deceiving.
And, what about us?
What happened that night?
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
You're Shelly?
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster! Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Is... is everything all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
Yes.
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it. I can tell.
I thought that was the end of the song.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Who's Horace?
What?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
That's it. Pull over. I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down? It's hard enough to read this thing.
Darren, we better turn around.
Why?
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right. Just drive toward him. He'll move. Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us.
Oh, jeez.
Don't worry about it. Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Is that all you found?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason. Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, you guys! The game's over!!
You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
My ass.
Never should've let her play.
Jason who?
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
What it is?
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Daddy, what is going on?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
You got it. Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan. Not this time.
Wait a minute. I just...
Lake Forest Green?
They did show up. Isn't that great?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
So what happened?
You mean you had a bad dream.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
I can't believe no one called back. I better...
But what if they try and scare us?
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort? I haven't seen him for hours.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
Will you listen, dammit!
Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I've seen it.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Well, let's hope not!
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
So let's talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
The what?
Steven...
I'm here.
Anything else?
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
No, I --
Twenty.
Look --
Thirty. Name your price. Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
What do you want?
You know what I want. You know why I need you.
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Ed...
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Everything'll work out. Trust me on that.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
You're talking about my lady.
That's very colorful, chief.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
She's beautiful.
Her name's Stephanie.
Does he know about what happened?
It was a community service.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, you dipshit! Take these off!
Sorry, I'm working now. You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
Yeah...
Well?
I'm sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
I'll be back later. You just be cool, okay.
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this. Just hang tight. Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
About what?
Look, I know I treated her bad --
No -- she left me! After her miscarriage, I --
-- Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she? Didn't she?!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Really?
He bought you that?
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
No thanks.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
That was truly excellent.
Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
What murders?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
Christ...where's Rennie??
What's that?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
This is Jason's fault!
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
What are you doing in here?
They're out of town.
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
What a beautiful day.
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You had me worried to death!
Can't we at least talk about it?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
So, are you having fun yet?
I can't swim.
It's not that simple.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
I've got the numbers.
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Where are they?
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
You are going where?
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Say it again.
Alla puttanesca.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
It's just a review.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
And he was there?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
That's awful.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
What was it like?
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
He carries a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
Where is it?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're making too much of this.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What?
Shoot him.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
What?
The Red Sox
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Opening night?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
First you tell me.
What else?
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Yes.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What else?
Your father said you might be here.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Opening night, Lillian.
That's always been my problem.
And you've been extremely patient.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Then say it.
Life is good.
I don't know.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Why do you care?
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
hat was this morning.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.
What do you mean?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Why?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes, Peter.
What color?
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Burnt sienna.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
There was a review.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
I haven't come to you.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Are you sure?
Oww!
Everyone takes his turn.
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Enough.
Just an admirer...
You'd be Gandhi -- ...I thought you'd be bigger.
That was lucky.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa... long time ago.
What'd he say?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
A -- a week.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
It was one incident.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
Hm. Is it?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
Are you going to walk all the way?
Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I would rather march.
We need your help!
In England, I was a poor student but I --
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
The fools! Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
You're an extraordinary man.
All right. Fine.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Have you read his magazine?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's over.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out. We have to go back!
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
How much extra?
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No? What's keeping you?
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Don't underestimate these imposters.
That's the last.
Something's not right.
He's not here. It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Get it. From outside, if you have to.
What are you waiting for?
Where do we start?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
How often do you test, Director?
Often.
We believe we have a suspect.
What a relief.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
Jerome--?
Good to see you're feeling better.
Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"?
It's about the Director.
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
You okay, Jerome?
What about this?
It needs work.
You had to be a right-hander.
You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it.
What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Call German.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
Where?
In a corridor.
Come on--we're taking off.
You really had other offers?
Is that all?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so. The stripe.
Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
How was your evening?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry. I've got plans.
Again?
She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
You may as well invite her here.
Hello?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
I have your samples ready.
Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
I hope he's not just a body.
Yeah.
You can wear lifts.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You worried about the cost?
Hugo! I've found him!
I've found him too.
Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
We were just looking.
Have they found our friend?
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You didn't know?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
I envy you, Jerome.
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Let's walk.
Who are they?
I can't.
Come on.
My medication. I left it back there.
What is it?
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
I've got enough here.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
I'm not doing it.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
The name? For the certificate.
You gotta be kidding.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Sure, You're working on the passports... ... and visas?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
Beynon.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
What about your wife?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
What do you add up to here?
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
Hi.
You okay?
You want to drive?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Feel good?
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Wait... give me a minute.
I'll be okay.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really?
How was it?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
You were asleep.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
$250,000 right off the top.
Is he straight?
Thanks again. I 'm glad you waited.
I couldn't have... much longer.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
You know how I feel?
Promise you won't laugh.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
What about the bank?
Doc...
They checked in.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Why?
He might be ready to chop us up.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth...
What do we do?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
He must have.
How long ago.
Fifteen minutes.
There better be a guy with the
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
You've got it all figured.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
There may be a hunting party.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him. Where do we go from here?
That would be the first time.
When are you going to learn?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
Okay?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We better stick here till tonight.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
I don't want to hear it.
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.
You and me.
Can we make it?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
So what?
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
That's right.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
No, I'm afraid not.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Can I help you?
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
All right. Shells?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Where?
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
What about the vault?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Wire pull over?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'm good at that.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Drive.
How was that?
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
That right?
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Can he trust you?
I got a nurse in mind.
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack, I don't know anything, Jack.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
How?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
What did you do? Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I know.
I made a mistake.
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it.
Why?
That's not good enough.
Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
That's nice.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Who paid you to see me off?
I can't Jack. How can I?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Where's he living these days?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
Everyhing go off all right?
Fine... I want to talk to you.
What about?
Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Really.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
It is. Honestly.
You know Sid Fletcher?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
I know him too.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Go on.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Really?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
No. I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Brumby.
Is he coming here?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Who set it up? Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Have another?
Look, look. Get your suit cleaned.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about your father.
Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
Why would it?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
You work here, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Nowt.
See you later.
Where you off to?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
How many?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Who's Brumby?
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Get knotted.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it?
I won't be using the room tonight.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Definitely.
Will this do?
Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Ta.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny. Can I phone London?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
I'll call the police.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
You sod.
They came back?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you awake?
No.
Do you want breakfast?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
No. Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
What's it to you anyway?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Still got a sense of humour?
Jack! I didn't like that.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eh? Have a drink.
Scotch, please.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
Not going, Jack?
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We've got to take you back to London.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
Ask me?
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that? A hundred?
That's right, Harry.
What's that?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
How about that, Jack? Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em. They, hey: it happens to us all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
I had to.
You had to, yeah. Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
You did?
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
You're on this...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not.
That's right?
Eh...?
...that's right...
Eh?
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Yes.
Yes, it is. And you know who's responsible?
He is?
He's doing very well.
I heard that they were running cold.
The nurses?
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well. He's doing very well.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
Starting up.
What?
Just the act.
That's right...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it! Men come...
...you're absolutely right.
They...
They have...
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
What do you mean?
Somebody...
Yes...?
Should do something to them.
Something. To pay them back. Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
How?
How? Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Someone should rob the office.
How many leads have we got?
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff? Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
Yes. I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
We're just speaking about it. As an idea.
As an idea.
Yes.
No.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?! No.
Well. Well...
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
You didn't?
No. Not actually.
Did you?
What did you say?
Yes. I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George? We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
That's right. It's a crime. It is a crime. It's also very safe.
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
Yes.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
A job with Graff.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
What?
What? What? The leads.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You...
I'm sorry?
Me?
Yes.
Dave.
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Oh, yes, George.
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
No.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
...they take me, then. They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Me?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory. Before the fact.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why? Why, because you only told me about it?
You went for it.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why? Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
I do?
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
Uh-huh.
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yeah. That's swell. Yes. You're right. How are you?
I'm fine. You mean the board? You mean the board...?
I can't close 'em.
Well, they're old. I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Yes.
Huh?
Yes. They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
It is dead.
It's a waste of time.
Yes. I'm no fucking good.
That's...
They stole...
What. What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
They stole the phones.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
...what am I going to do all month...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
To the cops?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's swell. Another waste of time.
A waste of time? Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
The cops?
Yes. The cops. No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Why? Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where were you?
Where was I?
Yes.
I was at home, where were you?
See...? Were you the guy who broke in?
Was I?
Yes.
No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah. You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Where did Moss...? I...
Will you excuse us please?
Did they...?
You understand?
Did the leads come in yet?
No.
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Read it. Bruce and Harriett Nyborg. What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
You...
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
I don't know, George, why?
What?
That they're going to be upset.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in. I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Mmm.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, sir...
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
Oh, fuck. Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK! WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!! OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Moss...Who told him?
Fuck insured. You owe me a car.
Please don't leave. I'm going to talk to you. What's your name?
Levene!
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma! I'm talking to you...
I've...look. Will someone get this guy off my back.
The people downtown said...
Mr. Levene...?
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
What about the other two?
What two?
Four. You had four leads. One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...no...
...then...
...I only...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that? What is that...?
Roma.
Under him?
Murray...
...you talk to Murray...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Yes. I am. I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Murray said...
John. John...
Either way. You're out.
I'm out.
Yes.
Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
Of what?
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
Alright.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board. You've got four...
Alright.
Now? Now?
No.
I'm asking you. As a favor to me? John. John: my daughter...
Why?
Because I say so.
You want something off the B list?
That's alright.
What happened?
Ah, fuck. Leads! Leads! Williamson! Send me out! Send me out!
The leads are coming.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What does that fucking mean?
Would you? Would you...? Or you're gonna what, fire me?
It's not impossible.
You are?
Yes, I am.
How do you know I made it up?
What?
How do you know I made it up?
What are you talking about?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Well, hadn't it?
No. It hadn't.
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Five thousand. I kept half.
Do I have to tell you? Moss.
It was his idea.
Was it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Uh-huh?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Only the beginning...
I've got the check...
The check's no good?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. I'm busy now...
Their check's no good? They're nuts...?
Call up the bank. I called them.
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this: I said...
Give me some leads. I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shit.
"'Why? Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..." Huh? Huh?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them. As I do, as anyone does..."
I got 'em in the kitchen. I'm eating her crumb cake.
Eight units?
That's right.
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the phones...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
From the store.
Oh, Christ.
What is it?
Glad to meet you.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek. Yes. In Florida?
Yes.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's... I can tell Jim what you do...?
Uh...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh! For the magazine...
Yes. Is this something that I can talk ab...
You're sure?
No, his wife is.
Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you have...?
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh! My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
What?
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Me.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Ricky, I...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Did I...?
Yes.
What do I...?
Yes.
Gimlet.
Well, let's have a couple more. My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I've got to talk to you.
Who did she call?
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Three days.
No, I don't know. Tell me.
To change our minds.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba...
Three business days. They mean three business days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I don't understand.
You don't count Saturday.
But I'm not counting it. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. So it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy. I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
What's going on here?
Tell me again. Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No. She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
No, no. That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
What does that mean?
...what, what, say it. Say it to me...
I...
What...?
I...
What...? Say the words.
I don't have the power. I said it.
What power?
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what? To negotiate what?
This.
What?
And the check is...
What are the police doing?
It's nothing.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?
Yeah. He closed a deal.
Eight units. Mountain View.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home. I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract. I filed it before I left.
They didn't get my contracts.
They didn't get the contracts.
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk. I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
It went down. I filed it.
You did?
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Where are you going?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what? With what, John, they took the leads...
If you don't want it, give it back.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three? I count two.
Yes.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
We had a slight burglary last night.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk. James Lingk. Your contract went out. Nothing to...
John...
Are you alright?
Yes.
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Did you see my present for you?
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know. How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator. We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
We have no money for a rug.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
Vitone! Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Yes, thank you.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Connie.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
Tom is right.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Honey! Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
No, Dad.
Now what is this talk about joining the army? Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
It's all right. He stays with me all the time.
Oh. Mikey, what's up? I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No. I mean, are you sure?
What's that?
The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
...Who?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
What is it? Can I help?
Fredo. Where are you going?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
We have time.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
He's an Italian?
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful. For me, there is only my wife!
I bet you can't guess what happened?
The 'patrone' is here.
Chi?
It's Michael's request...for your safety. We can send out for anything you need.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Within the compound will be fine.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
If you need anything, just...
But if you're wrong...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
They can come in now.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me? The baby?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
That plane goes to Miami...
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
What's up?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The room has a bug in it.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
You're right.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Do you gamble?
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through.
I'm going to the market.
Whose orders are these?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Kay.
How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Why don't you sit down?
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Who do you think you're talking to?
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
It's Michael. How are you, Mom?
I'm alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
You talk about the baby. She can have another baby.
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
Sit down, this is almost over. You follow the baseball games?
You're a considerate young man.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Terrible. I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
So?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
I just left our friend in Miami.
How is his health?
Not good.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
I know.
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.
I know.
Sure, Mike. I'll go along.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen. He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
We'll try.
And?
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
You want a war?
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
What's this?
How much more a month?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
What was that?
I accept your generosity...
What makes you say that?
Just thinking out loud.
Fuck you.
Not anymore you don't. Doll.
This looks corny.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
So what did you think?
You know what? I think you guys are all jealous.
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
What's that mean?
I wasn't going to try anything.
It never crossed your mind?
He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It still hurt. A lot.
You liked it too.
Sure. I loved it.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?
What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No. You are a guest now. You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough. Fifteen years.
You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.
Your wife?
I'm not married.
Why?
You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course. I am married still.
Yeah? What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
A homo?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks. Why do you do it?
What do I do?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it. This wasn't me.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
You must leave. You were not here this morning.
But I didn't do this!
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Good morning.
Mornin'.
My name is Whale. This is my house.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Just that I was in the Marines.
Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Or would you prefer a beer?
No. Iced tea's fine.
These are your paintings?
What? Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say. If you have to ask --
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What was wrong?
Huh?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken. How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough.
Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You don't say? Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Your family ate dripping?
I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free for lunch.
All right, I guess.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Did you now?
I liked it. We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
No.
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
Did you kill anyone?
Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No. I could have, though.
Can't today.
Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What way might that be?
So we understand each other?
Can I see what you did so far?
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry. Not today.
Oh dear. I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
Not at the moment.
Ah. A philosopher.
Do you miss it?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
You first.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back?
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not me.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
You're talking through your hat now.
Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.
You were a soldier?
You asked me to model. Remember?
My apologies. I had no business snapping at you.
No harm done.
I'm game. Sure.
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
If that's okay?
What did I tell you? Listen.
Who's that?
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
No. The girl.
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Let's get out of this funk hole
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
It's not like her.
Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
That only leaves the rest.
Do I have any other choice?
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
I never made it to Korea.
But you said --
My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
What happened?
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
Storm's getting worse.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
I don't remember that one.
I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.
But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you.
Barnett. Barnett on the wire.
So it is going to happen after all.
No. It won't do.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect? Bronze?
I don't know.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
All right. Let's take it off now.
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
I'm up. Thanks.
I liked it. You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We'll watch it.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Go home, Clay. We're closing up.
I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars --
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Thank you.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You only embarrass yourself.
Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean. Your reputation.
But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Yes. Perfectly.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
So what do I do?
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Jimmy. How are you?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please. You shouldn't stand on my account.
Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a few minutes.
Of course.
Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Which ones? I bring them all.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
One likes to live simply.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Sure.
So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?
Yes?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is Born"? I never guessed.
Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Can that count as one question?
Of course.
Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me everything.
Mr. Whale? Are you all right?
Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart?
I was going to take a swim.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
How are you?
Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
What are you doing here?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Jesus ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I do ... Christ, what happened to us ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
Yeah -- ?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
Get out --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, that certainly won't do.
What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
I know you --
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
Let them go --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You have my word...
I know you.
A little family emergency --
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
No...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
I know you.
Consider me gone, Detective --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
Who is it -- ?
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
The other day....
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...
Got it ...
Diane 1.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
It's all microchips and shit ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, man ...
You mean the poor --
Donny --
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --

For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

Most of 'em are late-model...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's a good one, Donny...
How are we supposed to--
Any word, Kip -- ?
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
No.
oh.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
You getting my checks ... ?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
What time of year?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I know...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Oh, for God's sake
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...

Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Yeah... You want a ride...
Sure -
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
No...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You okay -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
"About what?"
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
What happened to you?
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
"Shadow games?"
Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
You okay -- ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Nah.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Come here --
What?
Come here -
What?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...

You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

What's with the look?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
Mitch.
On account of Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey.
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
She's trouble --
I go with you --
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
No way ...
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
What the hell's that -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
I take out my slim-jim...
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...

With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
How is he -- ?
Where to -- ?
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
This time it's for real?
She does have one thing you don't.
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
Whatever do you mean?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
You think it can be done?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
How old are you now, Toby?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
So she flies -
What about me?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You know what you got here?
Not really --
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What do you want, shithead?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Billy, how are you?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great. He made mirrors.
No more shines, Billy.
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Wha? Me?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Nods again.
Anybody! You understand?
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Paulie. You're all I got. I need help.
I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week.
What're you doing? What about the car?
What do you do?
I'm in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?
My bag. My bag.
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Henry. Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Stop! Stop!
We've got to help each other.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Get packed. We're getting out of here.
I had everybody working. Even our old babysitter.
She's beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Who's gonna do that?
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
For Christmas. Your share. It's just a taste.
Jimmy.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
Watch this.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
Nah.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Yeah.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
He heard.
What happened to you?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Where'd you find such creeps?
You ready?
Yeah.
You know what to do?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk. He's been locked up for six years.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy. Come on. Relax.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
I got dry cleaning.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
I don't want them left back.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
But, Paulie, please.
You want a partner?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Yeah.
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
All right, then.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Stop brushin' me back!
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
What are we gonna do up there?
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Why not?
How's the woman?
Gone.
What?
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
Okay.
What class?
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Okay.
Is that true?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Did she get my Double Burger?
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Chuck, let's go.
What's up guys?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
I'm not sure--
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Retainer...
I don't think I...Larry?
I have about seventy-three...
What class did you say that was?
History.
How'd you like that course?
Good, it was all right.
Codebreaking.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Seven.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
Down there. And I'm nervous.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, there's a limit.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
Hey fuck you.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Fuck do you want?
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
What're those?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That's right.
Of course.
Okay. How?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
I think so.
What's that?
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
Shall we start the, uh...
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Get out, Will.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
No.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right. Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
Will.
Hey, how you doin'?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Thank you.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
It's Saturday.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Uh-oh.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Yeah, cured polio.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I've been busy.
You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Yeah.
Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Would you excuse us?
Tom.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Not at all.
You're here quite a bit, then.
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
I think so.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
He married his cousin.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
I do.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Now wait a minute--
--And confuse him--
Hold on!
He won't be a failure!
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
Sean...
So I hear you're taking some time.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Where're you going?
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
What should I do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could go for a Whopper.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened? You got fired, huh?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Like what, Will?
I go places, I interact.
What places?
I might understand that.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
That's very presumptuous.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Have you read all these books, Will?
Probably not.
Yeah, I read those.
I did.
That must have taken you a long time.
You think so?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
Nautilus?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
What is?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
No.
Why thank you.
You've never been out of Boston.
You've never been on a plane.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
How'd it go?
Fine.
Well, are you going out again?
I don't know.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Yeah.
Where were you?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
I don't know.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
What did you think?
Do you think you're alone?
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't ask for this.
What?
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
You want to read it?
No. Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Yes.
Gotta go with the belt there...
I used to go with the wrench.
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done?
I just want you to know, Sean...
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
You suck.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Five minutes.
Yeah?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine. Want to see my magic trick?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
I really don't 'date' that much.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
Yes you were.
Oh, you will?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Free?
You grew up around here?
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I have twelve big brothers.
Not a chance.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
Your house must have been a zoo.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Do you know all their names?
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Well...
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
Where have you been?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Promise?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I'm supposed to understand this.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
No.
Why do we always stay here?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
When?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
How's it goin'?
Fine.
Want me to take a look?
No.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Clearly.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Will? Are you awake?
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
I can't go out to California.
Why not?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
I'm not honest?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Yeah.
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ready, Pa?
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Ready, Ma?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You're *ticklin' me!*
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Naw. They paroled me.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
Gallon or two?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
What'd he look like again?
Short fella. Pale face.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
I didn't see nothin'.
Kinda pie y'got?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
So long.
Want to work?
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Deputy sheriffs.
Got a warrant?
Joad. Tom Joad.
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
You got dances too?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare! I baptized you, son.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Been out travelin' around?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Is it fur?
They're all gone--or dead.
They never wrote you nothing?
This is Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
She's settlin'.
Think she'll hold?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
What's the matter?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Thought you was in jail.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Women is always tar'd.
But we can still do it, honey.
They shore don't waste no time! Take her out.
Save your strength, lady. Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Want to work, do you?
Sure do.
Pull up behind that car. Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
How about a lift, mister?
Goin' far?
Been doin' a job?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Naw--not much!
You ain't got to get sore.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Yeah.
I never asked you!
You people got a lotta nerve.
What you mean?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
This here's a strike.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?

I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Yes, ma'am.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
What's the matter, Grampa?
How 'bout Granma?
Where you going?

How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Where you think you're going?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You take this. I ain't hungry.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
We gonna live here?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
No'm.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Pa! Shh!
That!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Mad, Ma?
Sometimes they do.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
How about it, Ma?
Don't taste bad.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Ma, you sick?
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
Thank God! An' we're still together-- most of us.
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
When?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
You promised, Tommy.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Got any more, Ma?
I ain't full.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
How's it feel, Tommy?
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
Looks like you done it.
They killed Casy first.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know what--this fella looks like?
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
What is it?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Sure. Good-by.
Yeah?
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Which ones?
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Tommy?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
Are you crazy?
Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
Well?
Listen! That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
You mean get off my own land?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now. She's due about three-four months.
Here we go!
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what about this?
Heh'o Tom. This is Connie, my husband.
If this don't beat all! Well, I see you been busy already!
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Man bones?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Whatsa matter?
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Please don't.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
What's this?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Morning.
Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You do not.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--Stop it--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
--No.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Wonderful.
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Remember high school?
Bob...
What?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Insane.
Jesus...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Where have I been?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Are you going to the reunion?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
It's always the little things.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Well, there's not much to tell.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
Hello...?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Yes.
Not the other way around...?
No.
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
You don't understand...
You went to school with these people.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
I just know.
You know where I live?
Yes.
What stuff?
What else? Say more.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
How was your day, today, sir?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Do you like the people you work with?
You understand the psychology of the job.
No.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No harm no foul.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Lisbon?
Well?
That's strictly B ader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Did you see Blank in there?
No...
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Throw that away.
This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
All of it?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
They're not happy, sir.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Enough?
Never enough.
I have scruples. Next.
Don't forget your identity.
This is not good.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
You have.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Yeah...
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Paul?
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
He sells BMW's?
He sold me this bad boy.
He gave me a great deal.
What the hell happened to you?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
It didn't work out.
That's too bad.
I have to get my head back into my work.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Why not?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
This is Annie MacLean.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Doesn't matter.
You okay?
What?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You sleeping all right in that house?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Need a lift?
Poor thing.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Thanks.
Feel good?
Yeah.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
How long did you live here with your wife?
Five years. My son was born here.
Why didn't it work out?
It is. It's lovely.
Just make yourself comfortable.
I am comfortable.
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.
Annie!
I don't care! We'd be together.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
The point was to love each other.
Why don't you go lie down?
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Oh, honey... What happened?
Fine!
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
No, you didn't.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Mom?
Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
Would you like to see that?
I don't care.
How long is this going to go on?
Did he tell you that?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
That's not true!
You buckled up? You cold?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did you ask him to come visit?
You already did.
Did he mention it?
You got everything you need?
Why? There's no food in the house?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
Nothing.
Grace? Is everything all right? Can we talk?
About what?
Well... So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
What are you talking about?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
What did you say?
Started what?
My period.
When? Tonight?
Who's going to want me now?
What?... Oh baby...
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Let's bring your bags inside.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Great!
David?
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
It's me.
Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
That bag's almost empty.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
No, let me go.
We're very lucky.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Yeah.
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
You've already made arrangements!?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
What if she doesn't want to go?
She will if you think she should.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Everything all right.
Huh-huh. You?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You're allergic to hay.
How are you feeling about work?
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
I have so much to tell you.
You want to take a walk with me?
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Sure. Does your daughter want to come inside?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
I'll help you with the coffee.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
I'd love to go there one time...
They fired you?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Promise?
Good luck to you, Annie.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Of course not.
Mixed salad.
What?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Diane!
I don't believe they'll expect that.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Don't you go to school?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I wouldn't let happen.
Yeah?
She gonna be long?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
Isn't it like, obvious?
That's not a question, is it?
Can you drive?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't...
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
It's warmer than I thought.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I thought your mom's coming up?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
No, not yet.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
You want to watch some television?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
IT WAS MY TURN!
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
We still have a way to go.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Hey, darlin'.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
What are you looking at, young man?
How long were you married?
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Well, that'll happen.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Now that's cool.
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
Secret Service!
How's it going, Ray?
Welcome to our show!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
What's that?
What's that?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Shit!
Shh!
Right.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
That's far out!
Ta-da!
Snoop onto them...
Damn!
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
It was him, man!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
I want it to have my children!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
One-handed!
Cereal.
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Who's that?
Curtis.
And what's he do?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Dead.
Dead?
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Mm-hmm.
Up all night again, huh?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Blow me.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Yo, showtime, showtime!
That's Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
How did you know that?
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What's this one eat?
Two days.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
Here's your class.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
What?
I'm Crash Override.
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Your slave?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
We need your help.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
I know, I know who wrote it.
You what?
Why did he come to you?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
How?
Shit!!
Alright, so what have we got?
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Ready?
Yeah.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
What?
Oh, wow, she's great.
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Excuse me.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Homicidal?
Gill.
Hello?
We caught 'em.
Good.
You're welcome.
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Colonel who?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Mr. Belford?
My name is the Plague.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Never fear. I is here.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Die, dickweeds!
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Joey, Joey...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Any questions?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
A hacker planted the virus.
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Murphy kid turn you down?
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
So?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Send a Flu-shot.
Thank you.
Hello, operator services.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
What number please?
555-4202.
Just one moment.
Purpose of visit?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.
Yeah. Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
We need to talk.
Okay sure. What about?
What?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
Don't get angry.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So?
I don't know Brady.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Not without Jamie.
You think she stands a chance?
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
What does that mean?
Brady!
Get back!
Brady!
Shit!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
An accident?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Mom, please
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
You guys always look great.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
About what?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Why shouldn't I?
How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
Ready to go. Who signs for him?
I do.
Outside.
Watch it.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Who you calling?
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What the hell did this?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
Sure it does.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your lucky. I wish she could do the same for me.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Double scoops?
Hi.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
It was the nightmare man
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Come on Rachel!
Coming.
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
Had enough?
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Jamie!
Rachel come on.
No.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
I can't.
Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
You don't believe that do you?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Dad, what's going on?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi Rachel.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You knew. You just didn't care.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
I don't know.
Call me.
Hell of a night.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Do you?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
This is 132, over.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
You got your riot gun?
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Get the outside shutters.
What are we doing?
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
When he makes that call.
Something?
He's been here.
This is starting to spook me.
Is that him? Is that him?
Oh Christ. Doc...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Where's that Deputy?
It's over.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Car trouble?
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Now you understand?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Shit!
I have a place for that.
Look.
Look where?
I don't see anything.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
He was standing right here.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Hello?
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Sure, see you later.
You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
What's the pumpkin for?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
Wait a minute here...
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Get him out of here!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
You locked yourself in.
I'm scared.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't know.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
I don't want to.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yes.
I wonder where they went.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Just answer the damn phone.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
My parents won't be back till ten.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Ten minutes.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Jesus!
You all right?
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I found the car! He's here!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
TOTALLY!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
I don't like that story.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
I promise.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
Laurie, you come with us...
I'm scared!
Hello.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Yes, she is.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
Thorazin.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
What did he say?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
Oh, good...
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.
Mmm?
I love that. That's my type.
We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi.
I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
Wha-- What kind of things do you build?
Are you really interested?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
And then, uh, April...huh?
I know. It's terrible!
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though. It really is.
Yeah.
That's disgusting!
...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.
Well, wait. You know what? I know.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
You're joking.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Right.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.
Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Really? Is the food that bad?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
Yeah.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Yes.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
Now I ca-can't remember.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
When did you first notice this?
And it's just in one ear?
Like what?
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid. What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal. We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Well, are...are they big?
Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
You-- Standards and Practices?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
Read the papers! Half the country's doing it!
Yes, but you name names.
We--
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Oh. Well, I live--
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Oh, God.
Yes?
Yeah, you would.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Isn't this great? They have everything here.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I...
You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
No! No...
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes.
Yeah. How are you?
I'm...all right.
e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, sure.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, yeah.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Yeah.
Isn't that beautiful?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Elliot! Don't!
Oh!
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But not over me?
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
I can't say anything!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I thought you weren't coming.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
You've been very cold to me tonight.
No.
Is something wrong?
Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
I know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
You bet.
It's so late.
Are you in a bad mood?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you angry with me?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost.
...this is a toast! This is a toast.
Get his wine away.
Hi. How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I want ice! Who's got some-- Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Why should I be afraid?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
Of what? I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Want some coffee or tea?
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm...
Hmm?
Mm-hm.
Because he likes you.
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
What's the problem?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I can't take this anymore.
Like what?
Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
Why?
Because I have to!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
You've been with someone!
Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
Who is it?
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
But who? Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Look at this guy.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
Hello?
But not you.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
Like what?! What?
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah. What?
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Yes, please.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Yes!
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Why?
So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
How are you?
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
Really?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--? You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Oh, now--
Yeah?
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hi! Hi!
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Everything's good. Everything's fine.
Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
He's fine.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think so.
I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
Yeah.
Ohh!
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I know, I know.
...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person...
That's really nice!
...you know? I, uh...
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Oh!
Go right over there.
Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!
Wow!
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean--
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself?
I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you talking about?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger? With a--
Hey!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, okay.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
True.
What? You're kidding!
Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Holly, please. Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know. H-how much do you need?
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Ohh?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!
Oh, Hannah!
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Here. Be careful with those.
Ouch!
Well, how about this?
He's married...
Sometimes she's terrific...
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
You know.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Hey, hi!
Awwww...
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, gosh.
You treat me like a loser.
How?
Uh, losers! All losers!
You're crazy! That's not true.
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
What's the matter?
Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Hey, what's the matter?
My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, so loosely.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't...
Can we, can we go?
No!
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Yeah. Me, too.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Right. Yeah. I had a...
God!
I remember you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
We didn't hit it off.
Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, really. You do. You do.
Yeah?
It was a terrible evening.
I'd never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
People change...you know.
Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.
So how are you?
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much. You know...
Well...
...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Have you?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
Nobody ever said it.
No, the reason I ask is--
You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, I haven't.
I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're kidding me.
Oh. Oh.
You're okay, though, huh?
I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Hmm.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Really?
Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know...
Right.
...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous.
Oh!
Oh, God!
I am. You-you made my day.
Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous.
It's all right.
Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband.
Hi.
Hi. How you doin'?
Okay.
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Tch.
Mickey?
Mmm, what?
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Yeah.
Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
Dad...
Oh...
Hi.
Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning?
Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Take our literature...
Uh-huh.
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay. Thank you very much.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...I was <u>working</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Yes? My <u>promotion</u>...?
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience.
Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...?
Well. Word gets around.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Yes?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
...why?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..." Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
We could skip the Gavotte.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes. He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Bad beat today.
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You're ready now.
I'm not.
Then you tell me, then.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I feel... I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
And who is "they?"
...they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're...
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Hard up as you are, at your age? Whadda <u>you</u> care? Surrender.
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
I know her by the Back.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
How was America?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
They got that kind of money?
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK? WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we Seen it Before.
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...sir...?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
He escaped...
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
No. And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes. You know I will. That's right.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am. It's just something he does.
I won't take much of his time.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction. To his appearance.
What reaction?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Oh, yes, what? You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I can make you rich.
..suitcase...locker...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
Why?
For a consideration.
Sir:
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own. I was told...
Starling...?
...what's he got against you?
Look at this:
...what'm I looking at...?
A fellow with five fingers.
Am I on that case, sir...?
No.
Yes sir, I saw it.
I am all attention.
I know you did what you could.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Said what?
Waal...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...
Waited too long, hon...?
I said how's your baby...?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
Give it up, Evelda.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.
My husband brought it to me from America.
A wonderful country...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...how so?
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Of course, Commendatore...
Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
...yes.
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
If your duty requires it.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?--
...your <u>scar</u>..?
My scar is a war-wound.
How so?
And? Then?
I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.
Darling, Dr. Fell. My wife Madame Pazzi.
Darling...
Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a pleasure.
...long overdue.
Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I owe...?
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
Where do you live?
She my foster.
She's not the first foster that you've had. <u>Is</u> she?
No.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
Is it necessary to know?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long. They die.
And you let her get away.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...spend some time on the streets. Ask me then...
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...may be the heat....
Can you walk? Are your legs working...?
You look lovely.
Thank you. No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...I'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...? Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Thank you, Cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
The girl could use some help.
You're <u>free</u>...
...when I...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Look what they put her on...
You should get Married.
That's what I should do. Tell me why?
Yeah, well, they solved that: turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No. I want to buy a dog.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
What was it. What was it, honey?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what...?
No.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself?
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Fine, thank you, but
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
We are here on sufferance. I am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...my love...
No. Invite us? No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
Hello....?
...what did you want?
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
An Honor. Carlo Pazzi....
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Thank you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
<u>Do</u> you. What does that mean?
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...but: this particular statue...
What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...a Dr. Fell. A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Brazilian.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
She must be something special After Dark.
Tell me why...?
....that's right.
..and <u>humiliation</u>? What is this new job they've...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then what brings you back?
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her. To appeal to her, and you feel that...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
Your father. It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
What's wrong with approval? You admired that man.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
I..
...yes...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
...why?
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot. On his rounds. And... and...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
And. I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
When?
My encounter.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Now what? What did I do this time?
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Eavesdropping, eh? Hear anything good?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Man, she's losing it...
Talia, don't go!
Wha-at? What is it?
I hope so...
Freeze! You're busted!
Mine!
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight, Jasper.
You and Wichita go to school together, right? Have you two ever...
That would be a No.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
What are you doing?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I just never thought of you in that...
What in the hell did you do that for?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Hey.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yes you do.
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Fuck off.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
What do you want me to say?
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
It's not my style, okay?
So, are you a cheerleader?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Oh, I have to hear this.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Because you're an idiot.
All right.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Things are going to change, Earl.
I'll think about it.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
I was talking with someone!
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You stupid cunt!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
What are you doing here?!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
What are you doing?
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
S'okay....
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Good plan.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Chick-en.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
And your worst enemy.
Like a suicide thing?
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Mute!
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Do you take German?
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Perrier water!
Did you miss him completely?
Kurt doesn't look too good.
We killed them, didn't we?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You can be so immature!
It's over, J.D. Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
If you'll excuse me......
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
I thought I...you..
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Answer him dick!
We on tonight man?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I think so, man.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
I guess.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
How was the funeral?
Everyone take their places on the stage! Isn't this thrilling?!
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
But my name's not...
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
What's that?
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Come on through.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Look who I've found!
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Bye.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Hello!
He's the manager!
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
Come on, sit up.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
sighs.
Can I go now?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
My name is Gina!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm so happy to see you!
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Fruit.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
It doesn't matter.
I think I'm dying . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
Him.
This.
That.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
What?
It's so beautiful!
I shall call him Diello.
You're such an incredible woman.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Poor Father . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.
I'm coming with you.
Yes . . .
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Bye, Dad.
Isn't it beautiful!
Are you a dream too?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Of course, yes.
The way you just looked at me...
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Sure plenty of times.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Must be nice.
What?
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
Hello I'm Dr...
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Zero's a number right?
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
That was cold...
Good boy. Where's is it?
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Uh... eighty two?
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Oh my God. It's coming out.
What?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
What?
Never to put you in my will.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really, why's that?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Where's my wife?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Thanks.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
I don't work here.
Hey buddy!
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
What do you want?!
Do you know where you are?
Ambulance.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Poor Trevor.
Dreams?
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
-Tawny.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
One leg! Like the Red Cross or something?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere! I gotta talk to you, buddy.
LaPlante!
Talk from there. You can talk from there.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
The bathroom! For two days?
Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie. Call me Bernie.
Looking... good, partner. Hang in there.
What's going on? "Guilty"! What is this?
I got your bail continued.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope. You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.
I understand. How often do you see your son?
Often, uh.
How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.
It's November.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick? Spanish kinda guys.
Spanish kinda guys!
You gotta kid? How old's your kid?
Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You mean like Bubber? The hero?
The thing is, Chick. I'm goin' down.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
THAT'S IT! YOU TALKED! YOU'RE FIRED! OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE!
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend. The fireman?
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
You!
Turn that thing off.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Oh yeah? A hero, huh? Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
"The Nomm"? What's that?
It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter.
Were you in it? In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Here. Get off here.
Yeah, my dad's great. He took me to the zoo.
Uh, er... I...
All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Yes.
I... I know that, John...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
No, I don't have the right. You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Vietnam!
You were... very... inspiring.
A script! I thought we just walked through everything...
That's not what I mean...
There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can support me anytime, John.
Gale...
I just remembered. You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
John, I know all about it.
What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
We're gonna wait here? The guy could be hours.
Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What's the matter?
What is it?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Unprofessional.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
How'd it go?
He's right. It's unprofessional.
Ticket! What's going on?
She's flying to New York. She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Upset! What's he upset about?
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
What?
He lost a shoe!
Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
You were in bed. Weren't you?
My God! It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God! Bernie!
Hi, Chief. You like the suicide?
Never reach out!
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous?
He's pretty... remarkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
What about?
I didn't ask him.
How are they with kids?
They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding.
So, <u>Neil</u>. How's it goin'?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
So where are all your toys?
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet. Here's the TV.
Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And the rent is okay?
-- hospital.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
As long as you keep remembering why.
That would be stupid.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I should.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Right.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Sure.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Everything breaks at once.
Isn't that always the way?
I apologize for that scene with my husband. You must have overheard.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
I bet. Going into people's homes.
Do you have a family?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
What happened?
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
About what?
About us.
I found a cent!
Hey. Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Baby, what is it?
I'm thirsty.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man scared me.
A man? Was it a dream?
Uh huh.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Did Daddy tease you?
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Mommy!
So you don't have anything concrete?
No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Has anyone seen Rudolf? I don't think he came in last night.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Thank God.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
Neil -- what --
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end? Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
We're going to think about it.
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
<u>Now</u>, Neil. Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
What?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
How was lunch?
Huh?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Do you remember who gave us this?
No.
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>? I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
The cab's waiting!
Did the cleaning woman come?
He wants to see me!
Philip! The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
What -- what are you doing?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Honey? How did it go? You didn't call me.
He wasn't there.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
That's not the case.
Who was that?
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Just reduced.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Oh, space! -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Okay! We have TV! We can all get stupid again!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Neil, do you mind?
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
Hiya, sport. Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
You knew a second ago. <u>Who</u> started it?
Do you see a man?
No.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Oh yeah? Where's the bed?
Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.
Even better.
Promise?
I'd like that.
Would you?
Really?
What the hell. What is this? A joke?
No joke, Lieutenant.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Lieutenant?
What do you think?
They appear to be authentic.
You didn't see this. Understand?
Did you find a sword? An old sword?
That's not all, Lieutenant. Wait until you see the tape. It's unbelievable.
Tough.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
This ties in with Nash.
We don't have any proof of that.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was England.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
What?
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
A few days ago.
Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you. I took a walk.
Tell me again. Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No. I don't scare easy.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Around.
She was a good woman.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash. That's a promise.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Yes -- I think it is.
I know that weapon. It belonged to Juan Romeriz. He's dead?
You?
No. He was my brother. He died at anothers hand.
Must you do that?
What?
Sing.
It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Are you always this pleasant? You know what you're problem is?
I hear you.
The river.
That's all?
That is what bothers me.
I'm leaving.
Leaving what?
England. There is nothing for me here anymore.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
The sea and I don't agree with each other. Where we off to?
France.
How long is the voyage?
What are we doing here?
Living. Remember?
To ask her to dance.
She's the King's cousin.
Yes.
What worries you?
No. What am I to do?
Well?
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
Agreed.
I would like to say goodbye.
How comes it your are not afraid?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
We had a bargain. You promised.
Aye?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
The past?
Sometimes.
I cannot stay.
Why not?
Leaving? For how long?
Why?
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
Huge.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
My name is Jennifer Hillman. I was at the police station earlier today--
I remember you.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Are you a cop?
No. I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
Corpses?
Yes. How did you know?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
If it's good advice.
This is. Go home. Stay out of this.
You're hurt.
I'll be fine.
What's going on? Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
About what?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
I'm interested in mythology.
No.
Yes.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
Good evening.
You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Why? Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.
Is it?
Yes -- it is.
Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan. Do you know who they are?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
--for three hundred years.
How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.
Would you like to see it?
I've seen it.
On the back it has--
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word: Courage.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
We're holding the workers down below.
Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
How could they get by him?
We found him this morning.
What's that next to him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I like my work.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Oh -- I almost forgot. Your head.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
That's what the Kurgan said.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries. I can wait a little longer.
You know it's not safe here for you.
I know.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
No.
How can that be?
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one. It's a better place I go to.
I love you, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I'll no forget you.
You kept it?
What are you doing?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I heard voices downstairs. Is everything alright?
Fine.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Why?
I don't know. He is the stronger one. He has a power--
Do not underestimate the power of your heart. Your dreams live there.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Good afternoon... ... Shirley.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Mike! Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
I guess so.
Fuck guessing. You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief. Absolutely.
Talley.
Dead end--it's a clone. What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I understand.
I want a message sent: No fuckups allowed.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
You should warn them, Sonny.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
Jen? Are you all right?
The car. All you want is the car?
Stay down! Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
I'm going to my desk.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Mars, watch the cops! Kevin! Watch the back of the house!
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up! Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Try to act cool, okay? He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working. Why even take the chance?
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Shut up, goddamnit! Just calm down!
That's why we gotta keep going. I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We could've gone out the back! You didn't have to shoot!
Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I have to tell you something --
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That cop didn't pull his gun. Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Bullshit. Why would Mars do that?
Jesus. What is this?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith. What if he wakes up?
That's crazy, Dennis. The cops will see us.
Not if they're looking at something else.
We can't carry all this. It's too heavy.
We're fucked.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
There is no way out.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>! Help me celebrate! I figured it out!
That's crazy. He's not going to kill us.
It's over. We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Yeah. I'm Rooney.
We're cool.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis. He died.
How about the cop?
Dennis? I want you to release those people.
Fuck that. They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
It's over now, Dennis! Don't hurt anyone.
Talley?
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis. They won't give you a helicopter.
Hey, Dennis? Can I let you in on a personal secret?
What?
That you, Talley?
The one and only. We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Now I understand. That helps. I can make them understand that.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that! You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Who else is here?
He needs a doctor.
My father needs a doctor. <u>Please</u>.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV. <u>Look</u> at him.
Use more ice.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him! I think he's dying!
It's a safety room. If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Who gives a shit, Mars? Check out the cash! We're rich.
We can take it with us.
That's right. That's a good idea, Mars.
The cops are comin'!
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
You got something to say?
I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
I don't know.
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that?
Keeps to himself, more like.
You have his address?
Talley lives here. I don't know if the place has security or not.
It won't be a problem.
He has a wife and kid. That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
Give me an ETA.
What if it goes south?
What do you mean?
What hospital?
Fuck that! You think I'm crazy?!
Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town?
Take it easy. Just take it easy. We're here to do business.
They're close. Let me make a call. You can see they're okay.
Where is it?
All right. Now the second one.
I need to work out some stuff.
You're hiding, Jeffrey. You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Don't worry about it. How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
You sure?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow! Shit!
No one's coming.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
We can't carry him.
You go, Thomas. You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I'm not gonna leave you!
You leave that gun alone!
Shh, they'll hear you!
He can't reach us in here. We're safe.
Want one?
I don't drink beer.
What do you want?
What?
Make the pizza. I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here! Kevin's coming back!
Now we can do whatever we want.
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
Whatever.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What do you want?
Are civilians inside?
He said something about a girl --
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are we going to do about Mike?
What's going on?
Smith! Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him. I don't even know that I can.
Just one question. Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
That's enough.
What are you talking about, shot? What happened?
Three white males shot Junior. Mike followed them to York Estates --
Where are they?
That's not enough.
Chief? Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
Louise?
Go, Chief.
Louise?
Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me. She's at the little Thai place.
I know the one.
Chief, base.
Go.
I couldn't find Jane. She wasn't at the restaurant.
You have her cell number?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
What's wrong with the radio?
Other people can hear us. Just call. <u>Please</u>.
I'm Talley. Who's in charge?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
He says that his father's hurt.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras. Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No. He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Excuse me? <u>You</u> requested our help. You turned over command --
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine. Talley.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Okay, here's mine. My name is Special Agent Jones.
Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?
Special Agent Jones.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Not until the man calls.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath! He <u>kills</u> people!
The kids are in here!
Where's the office?
How about you and your sister?
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al.
Can you get into the office?
Can you open them?
I opened Marlon. I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names. It's all businesses.
Yeah! Here's a name. This is somebody's personal tax --
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
Where are my children?
Did you find the disks?
Yes.
Then you have everything. You can put them away.
A man has my family. Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell. He was on his way for the disks.
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
These disks . . . where are they?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I guess we each have something the other wants.
I guess we do.
My people are good to go. You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.
We're almost home, you and me. Keep your shit together. This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
We, who is we?
Paul!
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Paul... ...I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Name a price.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
How many in your family?
Ten.
And four children?
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
What's happening?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Their people?
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
What is it?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
Satellites?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
He did.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You said you had no whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
Whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I'll be over.
We must go to the Diplomat.
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
Where are they going?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
I am on a list! What list?
You lie.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I led no massacres.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
What do you mean George?
) You cannot kill them all.
Let's go.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
Great, I really need a shower.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Where are we going, sir?
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Perfect timing.
I would never do that.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Who did you call?
Call, sir?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What do you want?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Excuse me.
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
You have our cards.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
I will need a suite.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Move? Where to?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Do something.
No.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
I couldn't help.
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Paul, don't let them die.
What!
This won't do.
Any luck?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
What about us?
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
What for Paul.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
Go out! Where?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
No, no.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
I have a confession. When we met...
In Ruhengeri?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Yes.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
What?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Why?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
A car.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
I have to stay.
No! Sit down now.
Let me go. Children get off.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
What's wrong?
Oh, my babies.
Can I have your name again?
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
What's wrong?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
How much beer?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
When?
What is this about no water?
Out? Where are you going?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
Paul, are you there?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
There are soldiers.
Where?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
So what stopped her?
Not yet.
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh dear.
Looks like we're it.
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
You're not my list.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Melissa!
What?
Three times, to be exact.
Excuse me?
Where is it??
I'm sorry --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
This thing's going nowhere.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
You said that was an accident.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Prove it.
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
I'm better than that.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why?
Thanks.
Most fun I've had all day.
What? Deep down inside?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
There's always exceptions.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
You hear somebody?
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
What are you looking for?
Cheery looking bunch.
Or an on-line computer.
That's crazy!
This is the best we're gonna do.
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
What --
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
Run.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Don't touch me!
Could we have a word?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
Jesus!
Question answered.
Steven --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- wit...nesses --
No...
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
You think this is fucking funny??
No, no, it's just --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
What?
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
My wife. Where were we?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
And then what happens?
Do something!
Please! Something! Oh-God!
I'm ready now.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- my loss --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I think...I may have the answer.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
What is it??
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
Fascinated.
I'll take my chances.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
-- it wasn't me.
Then who did??
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Of course he did, for God's sake. Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.
And you think it's in there?
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
Please.....anyone....help me?
Melissa...?
For the love of God....please...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Sara...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
I feel something. It's faint, but...it's there...
Damn it.
What's the matter?
What was her name?
So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her?
It might have been her mother.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Town records are coming up now.
I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now.
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
By killing them?
By freeing them.
I don't understand.
What do these ingredients mean?
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Can you talk to her?
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's down. Help her...
Help me! Please!!!
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure. Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did. Lived here my whole life.
Look daddy! It's empty!
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
Don't be afraid!
Oh my God! She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
What's the matter?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What?
What the hell is that?
No. Maybe it was Aubrey.
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
Were you fooling with the power?
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off. The videotape...
So what are you saying?
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it.
Who?
I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
It just disappeared. Literally.
Whoa there...
What are you talking about?
She has a...friend. Colleen.
A friend?
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me. What do you mean by that?
I'm fine.
You don't think I know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
What?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Maura, what is this!
We're not going.
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Maura!
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
We don't know.
I think we should do it.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems. Unfortunately.
Where is your daughter? She might be able to give us some information.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
...at her request. She was a very religious woman.
Oh, that's nice...
Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it.
Your daughter's been taken.
I'm going to need some blood. It must be from a woman.
Go ahead. I believe right now she may hear you.
Concentrate! She can hear you!
She's coming back. Keep talking!
You must be the new tenants.
My name is Father Seamus. I'm from Holy Rood church.
Did you have dinner, father? We have plenty.
Thank you.
Well there's no time like the present. Good night.
This isn't happening...
What...amulet?
So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
How long will it take!
The rain is letting up.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Take care of the girl. Take care of your family. They are important.
And what would you do?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something in there.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
Right. Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
Not on station time.
Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter.
Something bad.
So where is it?
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue. In the club.
Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.
Look, lady! I told you! It's not my problem! I was just there!
Under The Underground. Can I like GO now?!
Uh-huh?
Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
You like ... left me a card? At the club?
I put some decaf on. Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What?
Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
That's great.
Great. Thanks. You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.
Sorry. It was my father's. It's temperamental.
Wait. Wait. The chains. Where did the chains come from?
I'll boil some water.
This is great. And it's yours? You like own it?
How have you ... ?
Wow. Lotta books. You read all these?
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured ...
Would you know this store again?
Sure. Why?
Jesus. Are you sure this is the street?
Yeah. Happening, isn't it?
Terri?
Buying some drugs, alright?
For somebody else, alright? Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
Everything sold as is. No guarantees. No returns.
No. We want ...
Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
What else came with it? Anything still here?
Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
Welcome. 38
You're JP Monroe, right?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That's ... really nice.
It's yours. You won it. It's a prize.
A prize? For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman? I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
Yes really.
Wow. Thank you.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
It doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested.
But you gave me a rose ...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else. Get dressed. Get out.
Yes.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
Joey?
Not quite.
JP?
Live and in the flesh. How're you doing, babe?
Yeah right. How'd you get this number?
Really?
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
That was beautiful.
Delivery Entrance. Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Don't say it, Hawkins. I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Show off. Hey, boss tune. "Come Fly with Me."
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Hmmmm.....
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
This isn't funny. I'm not into this. I...
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Alex!
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You got about five minutes and change.
5:32. "Swinging on a Star."
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
Boing. Uh, this I don t understand...
You re not thinking of going to...
You bastard. You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Rio, Alex? After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
We're going in from the ground floor.
Count of three?
Why not just go now?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
That was close....
Anna, I think you better stay....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
I'm a ghost. Boo.
Alex, are you....
Get 'em. They went down the hallway.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal. I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries. This is France, you gotta have French.....
What the hell....
Hit me with your best shot.
I betrayed a man. A good man. An innocent man. A thief.
A little petting is not the issue!
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Tough guy. What are you--How's your head.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Nice. But right out of our brochure.
Oh, you read that.
Actually I wrote it. It's a good sentence. It can apply to people.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
This is bueno. They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Prison?
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Catholic girls are scary...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
The C.I. what? God, no...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization. The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
I hope you know what....
Trust Leonardo....
Cat got his tongue?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven? You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
No, let me!
We're here to say, your government was right.
I knew it! I told you it was a fake.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch. What was our bet? A million?
What a pleasant surprise. You're probably wondering...
Have a seat. Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
You certainly do.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
This is the worst night...
Don't be stupid...they...
Bastard! If you were a true American.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds. If you think I'm doing another...
Hush. My employer wants a meeting.
Employer? The president?
No, somebody powerful. Oh. Look. what's that up there?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Dancing Dingus!
Something short.
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I'm happy enough.
Okay, Miss Archuh. ...I got gears to see to.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Adenoids?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
He didn't offer you money.
A sawbuck!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
What a horrible little person.
You're from Muncie?!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...You know! For kids!
Well, she probably had a deadline...
...What happened?
Sid found me the icepack.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
I know that, Amy.
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
What a beautiful thought.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh, Norville --
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Amy --
...You son of a --
Norville!
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Muncie.
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
You can't print that!
Just got hired today!
Terrific.
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
Terrific.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
How long've you been down here?
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
I --
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
...Why, this is worthless.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Nah, that's all forgotten.
...It is?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Oh, geez.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Geez, I --
Yessir.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Sir?
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
...This'll only take a moment.
Yeah?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Well, frankly, I...
...Who let you in?
Tell him I'll be right there... Well, what is it?
...education, were you?
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
You're fired.
But, sir! --
But --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
...Enter the dame.
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She finds him.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Yellowstone.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma. They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
At the Houmfort.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I think you need some help.
I'm afraid so.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You don't believe in it?
Mrs. Rand.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Mrs. Rand...
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
Yes.
Where were you trained?
But it's so far away...
Thank you. But who sits there?
-- But, you're an American?
Don't worry. I wasn't missed. The only important man here is the owner.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Where do you think you're going?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph. I have to keep the lady entertained.
What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She's dead. The dead ought to be buried.
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Can't I take it for you?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Why was the maid crying?
I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
I am not a frightened girl.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I suppose so. Yes.
And charming?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I heard you playing.
You didn't drive her mad.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I wanted to help you.
Help me? How?
She was beautiful.
You want that?
What about her?
Why?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Got a meeting uptown.
Right o'.
Benjie!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am. Say, where's the wife?
OK, OK, the defense rests. Want another?
No thank you. We should be off.
You're staring at me.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You want to go?
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
So early?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
You all right there?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
That shirt?
What?
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
See for yourself.
Don't start.
You think I --
I have no idea.
What do you mean?
Don't be dim.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
It's a starting place.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
You've...
In the car.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
You're not going to --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ready to go?
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Hi dad.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Anyone special? You know...
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Sure dad.
See you.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Here.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Huh?
Birth control.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Dad stop it!
Good-night dad.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Nah.
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Your toes cold?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
But...
But what?
What?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You want coffee or something?
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Well, we can talk about it.
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Hi mom.
I saw you on your bike today.
With Mikey?
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
You're not a psycho!
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
It's not a bother.
Oh.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I used to know how to cook.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Here you are.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
They say you never forget.
Forget what?
You ask what the point is?
But not too ashamed.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
See ya.
How can you do that man?
Um, Libbets Casey.
What?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
Am I right or am I right?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Huh?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Jesus, Jim!
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey. I'll take this stuff.
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter? And what's that?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
No!
The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Maybe you should have just a half.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
I do.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Stupid! Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Who said so?
No one.
Mikey?
Yeah?
Geometry?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Where you going?
Out.
Want some gum?
Sure. Twinkie?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
I don't know.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
Wow!
When worlds collide.
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
I have not touched your sh-- Stuff. You watching this?
Watching what?
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Can I come?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
With who?
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Wendy.
Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.
Well, you can...
All my model planes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
He's dead.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Well. It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Communist Viet Cong.
Want a drink?
Vodka?
It feels warm.
One more shot?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
Yes, sir.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Good.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Just after Leland Street.
Nice kid.
So far.
What's the D.A. got them on?
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him. In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
I have to get back.
My partner...
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old. She went to a party Friday night?
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
We already did.
Do it again.
Who's that?
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
Duggar called him?
It's legitimate.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell. Her things are in the house.
I know.
No. But I covered it up. I lied.
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
Oh, you know. Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Right. Got lost in the rocks.
No.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What are you doing here?
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
What?
Good.
No.
That's right.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house. It's signed. Personally.
Where you signed this?
That's right.
She wasn't happy. I was someone to talk to.
How do you mean?
Randy Stetz?
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
To do nothing.
He's asking everybody questions.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>. On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
No way.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Goddammit, Hap. Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
What is it?
Did you love her?
Huh?
Huh?
You heard me that time.
She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
After that she left the party to go to him.
How should I know?...
Ran like hell to go to him...
I don't know.
You don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You're not missing much.
I was her best friend.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
No...
I don't know.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!
Who?
My arm!
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
What was it?
No game.
I'm sorry?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
No.
But you wanted to.
You gave her gifts.
Yes.
Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Told you I could write an ending.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Yes. Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Wild card.
Monstrous.
Yes, and very beautiful.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Are you the leader of tis group?
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Then there is nothing.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
Then God does not exist...
I have not spoken to him...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
Your lover.
No, my beloved, my child.
If you say so. You are innocent.
She is.
We want no quarrel with him.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
That's what the one who made me said.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
No.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Your melancholy eyes...
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Why always on this night?
What night? What do you mean?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I didn't realise.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
But you're the fairest by far.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Stop her Louis!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Not you my dear.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
He jests.
Why does he call you that?
Claudia! You did that?
You want me to be a doll forever?
Claudia - don't -
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You both did it?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Don't mock, Claudia...
Louis, look at me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
What was that?
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Yes.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
She's no vampire.
This is no performance.
This is monstrous!
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
So you felt it too!
He can protect us, Claudia.
But if she dies...
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
They would have killed you -
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Diane!!!!
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
How do you mean, start?
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
The crucifix -
What have I done?
Dear God, what have I done?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Fascination...
Have you ever been caught?
But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Paris? You came from Paris?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
The girl, Lestat -
Lestat - finish this -
Unless I make her one of us...
NO!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
Lestat!
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I didn't want to kill her.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I have to go now Lestat...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
So shall we begin? What do yo do?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
Can a vampire feel love?
Shall we go on?
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
Did he die in the fire?
Lestat escaped the fire!
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
You promise to care for her then?
Yes...
Yes.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
And the child who did die?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Is that bad?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Your what?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
No.
Get lost, you scared me.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Say yes.
No.
The number's unlisted...
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Okay, okay. You're right.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here.
Karla! You promised.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But...
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
No way.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
You get any sleep at all?
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
Karla!
Julie...
Let him go. I believe him.
What do you mean?
Be careful, Julie.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Julie?
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited... Who was that guy?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Ray, I can't...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Ray...what are you doing?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Who?
Voodoo.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
It was one year ago...
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
This was not my idea.
What?
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Julie? What's wrong?
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
...Why?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Hello?
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Hey --
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
I'll come with you.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
Ahh, that feels great.
How's Julie?
Why? He can't help us.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
How much?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Don't really have the market for something like this... I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Not anymore.
He leave you?
What's going on?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Cool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
How's the water?
Where is everybody?
Take this.
They were cut loose.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
What is up with that weirdo?
Where is Miss Wollsten?
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr. Jacks 
Drunk again?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
We will see who is the first to die.
) You feel the symptoms?
They were gore before I came here.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
No. She shall not be left here.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Where's Thea?
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
She has never mentioned her family.
What are you doing?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
You are fortunate in your father.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
But one must love a father.
I felt he did not like me.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You wouldn't tell that 
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Do you mind if I go with you?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
I can't understand that.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
But the war, the army  they need you.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Listen to what I say --
Theodosia --
Daughter -- my daughter --
You're crying. Why?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Then foreclose!
But they're somebody's children.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Who?
Get that ladder up here.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
George . . .
Stand back.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Good morning, sir.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
You what? To save me?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Go through with what?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
It isn't me!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
You know where he lives?
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
I . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Not a soul.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Violet! Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Ernie!
Hiya, George!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Is this the place?
Of course it's the place.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Well?
Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?
Hi, Daddy.
Well, what happened to you?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Want to give my flower a drink.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
There it is, good as new.
What?
Will you try to get some sleep?
It will?
Daddy!
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Hee-haw!
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
No charge.
What boat you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
I'm all right.
She's swell.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Oh . . .
George! George!
Yes, sir.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
No.
Anything I can do back here?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Say, where's Mother?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Hello, George, how are you?
George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
What's that?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
Nothing.
Where are you going?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Violet Bick!
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Hello.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
When?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
All of it?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
I'd like to do that.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Yes, sir.
Have you notified the police?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
Well, hello.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
Uh-huh.
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
You may kiss my hand.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
In that place?
Oh, no.
Come on, tell me.
Ouch!
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
When did you get back?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
Have fun.
Hi.
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Where're you going?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
I've eaten.
I guess you forgot something.
Huh?
You forgot something.
What?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Sure, sure I am.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How about that one there?
How fast does this go?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Great! Find one for me.
Wheee! Faster!
How fast is enough?
My hair's getting wet!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Someone pop your balloon?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady.
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
Is she responsible for the punch?
No.
Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?
Why not?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shut up.
Turkeys! Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
That's awful.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Over here. I want you to meet somebody.
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Where're we going?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
But we had it! We were headed right for it!
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Coming up! Give way!
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
I don't know.
Coming up!
I thought you said she was going with us?
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Hey!
Sean! Catch the rope!
We're hung up here. Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
Tina!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey ---
No! It's still there!
What is it? What's there?
It's still there!
Good morning!
Aren't you off-duty?
On your own time?
Happy to do it.
Chief....
Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
In here.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess.
Positive I.D.?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
What about that camera?
If there is, develop it!
I know just where to go.
Not the drugstore!
Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
You're too close. Back off.
I'm going out there.
See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it.
Where to?
No place special. Just hanging out.
Every day?
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Do I have to?
I'm going.
What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
Bartending? I'm 17.
Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
Because.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
Yeah?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I kind of had plans....
Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
Mike? Is that you?
Pop. I'm sorry.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
Dad, I'm sorry....
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Is that what it is?
Look at that:
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?
Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it?
We don't know that, do we?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Could be a shark. But maybe not.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Probably.
That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Where the hell were you?
Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Why?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Fooling around?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Hey! That's my boss!
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.
Eat Cheerios.
Where's my day book?
Thank you. I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
Oww!
Careful. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh. Want to talk about it?
No.
I know what you're going to say.
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
What's wrong?
What?
What'd I say?
I know you did....
I'll give notice.
What're you doing?
What is it? What's the matter?
Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.
Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now.
What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
That's it?
That's it. Just do it, all right?
Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Did you say Cable Junction?
That's what he said.
When?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
Can I go with you today?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
Dad! Dad!
They made me go with them.
Is that me?
That's you.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Now I really want to see it.
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
It killed her. It ate her.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen. She's a senior.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.
She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you.
Mike! Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Ready?
Terry! You okay?
Help! Help!
Get a dance yet?
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.
Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
No class.
Anyone know what time it is?
Maybe it's gone.
Shut up.
The wind drift is lateral.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Next week.
Come on back up here!
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Just like this.
What about sailing?
The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.
What about the others?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
But first, a little juice....
And second?
Mmmmmm.
Wait a minute. Promise me something.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Mike? Our Mike?
Be careful....
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
How much longer?
About damn time.
What is it?
Power line.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Too hot tor those two? I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
I'm not sure I can.
It'll be fun, come on!
That's not it. My dad told me not to go.
You do everything your parents tell you?
No.
I thought you were grounded.
That's fun! Let's race for some- thing!
I don't care.
Faster! Faster!
What about me?
Heading back?
He's got to help or it won't work.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
When are we going out? You and me?
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
I don't need you. Andy's here.
You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I want Fruit Loops!
Eat Cheerios.
You're going out.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
No.
I want to go with you!
Quiet! Shhh!
Michael....
Yeah.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Brody's riding his tower.
Wave to my son.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Oh, my God....
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So? So?
Be reasonable, please....
We're ready for you.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.
Go on, you're tired.
Don't feel bad.
It would make a marvelous attraction; the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely. Good idea.
With those camera lights and...
I don't understand. Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Sure am.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Yeah. Down there.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
No.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
How many sharks have you killed?
Thank you.
Well, not much longer to go.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
Look, Kathryn. They're jealous.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
Damn it. I can't understand! I gotta go, hon.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
How come?
I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton. He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
Okay, forget him now. I'm going to pick up Sean. Take a ride?
I can't leave now. We taking Sean out?
Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch. You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
They're coming with us?
Where's the rubber band?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn. Real cute.
Honey... you all right?
No.
Are you scared?
Damn it!
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
It's romantic down here.
Oh, yeah. Very.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What's wrong?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
I talked you into this?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
You all right?
I think so. I'm not sure... Are you?
Michael...
Don't think about it. It's over.
You're going down there again?
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Oh, yeah. Really nice. Who's your designer? Sassoon Shark?
I got it on sale. A real steel.
Here.
What's that?
Kathryn...
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Change your mind?
No.
You amaze me. I'm more scared than you.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
Sounds wonderful.
You want me to stay?
Get some sleep. And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Finally.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
You don't.
They said you'd be here.
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes. It's faster.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did. He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
I have to get out of here.
Come on.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
It's a shark's tooth!
So?
What's the big deal? A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
That's just it, Michael. We don't!
What do you mean, we don't?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Somebody better get down there!
Come on!
How is he?
That's right.
Who's going to do it?
Me.
Michael, you're not going down there.
I am. You're not.
But you --
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
Go where?
On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.
Fine. Have them do some.
I don't know. They're nervous and skittish right now.
Okay now. Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use. They won't come into the lagoon.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute. These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton. They're dolphins.
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no. That won't do.
Unhappy combination. Most likely one's inside the other.
I think we can capture it. I'd like to try.
You can get killed!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
I will.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Like hell!
I want that shark alive.
You look like an orange worm.
Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups.
Lunch for Whitey. Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
We're taking that shark alive!
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Afraid I can't do that.
How's sleeping beauty?
Still sleeping.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Could be a new dance... Walking the Shark.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I. But for different reasons.
You were quite daring in capturing him. Very skillful indeed.
Skillful? I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello. I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Well, Doctor. You've got your shark.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
He's big as a bloody bus!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
I knew it; it's my fault. We moved it too soon.
Don't blame yourself.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Not good enough.
Give me a ride?
Sure.
Musclehead?
He's missing.
Sure. No problem.
Sean. Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out. Think I'm catching a cold.
So, you just get here?
Massachussettans aren't.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be. High and dry.
You were great out there!
Did you see me?! Wasn't I terrific?
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
I don't know, what else is there?
I know! We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Now what's this do?
No... It can't be.
Let's go, let's go!
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod! Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Back, Kelly. Lean back!
Did you see that?
What?
On monitor three. Was a glimpse of something.
That?
Yes, there is goes.
Bring the crane over. Come down. Easy down.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
Make sure you put this back.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Yeah? Well, in that case, have a drink.
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
Filter system number four. Is it large enough?
How far away is filter number four?
Five hundred yards.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I'll go with you.
No way.
He's big, Hutton. You never saw anything so big. Watch yourself.
What kind of trouble?
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
I know. But we show it's not closing.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We see him, Mike. Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.
Sharks???
In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
I want to see Kathryn.
Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me. I gotta go.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
She still talking to you?
We're in love.
Sure.
No, really. I've never met anyone like her before. This is it.
Yeah, right. That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
That bugger moves fast.
Give me a 400-foot magazine; we may be down there for a while.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Thea....
It has its virtues. It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said? Come inside....
You're welcome. I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Yes, I did.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
He was doing his job....
Where are you going?
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
No way....
It sure is good to be home....
Make a list.
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
I miss him, Matt. I still can't believe he's gone.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
My brain is shrinking. There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
What's wrong? What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
Where is she?
How could you do that? Your own daughter....
Where's my mother?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Henny Youngman....
You caught me....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
We'll be there....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Get the bang sticks. We're going down.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop that....
Stop what?
That....
That hurt....
Serves you right. Will you please stop....
I see what you're doing....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Are you all right?
The fish. Check it....
You check it....
He heard that.
A big one....
Don't be late.
In a minute....
Yes!
You can stay in my room.
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Your father was six then. Just like you....
You're coming, aren't you...?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
I put everything in my room. My Teddy bear is joining us.
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will. I'll miss you, Grandma.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to get out of the water....
What?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
Mom, you're upset. Sit down...Please....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Oh, I didn't mean.... I'm being such a Grandma....
I didn't mean to start that....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
All you all right?
How are you doing?
Okay.
I'll be all right, Michael.
I want you to give up your work....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're having a good time....
I enjoy his company....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You're not a pain in the ass....
That's it? Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased. I really am. Really....
No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
It's late....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I m not unhappy. Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little. It'll work out....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I don't want to talk about that.
You hungry?
It got him....
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Promise me....
Can you just go off...?
Flies the plane....
I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it. It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
What are you doing?
It's just like driving a car....
Where do I pull off...?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
You promised me a drink....
Sharks come and go, Ellen. People don't have anything to do with it....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
All or nothing. You want to roll them for me?
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have my own little island.
That's hard to imagine....
I could take some time off....
You're always taking time off....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
What?
I borrow it without telling him....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'll get it back next time.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Want to go for a little ride?
You the architect?
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret? Something no one else knows?
Yes I can....
It was theirs anyway. I 11 buy us all a drink....
I hope she's a good sailor....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane. It's attracted to metal. The electro- magnetic impulse....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Keep it steady....
Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
Come on, Hoagie....
What happened?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
I don't know what the hell to say....
Yeah....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Inch by inch....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Feathers all over the place....
Let me speak to Ellen....
I'll get her. Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop farting around....
Stop busting my hump....
How many...?
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Forget it....
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
How many?
Stop busting my hump....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What?
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
I don't know shit about electronics....
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
What she's got. Nine knots....
How long have you known Hoagie?
What?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
How long has he been here...?
Who?
Hoagie.
I don't remember. One day he was just here....
Bring her about. We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
We lost it....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I don't like it....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
You getting a reading on them?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'A Moray eel....'
'Snuck up on me....'
Shit....
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....
All the time....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you. Get it on me....
Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
How much longer? This is supposed to be your party.
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Oh, Jake...
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Where's Lenny?
Gone to Ben Masters' place. Cow tipping.
I'll take care of it.
Did you like that, Mama?
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
What do you think?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
Not for me ..
How's the new residence?
O.K.
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion. What exactly you doin there, John?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
You want my advice?
You gotta stop smoking ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Where is everyone?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
We're going.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What do you want it for?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
That isn't what you said before.
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I'm asking it.
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Bits.
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
How do you know her hair's black?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
Have you got a print from the hand?
No, Sir.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Three or four.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
And did they?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Is this normal?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
What are you looking for?
Vehicle references.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I know what a "witness" is.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
Yes, Sir.
You must have some idea about him.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Me?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
No.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
What are you reading?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
Oh.
Are you married?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Pray?
Have you known her long?
I know what you're like ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.
Which is what?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know.
You're looking worried again, Helena?
No I'm not.
Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.
Why?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
I'm going back to the institute.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u> ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
I know about alcohol, John.
You do?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
Interview over, Blattis ...
You find something curious in that?
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
You think he still loves her?
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
Is that Margie?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
You want something, darling?
She married some English prick.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Ugh!
That's right.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Okay, this is working.
Now.
This can't be happening to me.
I just heard.
What do I do? How do I spin this?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
Jerry. You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
Don't say it. We're both ragged out right now.
Listen to me!
No.
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
No one has ever dumped me.
Oh Jerry.
Wait. Did I just say "hon" to him?
Don't let him stay up too late.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Let me think about that. Want something to drink?
I see what you're saying.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big.
Reporters, Jerry. They been callin' all night.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Oh come on --
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no...
Hmm. Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
You think so?
Wonder what he said.
But I mean really... wonderfully... great.
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay? Whoop. Wait.
No, that's fine. What calls came in today?
... light.
We are?
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work. We're going to save the world.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us... okay. Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Thanks.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
Too bad.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Do you have something to drink?
Beer okay?
Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you a cab.
Don't worry about me. I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
Me too.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit. You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Good. Good. Glad is good.
You don't have to explain.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
Oh good.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
What?
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Same to you.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
Right. I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht. No problem.
If I said that, would you stay?
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
What --
It's not fair to you. This whole --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run. I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
Why fucking not! I deserve it.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I know. I watched it. I sort of know it by heart.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
What about medical?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Good.
No no. Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
First you gotta tell me something.
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, thank you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Denver is where he should be.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Said who? Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Yes.
Show. Me. The. Money.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
No.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
-- the kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Great word. Towel?
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
What's wrong.
Forget it. Forget it.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind.
I'll get you some quick work --
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
The kid is amazing.
You never had The Talk, did you?
No.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Don't I know. Now go home to your wife.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
Not everyone has what you have.
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend.
That's an answer.
Damn right.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry! You made it --
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
What --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Jerry Maguire. SMI.
Bobbi Fallon. BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
How sad --
Marcee. How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Don't be silly.
He took a shot. He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You okay?
I'm fine. What's up?
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
... dick?
You'll lose.
You wanted smaller.
I'm over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
One-two-three, swing.
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
No.
They do, my brother.
Hi.
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
You said "fuck".
I don't see any.
Funny.
What's going on, Jerry?
Show me the animal, Jerry!
I'm scared. What is it?
He's gonna have nothing left for next season. They're letting him kill himself.
Can you be quiet?
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Shut up!!!
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
What is it?
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
No, it's...
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
It's not safe.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
What?...WHAT!?
Sweetheart, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
We should try fishing again.
You mean it?
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I dont know.
I thought you were an expert.
Eric!
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Absolutely not.
They're here.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Baryonyx?
Not with that sail. Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
I CAN GET HIM!
NO!
Hmm?
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.
You remember the sounds they made?
You think they could talk to each other?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A well-accepted theory.
Eric, your parents are both here.
In Costa Rica?
You're Alan Grant, aren't you? I read both of your books.
Which one do you prefer?
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
Know what this is?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
We need to head for the coast.
Are you sure?
Why?
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You should.
We're safe!
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I have never been on this island!
Well that's good.
Amanda!
Billy!
You. Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
But alone? We always had great success together, you and I.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
It matches the pictures.
You hear something?
Any damage?
You are an academic.
Former academic. Now I actually make things. I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
What?
Well? Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes? The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane! I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
That was about a year ago.
Well, is he?
No. Richard talked to his parents.
How could you possibly?
"InGen." What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you all right?! Anything broken?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Okay.
Where do you think you're going?!
Killing lessons? Heartwarming.
Had to. To keep him still for the trip.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What's he got in there?
Their what?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
?!
It has a broken leg!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do they want?!
No.
Lava?
No.
What are they?
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
We can't stay in here!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
It'll hold!
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
Something's wrong.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed. Very deeply flawed.
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Because it exists.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes. And people will live in the absence of truth.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
No! We're an independently funded expedition.
Funded by whom?
Oh, God.
What?!
Ian. It's guano.
What?
These formations. They're dried --
That must be interesting. What drew you there?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
-- way we could safely --
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
We have to send someone to look for him!
Ask her.
You've got to be kidding.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
You're sure we have to?
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
So how much for our first tour. Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
What?
The door security systems are shutting down.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
What now?
Fences are failing, all over the park! A few minor systems, he said!
Find Nedry! Check the vending machines!
Phones are out too.
How many lines of code are there?
Uh - - about two million.
But would we get the phones back?
How would we cut off the lysine?
How long will this take?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Alan? Where are we going? You see something?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
These are dilated. Take a look.
They are? I'll be damned.
Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Are you sure?
I have samples all over the kitchen.
There you are. Out you come.
Oh my God.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Oh my God.
But you know, I should really be the one going .
Why?
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Mr. Arnold? He's not answering me. Okay I'm on the grating.
They died together?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Oh, Ellie, look. They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
They do smell. Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
We were right!
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute! How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie. It's so beautiful. It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right? You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, get the gun! Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect!
I'm going with you.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
C'mon on, this way.
No. We can't.
Why not?
It's all right.
That's right. Will break through.
I get ah - -
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Oh, imperfections?
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome. That's what?
Dino droppings?
Can we chance moving him?
Faster, faster!
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Seven days?! Seven days?! Oh, great. Oh good - - clever.
Yes?
- - shut up.
Hola, Juanito
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
Grant? You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
I can't see.
What are we looking for?
Up and down, up and down!
Hey! Where did you find those things?
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course. There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I read your book.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.
Tim. Which car were you planning on - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay? Can you move? Tim! Are you okay?
Tim, are you okay?
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet!
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
That's a good idea.
You'll probably be safe enough on your own --
I doubt it.
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know. What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
Take a bite, take a bite. I'm not letting go.
You know what this is? It's a dinosaur egg. The dinosaurs are breeding.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
It's a bit of a climb. You guys think you can make it?
I can't! I'm scared!
Go, go, go, jump!
Are you crazy? What if you miss? I hate it up here.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Cloning from What?! Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You have no idea.
You're married?
What'd I touch?!
Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
Their radio's out too. Gennaro said to stay put.
The kids okay?
Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared.
What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say I was scared.
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Where does he think he's going?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
You're sure?!
Oh my God!
We gotta do something.
What? What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Can't you stop these things?!
Sorry! It's kind of a ride!
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Ah - - they're here.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim! Lex!
He's knocked out! He's knocked out! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! Daddy, daddy!
He left us! He left us!
Liar! You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe?
It's safe.
It's safe.
Go that's the way we're going to go. What do you say?
Hear that? Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I'll stay awake.
All night?
Go away!
I like cows.
Watch how it eats!
Please!
Let's go!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
What works?
John, John.
Don't do that!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Well?
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
What's going to happen to the goat? He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know. I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
They don't bother me.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo! Hey Lex, com here.
What?
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy! It's too late!
You're gonna get electrocuted electrified! The power's coming back!
Hello?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Fifty.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Chain saws.
Jesus Christ!
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Mister Biller?
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I really think we should go back...
Hello?
Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Quite a circus.
It's still on.
What?
What happened?
_Krueger_...
Who?
Three. Where's my client?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
You watch this garbage?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Well?
Doesnit sleep?
He wets the bed?
Oh?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Cute waitresses?
That's open to debate.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
Great. When can you do it?
What are you doing?
Where's he going?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
You know how to use one of those?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
And if he's not?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
What happened? Where's Jason?
You work in the insurance department?
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
Fine -- terrible.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories. They're fantastic.
I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
You work in the cemetery.
A man must eat -- And drink.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Yes.
Will you do me a favor then?
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger. An error like this damages my credibility.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning -- Or should I say good afternoon?
You're just doing your job.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
In a small way.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?
No.
He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
How long were you and Eduard --
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He wasn't robbed. He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Are you free tonight?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year. I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
You don't believe that.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes. Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday. We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Eight -- and seven months.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
He was found in the River. Could he swim?
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
No. He didn't seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
I'll bear that in mind.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
What did she say?
Do you?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
-- Just doing our job.
... Why take me into your confidence?
That's <u>mad</u>.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative? Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
I'm overworked as it is. "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute. "Raban?" Where have I heard that name?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Ludwig.
You look tired.
It's not our fault. We're naturally nervous.
Oskar!
This is filed incorrectly!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
They'd drive us away. That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter. It's too late for all of us.
Then that's the place for us!
Amerika for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Get the hell out of here.''!
Father!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
I'm sorry ...
Where do I charter a boat?
Can you fly?
I want to thank you.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I can't imagine you crying.
There's a light up ahead.
It's the same image - Kong!
Jack!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Give it back!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Ann ... Ann!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
They' re dead.
Native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Man Eater!!!
What was it, Jack?
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
What?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Are you gonna start it up?
Yeah.
Why?
Coz of something I lost.
What's that?
Compassion.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
What about him? Yes.
Why? She's a junkie.
-- May I? It's so --
I'd just be guessing.
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?
No.
Well I have to close up now.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Well we're pretty --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
What is it?
What about?
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
Who?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
You remind me of my uncle.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Most of them.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How would I remember?
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
-- OK --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
What? This?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I go on rounds.
Well do you think it was him?
What do you think?
Can't you get him?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
It's kind of late.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Arlyn Page.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
What's the matter?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
-- Then you don't need me.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
How?
Why?
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Please.
Mm.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Oh look what he did in them.
Bree --
Right back at the start, right?
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Where'd you spend last night?
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Mm.
You're going back?
You wanted to, or you are?
I am.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
They don't scare me any more.
What?
OK.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Can I carry something for you, to the car? Will you kiss me?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You must be discouraged.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
Well --
John, how are you?
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Have you discussed this with them?
It's in the report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I've always respected Bree. I'd like to make something clear.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Well?
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Are you closing the case?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
He's in his room, playing.
Does that distress you?
Not particularly.
What does?
The prospect of losing my child.
What do you have here, Billy?
No. But I've been to Brooklyn.
What about your mommy?
Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
What do you like best about her?
Lunch in a restaurant.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Playing.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Greatest.
Greatest...
Show.
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Soon. I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
What if she forgets?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Okay...Same as usual...
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
That's okay.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff. It's gross.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
I want a pizza.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
You're no bargain either, pal.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
Daddy?
Uh huh?
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Now go to sleep. It's very late.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection. You're leading the witness.
Objection.
See. That's my name.
It's my name too.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
Did mommy ever see this?
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
No, son. Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Mom--I mean, dad?
Uh, huh?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Why does he decide?
Because...Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.
I don't understand, daddy.
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Who will read me my stories?
Your mom.
Objection!
Objection! I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
I do not, your honor, however--
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Six years.
And would you describe those years as happy?
No, I did not.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes. Very much.
Objection.
No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
So do I.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Eight, almost nine years.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Yes...
No.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
No.
I don't recall.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
I suppose...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
Were you?
Ted, I'm leaving you.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you.
No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted. You look well.
How's the new job?
I've seen him.
He looks like a terrific kid.
He is... You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing. I never thought he'd use it.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Okay, I'm here. Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Wow!
'Night, Jim.
Yes.
Yes, what?
And?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
How should I know?
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Yeah?
And?
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Tough... ...I get off duty at five-thirty. How long you been divorced?
I know....I know.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on her?
Oh, Christ!
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him? I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What if I fight it?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Ted? Are you there?
Yeah.
Any prospects?
Don't worry. I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
What?! She wants what?!
She's the mother. That means she's within her legal rights.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
How many?
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside. It'll be eas--
No.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
What are you going to do?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Got it.
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and Lex. The emergency number is 327-0800.
How many onions does it say to use?
Three. And add some basil.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Thelma, if I die--
What?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
Ted.
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma. You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
All quiet?
Yes, Holiness.
Where are you from?
I worry about them.
Mama, my story.
Again?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
Can I do anything I want?
No.
But, I am in charge.
I do, now.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Goodbye, Kundun.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Are you, General?
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
I have.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Did you receive the letter?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
And the United Nations? Surely?
With much bloodshed.
Yes.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
I miss my brother.
I will be back in a few days.
How many?
This many?
Who am I?
I need to squeeze this brain.
You could buy them.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
I am him.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Tell me.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Ask whatever you will.
Britain?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I am scared.
Did you ever doubt it?
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
They will take Lhasa next.
Good day.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I leave tomorrow.
But you will always be here?
Me?
You will always!
Do you think I must?
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I have more men.
Things change, Kundun.
Is that true or pretend?
It is a story, you decide.
Pretend.
I want to go down there.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
Yes.
This is Britain.
Ahh.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
But, I have no experience.
You will not come?
No, Holiness.
We have.
You have grown up very good.
You, kill me?
I do.
How could I ever leave?
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
Too young?
Like my mother.
You killed him.
He just <u>appeared</u>. You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
C'mon Hector. I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>Please</u>. I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Go!!!
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Mr. Cyr!
We'd only just met.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
We are here on official business.
Cocktail?
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
And you like me.
Jesus Christ!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Again. Not to be disruptive. Do we have a problem with it dying?
Was he a good man?
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
Asia? How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
What's that?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector. I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap?
I can arrest you!!
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where is he?!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent.
He never said "go".
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again. How would you get him on land?
Right.
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
I got something on the screen.
Where? Where?
Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Almost here, Hector. Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Where is he?
<u>No</u>. Look. He's got nothing left.
You take care.
Women's intuition. Are there anymore?
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
What? Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Are you sure?
<u>Jack</u>!
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Nothing's real.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
No.
Eh. Fuck it.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
What?
They could try to tranq him on land.
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?
Yeah. Thanks to you.
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells. A museum sent you?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Never been to Maine before?
Why are you here? Really.
I <u>told</u> you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
I'm not making it up.
Well. You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Oh my God.
What?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is. It <u>is</u>.
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Baby crocs?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I beg your pardon?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay. We're up at six.
Good.
Good. See ya soon.
You okay? Kelly?
Yeah. Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack. I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Like little children. You okay?
Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>. Shit.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
No thanks.
Keep it dry. No swimming.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well. Goodnight.
Ssssh!
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Maybe. Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Okay. Okay. Okay.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
<u>No</u>. I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.
You calm down!
What?
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
Well...
He doesn't seem to be swimming. Is he swimming?
He's floating. Take it home.
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
Hector!!
We gotta get to Hector!!
He's through fighting. Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Well...
You sure? I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...
It was... something meeting you.
You think?
Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
We set?
I'm ready when you are.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
What's that?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
You said nobody came in here!
Get back from the shore. We know how fast he can leap out.
Now I'm gonna puke.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
I can't. I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
He's done. He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
<u>There</u>? That's the morgue.
Yes.
Is the dead guy in there?
I wouldn't.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well. At wakes.
This is a little different.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Seconds. Three, four.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Yes.
You talk to the married couple?
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
You have a thing against museums?
I got nothing against--
You're sort of a rude person.
Was he swallowed?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
What?
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
You hurt his feelings. I think you should go apologize.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
You like Jack?
<u>What</u>? I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What was that?
Are you alright?
Hank?
Are you okay?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What is she doing <u>now</u>? <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
What?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
They're coming right in.
Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you?
Did you get him?
Should I?
Kelly.
Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a second?
I had a great time last night. Again.
That's not what you came to say.
Kevin, as long as we... What was that last part?
The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um...
It's ten after nine.
Sorry?
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake. See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
<u>Kelly</u>--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have. How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
You and Kevin.
Kelly--
Backstabber?
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
Why not?
Lecter said a lot of things.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Well, except for the one girl.
What girl?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
"- every day."
Hot damn, Clarice.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
You're all right! Where is he?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Jack Gordon.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Who's the subject?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Miggs has been murdered.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Yes.
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All that detail, just from memory...?
No, I came because we need -
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Five... so far.
All flayed...?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
I didn't.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Your bleeding has stopped.
How did - It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Ahhh... Why?
Yes.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
The death of my father.
A cattle ranch?
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.
Did he try to?
He kills w-
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
Early. Still dark.
I heard a strange sound...
What did you do?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.
But you could. You did.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Yes. I'll tell you.
Starling.
You know I can't make that promise.
What...?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
My God, you've grown up.
We leave in the morning?!
Are you alright?
Can we rest soon?
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Your "father"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
He did?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
The Ottawa are gone.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
I'm sorry.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
Much further?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
No. I will find you.
Are we safe?
Maybe...
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
When? How?
My letter...
There was none!
What?
There was no letter.
And by sea!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Some say that's the way of it.
"Some"?
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe. Take her and get out.
We were headed...
How far is it, scout?
Day and a half Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not! And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Who were these people?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
That is the truth!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Where do we go from here?
We don't.
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
What did you say?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
That we did. John. But the horicane is near trapped out.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Got a reason to stay.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
And what is that?
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!
First rank! Second rank! Present arms!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms! Present!
Sergeant Major!
Sir!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Excuse me. What did you say?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Yes.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Gold could be arranged.
For Munro children?
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
What is enough?
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Yes.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
The honors of war?
Granted.
My colors?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Qui vive?
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
You mind if I take a look at this?
What's wrong?
Dead? This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
He did.
Here. Put this on. You examine him.
I'm not a doctor.
And?
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
They found this?
No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Was there such a thing?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Be careful with it.
DeJesus! A readout!
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him. I saw him move.
It's got Hazy!
What has?
I thought they were your friends?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Jesus Christ...
Can you fix it?
No way...
I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?!
Go on!
No!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
How do you know it was Williams?
Huh? I...uh...uh...
You did good...
What?
Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great. Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Sixpack?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
How's astronaut training?
Why? You going to give me hard time like the others?
No. I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Shit! He sent them all.
They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour. It's ruptured an air duct.
We made it!
It hit me! Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Where's Doc?!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Excuse me, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay.
Okay, number 23's full.
And it killed Bo?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
I know that.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Do it.
What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
You got money in this tub?
Personal effects...
Who else...Sixpack.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
What the?...
Bullshit.
What happened?
It...almost got you.
Still bothering you?
Itches like hell.
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah? How'd the kid hold up?
At least we get time and a half. That's in the contract.
You let him get away!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
You guys are crazy. What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving! He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Typhoon?!
How'd you do that?
Getting some food.
Look. Water.
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick. She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus? How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Clear for pickup.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What is it?
Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
What is it?
The shack...
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It saw us!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Your pocket?
The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.
Bitch! Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Hardly.
I'll kill him!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
A what?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Yes?
Well?
Apart from those shotguns.
What's that?
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
You get the guns?
There are no others.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
They were . . .
You fucking well have to get 'em!
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I hate these Southern shites.
JD.
Chris. You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Nope.
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Yes?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
You all right back there, mate?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
What are you doing?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
How long has he been in there, son?
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
It's not him, Dad.
All right, Dad.
Yeah?
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Who was that?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Dog, I have found the cash!
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What they like then?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog. That's the last bag?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
There is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Where?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Invitations.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
And look what happened to that.
That's it all done, we are off.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Right as rain.
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
. . . What?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
For half a million?
That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
Go on.
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
And?
Hello, can I help you?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
I'll only be a minute.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
That's going on optimism.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
What's left over?'
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
Six.
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
What are you carrying, Willy?
You jerk--
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
So?
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Oh, come on, Amado--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I can't take any more school.
--you're going to be on your own.
They're not going to jail.
That makes it okay?
They stole our land--
How do you think you're going to make a living?
And what did she do?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Yes, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The--the officers.
Well?
You really want to know, sir?
Please.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do whatever they tell you--
I mean, follow orders, sir.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Why don't you start with that?
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
Private Johnson!
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You're testing me?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
I hear they're closing that post down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
That the word on our boy?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Charley Wade.
That badge--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Yeah.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got a cause of death?
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
He swore by it. What?
Just wondering.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Whole different story; isn't it?
You little pissant--
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Do I seem jumpy?
You were in a fight--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Same weight I always was.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
350 pounds.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Hey, it's the General.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
I never met her.
Where'd he get all this?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
My mother said he never asked about--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
No sir.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
He a Black man or an Indian?
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
So I'm part-Indian?
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Dad--?
I have a B average.
Homework?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You wouldn't?
How's your room shaping up?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Are we going to ever see your father?
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
You lived in the States for a while?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
This place is a gold mine.
What?
It's a lead mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
It's not just cactus. There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Cliff--
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
Maybe.
Mikey--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Mikey look at this--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
So where does that put us?
Seriously.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
That ring--
Treasure hunter?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Pleased to meet you.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Substance abuse?
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
So.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
This is an official visit, then--
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Why would you want to do that?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Eladio Cruz.
Reputation?
Protection?
You carryin' a firearm, son? Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Senora Cruz?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
This girl has a child?
We have a daughter.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Never heard from him again?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
No.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
You thought any more about our murder?
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got an idea what happened.
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Buddy Deeds--
Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
The Perdido thing?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If you spent a little more time training them--
Mami, how old were you when my father--
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
There must have been somebody.
I was too busy.
Thank you.
I never said that.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
People didn't complain?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Of course you can.
What?
Mom?
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
What's she singing about?
She finally got in--
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Enough with the clothes--
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
I only went for my last two years.
How come?
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
It was for personal consumption.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Well, you were working there--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Something wrong?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
He's all yours.
Field trip?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I thought you got through that pretty well.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
People liked him.
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
Your boy, there--
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You've got your mother, your kids--
I should get back.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean what did we know about anything?
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah?
Wow.
Yeah.
How come it feels the same?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
How long have you lived here?
Two years.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Like your story is over.
Pilar--
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
We start from scratch--
Yeah--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
The shooter local?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
You're out early.
Yeah.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I been working on a few things.
Uh-huh.
I'm going over to the other side.
The Republicans?
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Just doing my job.
That the problem, son? You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
We'll get 'em-- So you livin' out here now?
Yeah. It's quiet--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Sure.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
No--
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Payne.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
I know that.
How come you don't took familiar?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell her?
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
Thirty-five bucks.
Hello, L.A.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
They go together.
I've heard a name. Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
Who is he?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
How?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You heard right.
Why?
My life was too weird for her.
Billy? This was on Miller's forehead. Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
I mean, there's no instructions-- What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew. He'd seen these files and knew.
Hokey enough for you?
Thanks, Billy.
How'd you spell that again?
D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
You did. Didn't you?
Why would I do that?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Who did this?
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
He's a priest?
I don't want him getting in the way.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
About?
Death.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I'll tell you.
Anything?
If you've lied to me to me --
Oh Christ! Oh Christ!
Jesus. Valentin. What did you do to your face?
Like the look of these? I made them myself, to set him free.
If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.
What is he?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
He's with us...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm.
So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
You don't?
What's the connection?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Does that mean...?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
You don't believe me.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
Harry.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight?
He's good.
Are they treating you okay?
I don't know where you'd start.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
Why? Because he had you?
He... didn't have me.. I told you-
So why did you marry him?
That's my business. Harry.
Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go.
Okay. I'll keep digging.
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He taught all this to Swann?
I told you --
Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
It's okay.
No it isn't. You can't help me.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nothing?
I was so afraid.
Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. He's dead.
And they all came...
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
What was that?
Are you all right?
Harry?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
You can't.
No! No! No!
... oh... God...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Don't look.
Harry?
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Harry-?
Valentin?
Good. There. Yes?
Crank call. I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone. He would have done more harm than good.
What about me?
Bad show last night?
The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic...
... they believe you.
Yeah. Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there?
Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.
And this Butterfield guy--
--vanished.
Are you finished with me?
For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
You believe that?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Trickery and divinity.
So could you walk on water?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
They weren't worth a damn.
I heard he was the best.
You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm not saying another word. You damn fool. He's a journalist.
Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
With what?
Great accent, by the way. Is it Brooklyn?
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
What are you, my mother?
We've never met.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in-- Shit! I'm outta here.
Whose is the car?
Mine.
Nah. You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Any movie stars buried here?
Probably.
It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you. I tried the hotel.
What for?
Left alone? Somebody's been murdered.
Yes. It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
What for? You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I can't let you in.
Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
I tried to pay you off.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
D'Amour --
Shit...
Him too.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
Shut up. We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.
You need an ambulance.
My God.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Hold on.
I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible... coming home...
The Puritan?
Yes...
Where'd you learn that?
What?
That.
At birth. I don't know you --
Was he taking a lot of risks?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
You know Vinovich?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
People are pretty cagey. Who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
Look, Ma, no wires.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so. You need me alive.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I did it for Dorothea.
Oh yeah?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
I don't know what else to do.
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.
Who else did? Did Valentin?
Yes.
They got here before us.
... no...
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
This is where we killed him.
You didn't try hard enough.
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
No. I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
I got to go. I'm late.
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Have we met before?
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
He's not! He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
Fuck you.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me. He's got... got into my head.
Swann? What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done. I have to.
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
No!
Yeah, they told me.
Hello?
Bob, it's me.
Ok.
You'll do it?
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.
Oh.
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Ok.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
Of course.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, its easy.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
No, you smiled.
I don't remember.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Ok, whatever you want.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Oh, for her show?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Oh.
You're possessive.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
That's too scary.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
You made it.
It's for my daughter.
How old is she?
Four.
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
Where's your husband?
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
Do you know where we are?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Charlotte?
Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
You're leaving right now?
Yes.
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
My stockings.
Yes?
Lydia?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Ok, well... I love you.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Like Japanese food.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to-
What?
Do you want to talk to Zoe?
Yeah.
I guess she's busy.
That's ok.
When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello?
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Great.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Excuse me?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
What?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
Why do you have to defend her?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
How'd it go today?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
You wanna come?
Sure.
No, what are you talking about.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Hair stuff?
See you later.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
Will you please stop smoking?
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Its bad for you.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
Lauren?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
John! What are you doing here?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
It's amazing there!
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
I missed you.
How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
You never said anything to me...
Shi... Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest dream.
Bad?
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off. Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
What? That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order. What a nightmare.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright?
Claire...
What're these?
I don't know. What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home. So how's work treating you?
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
What time did you make it for?
Yes.
And how would you describe him?
Quiet. Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
George, come in. What the hell happened to you?
It's nothing.
Sure it is. If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Not the guards. Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
My secretary?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
He will. He has great faith.
Is he going to be okay?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You'll do it?
How're you doing? Looking lovely as always.
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
You fucking bastard.
Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect. The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Father, I'm right here.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Um hm. That's right, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak one.
Father, please don't die.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
How many weeks are you honey/
You need his blood-type. Like right away.
Well I know he's come here before.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh my God!
May I help you?
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil. That's correct.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
So...what did you think of the tape.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
What do you mean?
You're sure? There was nothing?
So what'd I miss?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
We need to talk.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
Trick him.
The good outwitting the bad. It's like Birdson had a split personality.
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So what?
Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother
Do you know your parents' blood types?
What are you looking for exactly?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
You okay?
When's your birthday?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
Are you alright?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
No oxygen to the brain.
Maybe that's my problem.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Plenty of time.
What are these?
What did he say to you in French?
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
Oh, Peter.
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
I know who he is.
Maya? What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya. They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
You don't want to face it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You know what? You can go.
Get out of here.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
I plan to. You want a tip?
Lemme guess. The lottery.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
There weren't any voices.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey! Mr. big shot.
What's this?
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
Thanks again for everything.
What's up?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
Where is she now?
Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.
I hate it.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
nothing.
Taste this.
I can't eat before a game.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
What?
Monica. What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
Dad around?
What?
Hi.
Need any help?
Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy.
How is he?
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
So what do I do?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Don't curse.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's not it.
What are you talking about?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
Okay.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Are you okay?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.
I can take it.
What?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
What?
Can I take your coat?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
I'm an English major. You like English?
Sort of.
Careful.
Huh?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Uh-huh.
Wait...
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'm so sorry. No one would switch flights with me.
It's okay.
Hello.
Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
Why not?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
To do what you love.
That too tight?
No.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No one's forcing her.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Found? I'm not some charity case.
I know...
Mom tell you to do this?
No.
Damn, Lena... Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
You do.
Yeah, right.
You ever been in love?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You lost your head.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I know. But chances are...
Hey, munchkin.
Dad. What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
You shoot like a girl.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
What's up?
Just wanted to say good game.
But?
No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
I know.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?
Well, what do you know.
What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Just like that?
Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
I wouldn't know.
What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Just not my type, I guess.
One, up.
So...does it hurt?
It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
You do act different.
I don't like flowers.
Oh.
How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them.
Kay.
I think we gotta kiss now.
For how long?
I want to ride my own bike.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?
I don't have to do what you say.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
What?
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Way to hoop.
I know this. What do you want?
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
What's that?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
So she's honest.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
God, here we go.
That's it, give it your best shot.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
See you made it.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
Hey.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
He ain't Spalding.
Guess not.
Mulholland Drive.
Figures.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
None of your business.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Why?
Four.
What?
When'd you get this?
It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...?
What was that about?
You finish the reading for E-con?
Yeah.
What?
You do see me standing here, right?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
It's okay, little baby.
Forget Tonya Randall.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
So how about a little one-on-one?
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I...can't.
Why not?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Nah. Don't sweat it.
Quincy...
Hey.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Who was that?
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
Look, this party's whack. You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
The "man" again.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica, Kerry.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
Stay!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
You're what?
When did you decide all this?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Alright. I heard you were in Spain.
Just something I'm trying.
No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm alright. But you can sit.
I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yup.
What are the doctors saying?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Not for Quincy McCall.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
We won the championship.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Funny. I never did.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up.
Actually, I don't...
What do you mean?
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
A rest?
Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
You visiting?
Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
It just isn't.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Like what?
Maybe go back to school.
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone.
What's going on?
You asked me what was missing.
What?
From basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Better late than never, right?
I'll play you.
What?
One game. One-on-one.
For what?
You're out of your mind.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?
And what happens when you lose?
Hey, girl.
Hey.
No.
C'mon, girl, you live next door. Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Give it yourself.
Zeke.
We should head over.
Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.
With who?
Business folks.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Nona, please.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been?
What?
We still have to go?
What is this?
Uh, your earring?
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
Okay.
You hearing me?
How was your game?
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
You scared me.
Sorry. You okay?
Guess he talked to you.
Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Just...leave it alone.
This is just about money, you know that.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Why not?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
I don't care about the team. I care about the school.
Yeah? So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You work too hard, Pop.
What people?
What mess?
there's this thing out there. This paternity suit.
Tell me what?
I just told you.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We need to talk.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father.
Lucky kid.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
From your mouth.
What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
No.
You want me to fuck off?
Yeah.
What surery?
Your teeth are straight.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
You smell like trouble --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --

What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough. I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --

Yeah.

No.
Who was it?

This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend.
Is it real love?
I have love.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
No. I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.

You're a friend of the family I presume?

That's right.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"The" cause of dullness in others --

I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Mmm.Hmm.

So boring, so useless --
Are you asking me that?
In aid of what?
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
Not really.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?

You deserve to die alone for what you've done.

No. But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley. You're the smartest.

And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yeah.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Yeah.
Ok. One of those. And...um...Barely Legal?
yeah.
Do you have that?
yeah, I said. Is that it?
That's it.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29. Thirty minutes or less.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
We need more dog food --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stand up.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
Alright.
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Go to bed.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
....Why does he do it...?
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
It's not right.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
I have money.
...what...?
I have money to give you.
What is that?
It's frogs. It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
M'lady...?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
No, M'lady.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry. What is wrong?
My Queen...
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two. Not one. But two.
Mother -- ?
May I speak with you? Alone?
I am preparing for a ball!
What is it, mother?
I wish to discuss your brother.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother! He is dead now! Dead!
Louis, please -- !
What had you to do with this, Mother?
He is your brother!
No, Louis! No!
Your Majesty...
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Wh-- Wha--
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
What do you propose to do?
It can. I know the way.
What are they doing?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
What is that?
A body.
Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.
Who is he, Aramis?
Switch?! That is your plan? It is ludicrous!
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted --
How is he?
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days.
You grow fond of him. That's good.
Go on.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Now. You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?
Hang himself?!
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Poor Phillippe!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. Do you notice?
Where are you going?!
Paris. There is still much to do. We'll be back soon. Be ready.
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Bloody hell...
He seeks redemption.
So what has changed?
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
No! Stop --
I cannot betray Louis. I will defend him with my life.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Mother of God!
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb? We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
Aramis! Athos! He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Not just a baby, Porthos. I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king. Louis!
No, not Louis!
Coming?
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
Who?
D'Artagnan watches everything. We have to be lucky.
Can we eat... before we go? This excitement's given me an appetite.
D'Artagnan. Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
He gets one day of confession each year. Today is the day.
Who does?
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
Do I look all right?
Goodbye, father. I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
Thanks, but not for me.
Midnight! Mon dieu! Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
You knew this was happening. You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos, please...!
Get out of my way.
Where are you going?
The King killed my son!
He lies. He is here to trap us.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad. Is it something I have done?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
I decided it this morning.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it. Now leave me.
I just left the garden, it was empty. What did you see?
Your Majesty...?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain!
I was told this impostor was dead!
... You knew you had a double?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
... The ball... Continue.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
Food, moron.
What number did you tear out?
Eh?
What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.
You've... memorized...?
Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now. Where is d'Artagnan?
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Cowards! Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Exactly why it should be given away.
Sire, I --
... Nothing.
Raoul... is in love...
The food doesn't please you?
You would do that, your Majesty?
You are beautiful. You know you are.
Shall I leave?
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
Cooperate?
Every step of the way.
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Yeah?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Bullshit...
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances. Call for back-up this time!
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Find out for me.
Let's roll -
I'll take the south end -
What's this?
Nineteen eighty four. What fucking difference does it make?
Did you start out area six?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah I saw 'em around. They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Outside hacker? What the fuck are you talking about?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
So... to get the car back, you break into her house.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
And he took a swing at you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
I was just having a little fun -
And what did he do to the girl?
Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Who is it?
Where is he?!!
Speak of the devil.
Captain?
So where are you from?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You always carry a gun with you?
No.
What's going on here?
Why did you set me up?
I had to get away! My life was in danger!
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No. A witness.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
I had it all on tape...
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me. It's in a safe place.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No -
What?
Tubbs, it's me.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter? Run in with the law?
Tubbs listen! I don't know anywhere else to go! I need your help!
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story. Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
Holy shit -
Hello Tubbs. Can I come in?
And?...
I killed them.
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I've got a better idea...
1490...Breckinridge...
Donut?
I knew I could count on you.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas. And that's Switzerland's country code.
Both at the same bank...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm not going anywhere!
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
You must be going somewhere.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM I read a book.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks. I admit this is...unusual.
Are you a regular there?
Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
Did you have sex with her?
What?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
No. It wasn't like that!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
What about him?
That was Peterson upstairs.
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
In thirty-five minutes.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
How long do I have?
That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Where?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Read it.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
How much do you know?
Somebody hurt him?
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
You look all right now.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
As long as they're dead...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Run it.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There's no connection between the families.
There has to be.
He's a very shy boy...
What?
Will?
That's why the boltcutter.
It's getting late and...
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.
Parking permits...
Will...?
How far away's the back-up?
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Where the hell's Graham!
He went to the men's room.
Not yet.
...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
Ride with me.
Come on in. How about a gin and tonic?
Tonic will be fine.
How did you come to Gateway?
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
Is that you. D?
Yes, are you okay...?!
I have work to do at the plant.
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room. I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You'll let me go now?
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
Come in.
Dr. Chilton.
Do you have it?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
I want to see Lecktor now.
In a holding cell.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Linda King's desk.
Hi, Linda. ..
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
That's true.
I don't want to do that,
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
'Intimate? !"
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
To yourself...
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
No.
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
We have it good, don't we?
What the hell can I do?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Molly?
Huh? Will? Is that you?
Hello, hotshot!
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
To do what?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue, then.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
No.
Then why?
I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you.
Can you quit?
No.
And... where are things?
What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Mama was probably asleep.
I want to see you, too.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
That's not true.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too...
You going back down to Florida after?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
What's that?
Meet point's up ahead!
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... ...stop by and...
Will it keep them out?
Yeah...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Yes.
We don't know that.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Did the girl die?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Huh?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Did you get my card?
And?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
I thought you would have some ideas.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
What were the yards like?
That's interesting.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
No.
Yes.
Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
People love... comedians.
Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!!
No.
"No"? "No" to which part??
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.
Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS!
Andy?
Hi George!
Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course. But only on Monday nights.
Andy!
Hi, George! Good to hear from you!
Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
They're having a laugh...
Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?
No, it's true. I have lung cancer.
That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke.
What was that all about?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
What do you want? "Take my wife, please"??
Andy!
Five.
Twenty!
Ten.
Right...
Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
No thanks.
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
No thanks.
Oh! Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
It's me.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
How can you be so casual??!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch. I DON'T do drug humor!
Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man! Get off the stage!
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
GET OFF!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
Hey Andy, good show.
I'm gonna quit.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
Give me the book.
No! Andy, don't do it --
I dunno about this... What will my mother think?
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's so dirty.
What is this, World War Two...?
Sir, do you have a problem?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Are you at peace with your family?
Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Excuse me, Andy...
It is apparently not working.
So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Are you sure?
Positive.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge!
No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
We had a deal!!
Get off my stage! You're fired!
Uh, yeah. Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Er, yes. Speaking.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work.
Why...? Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
I saw Michael!
Where?
Hmph! They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
What's your name?
Bob.
"Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"? What is that, Polish?
It's my name.
A -- a tourist.
Then the informant is real.
Does that surprise you? It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it. Did you get anything from the room?
We'll need a search running.
They are dead. In either case --
You don't know.
The sewers. Of course.
Hurry!
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
And you are?
Smith. I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
Oh shit.
I sent two units. They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
What?
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
Hallelujah! You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
If you get caught using that --
I know, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
Something wrong, man? You look a little whiter than usual.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Do you?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Did you hear that?
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
... yes.
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Why you're here?
How many were there?
Five. Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead. All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
I need an exit! Fast!
I got you.
Just get me outta here.
I know. They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity. We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
What is he doing?
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Hello?
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
How?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
But what if...?
Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
No! It's too far away.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Do you still want to meet?
... Yes.
Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
It's an honor.
No.
Why not?
The Matrix?
This can't be...
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
More important than what is when?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
Get some rest. You're going to need it.
For what?
This is incredible. I know kung fu.
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Do you understand, Neo?
I think I do.
No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Yeah.
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
No. No! Morpheus! Don't!
How is he?
Got it.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank.
Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
How...?!
Hello?
I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
That vase.
You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you.
Who?
So? What do you think? You think you're the One?
But what?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not the One.
Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What?
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
What the hell is this?!
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
From what?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
God...
What?
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
How much like it? Was it the same cat?
Go!
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
That I would have to make a choice...
What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What?
No, you... have to be.
No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
Why?
What?
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Neo, how did you do that?
Do what?
You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Are you all right?
Can you fly that thing.
Morning. Did you sleep?
No.
Zion?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city. The only place we got left.
Holy shit!
Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?
See who?
What are they doing to him?
They're hacking his mind.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Goddamnit! I don't believe this is happening!
What are you talking about?
Why?
Okay. Store's open. What do you need? Besides a miracle...
Operator.
Which way? Which way?
It's locked.
Operator.
Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where yet.
We need an exit!
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Tank, you're hurt.
I'll be all right.
There is. We have to pull the plug.
You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?!
Operator.
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
An Agent! You have to send me back!
What just happened?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah. But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Look fella...this is private...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
That means it's good.
No, all we got is $40.
Sssh! Quiet. Y'know that's illegal.
Well the guy over there said...
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Well, we want good stuff.
Yeah.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Yeah.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash.
Uh...can we give you a check?
See what I mean? A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
No.
May God be with you.
'And with your spirit.'
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee?
Who's the girl?
Jewish...
Look at her.
Where to?
Kennedy.
I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.
Nervous?
Yeah.
You flew before?
How about Teresa? I could talk...
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
And say what?
Panther...
Panther! Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before. Until you come back.
Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Waddaya think?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You got some mouth!
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What happened to you Flash?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
It's the truth, I swear.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Don't promise...just deliver.
I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
That's not going to help.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Keep your mouth shut.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid!
NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy???
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Don't you move!!!
Back so soon.
Hello, Michael. I've got something for you...not much...but...
I think we should see your uncle.
No.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What are you going to do? Hide me?
Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
No.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
What pipes?
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Michael, give us a lift.
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
How much?
$20.
Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.
$3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Where's the rest?
You're really crazy.
Diane, how are you feeling?
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Stripper?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Take a drink!
Hey, where you been?
Oh...around...why?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Teresa.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Please take it.
Well...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
An apartment uptown? Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
What is it now?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Did you?
Bore.
A paper on that one too?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
Take your time. I don't care.
I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You're intolerable today.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself. You know that.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I'm sleepy.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk...
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
The girls like it loud.
What's the matter with this kid?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Count it.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat. Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
No...no. Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
How about me? I don't get a drink John?
Just keep him quiet.
Friends of yours Michael.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
Not bad. $20. Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
Yeah.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
That's your name?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Dinner? Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
He's coming.
Daddy! Come on, a name.
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
He's cute.
Did he? That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.
I hate parties --
I know you do, darling.
Daddy. Does your friend have a name?
-- Black.
Now, I'm getting interested. I want to know more ---
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Who?
From the Korean War.
I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
What is this?
Annie made them.
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
Yeah? And what about my enemies?
I haven't been the father to you that --
That you've been to Susan?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Honey, please.
What about the Mayor?
Honey --!
Yeah, but --
But what?
...This shit's not bad.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
And that?
What do you do that for?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Yes, sir?
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
Toast? No...just the butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations.
You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got Joe. And so do you.
Well... goodnight.
That's it. It's over. Get out.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
We have an arrangement now.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Here...
Anything else, Mr. Black? How about some water?
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.
Cold.
Yes.
Yes.
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
May I interrupting?
Who are we talking about?
Perhaps you could remind me.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
A voice?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
I'm all excited --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
Yeah, something he goes by --
'Joe...'
Yes.
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
Have we met?
No --
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
I am now.
Shall we adjourn?
No.
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew.
For how long? And why?
Mind if I throw up?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
What are their feelings?
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
That's it?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Certainly, Bill.
In English, please.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
You get not to go to jail.
You're overthinking it --
Well, I guess he's found one.
'It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
I thought so, too. Joe's a neat guy.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.
He said that?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Obeah.
Obeah evil. I not evil.
What you then?
I from dat nex' place.
You wait here'n to take us? Like you bus driver to dere?
No, no. I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not dis pain. Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
Don' be facety, woman.
None facety, mistah. You come for me? Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Doctor? What could be wrong wit' you?
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Sure.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
No. Nothing.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Jennifer.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
What?
'Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Yes?
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
How long you here, Joe?
Black.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
You're an original, Joe. A little hard to figure, maybe...
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Thanks.
C'mon, have a drink. You look like you need one bad as me.
Do I? I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh? About what?
Love.
'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
What do you mean 'free'?
You think so? How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
What are you doing here?
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I haven't.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I'm sorry. Do you live here?
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
Susan?
Yes?
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
Joe --
Oh goodness, no.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.
I appreciate you --
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.
Yes...
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
I am, too.
Has her pain abated?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Why?
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
Where are you going?
To bed.
'To bed'?
You first.
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
I love your smell.
Thank you.
-- Could you?
Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
Yes?
You're here?
He's taking a nap.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
...No.
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Where are you going?
Nowhere? I'm...here.
For how long?
I like you in a black tie.
I love you in an evening gown.
Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Well -- I --
I can tell you the when part. Tonight.
We know so little about each other --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't. That will come later.
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
I - uh --
I'm still here.
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Susan --
-- Yes?
That's it?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
You think so?
No --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
'Threw' you? Where?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
No.
What a good idea.
Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
I won't.
How long have I got?
When you go, I go.
That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
No --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Not at all.
And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you? How're you feeling?
And what?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
Bill --
Yes?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?
Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.
That's what everybody says.
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
What's it like?
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Are you going to eat your lunch
Excellent. What is it?
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Dinner? Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I don't know.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
Hello, Bill.
Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Okay. Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
What's okay?
'Fish'?
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
Yes, I saw you see me.
I'll be the judge of that.
I'm her father!
You're violating the laws of the universe.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Uh --
You are?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Say again?
You're what?
I think you heard me, Bill.
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come. She says she's in love with me.
With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
No.
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't expect you to.
Okay.
Joe, don't do this --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
He is --
I'll take it from here -- I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
I guess you have your reasons.
Yes.
Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?
I am not a dream.
You are --?
Yes.
Death!
You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do? How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
Excuse me? Could I say something?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
'Yes' what?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
I think you know --
I don't!
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you? Are you there?
It's enough now.
Please. Talk to me --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
Where are you?
About what?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'The one' to do what?
Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...
Get what?
Time.
What the hell are you talking about?
Watch it!
Yes what?
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great. You ready?
I am, this is it. B Day.
Next week?
But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I give a shit.
This one.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment? Give it some air?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie?
Yeah - Bill - How are you? You okay?
Good morning, Dad.
Will you relax? I know it is a big deal day --
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
I don't like to interfere.
Not my birthday again?
You're only six-five once.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Do you love Drew?
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Don't get carried away.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
That's all?
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Bravo.
Aw, you're tough.
I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
You're terrible.
Thank God.
Daddy, what's the matter?
What is it, Daddy --?
Are you okay?
A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
We've met.
What?!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
It'll come back, Daddy.
That was wonderful.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten? What's going on?
Nothing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
Where's he going?
What a night.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Are you relieved?
I love you, Daddy --
I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Not at all. It was fascinating.
Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating' about it?
I'm sorry --
What's the way?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
So you're a one-girl guy?
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I could be her.
Not at all.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
I've got to go --
Did I say something wrong?
Why not?
You said you liked me.
No --
...We know so little about each other.

I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
So was he scared?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
So what are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
What do you mean "bad news"?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
She couldn't.
She has no idea who I am.
Happy now?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
What sort of questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like what?

Weird shit...?
There's really people living down here?
Funny. Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.

And a right.
The Department of Public Health...

Fine. You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Oh, man, there you go again.

He's special.
My God, what the hell are you...?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.

But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame. You looked great tonight.
Please.
Do you think we did the right thing?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
We did no impact evaluation. The consequences of...
Who know? We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Thought it was my week for that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Maybe they lied to you.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
He was just doing his job.
Great crowd.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Fuck 'em. They don't know what they're missing.
Oh, no, you were-
Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...
Susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
It's me. Can you hear me?
Don't.
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
It's no use! They know we're in here!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Rub it on the windows!
What-
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us- we Goddam mimic them!
Peter-
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
C'mon...
Ah...
Talk to me.
No...
Hello.
You guys have done a nice job. How bout five dollars?
You sure you didn't see one of these?
Gross. What is it?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
What?
Not a big one. I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
What's this?
What is it?
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
Fuck! It broke the skin...
My God.
That's impossible. Insects don't...
Oh, my!
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What do you want to know?
Sure.
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Here.
What are they...?
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
But what?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul. There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
See, isn't this nice?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I want my pills NOW!
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
What?
...have to wait.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
I hope you like it.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
A toast?
To Misery.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Well, it certainly says you.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Annie, what is it?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, I know you've been out.
What?
You've been out of your room.
No, I haven't.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Be my guest.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Maybe.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Yes, Paul.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Did I do good?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work. Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Stop--stop right here.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Just leave it, all right?
What thing?
That thing. Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yes.
He's your client, huh?
You think he might be missing?
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
So do I...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Hey, Pete.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
You're still a writer.
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Great.
I thought you were over it.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
All done, chief..
- right - - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not everything. Why do you think she's really here?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
I thought you were going to dinner.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Where is it?
Afraid he's got no choice. I believe I broke his jaw.
Not much luggage.
I left in a bit of a hurry. I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
How grateful?
Well that depends.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
How do you that.
Magic...
Your room.
Mmmm.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
You won.
I suppose I did.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag? She'd never won a bloody thing.
'Thief in the Night?'
To win?
You picked another winner!
To do what?
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time. There's been a change of plans.
Oh, no, not at all. Maybe just a bit.
Ulrich will be about. He'll look after you.
Feel like pleading for your life?
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand. Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Not exactly. Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Damn. Just when it was about to get interesting.
What you got there, mate?
It is, Billy.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Exactly where is she?
Before we kill her or cure her..
We're due to take off.
Range is two kay.
There she is. I got visual.
That's it? That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up. Go, Ethan.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Do you know me?
No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.
No. Just as if I'd like to.
Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
- torque wrench.
- this is very disconerting..
Hey, you put me here. I just do what I'm told.
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman..
Hola..
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Listen to what?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Your help? What are you talking about?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.
What's you name?
Ethan Hunt.
Awfully short notice..
Care to wait a decent interval?
When they've got your recruiting technique? Not a thing.
Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Damn, you're beautiful.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I. But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide?
But I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Much.
You don't trust me.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735. It's going to be delayed.
Yes?
How's it going? Everything okay?
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Where do I meet you?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I managed.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Are you okay?
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
No. Should I?
No. You just looked as if you did.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
An idea, yeah.
Twice.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Yes, I believe that's right.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Something else?
Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Yes.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I do.
Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
I don't. No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
Well, yes. I suppose I am a bit anxious.
They're ready and waiting. You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew. Just..
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
It's the transponder.
That simple, huh?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Confirm. Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
She must still be on the property.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Now how to get in there.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Luther, say again.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs. One klick away.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You have Bellerophon.
Do I?
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help. You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Come on!
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
Only four more cars.
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
But why tell us?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Satisfied?
All ten million.
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it. Right?
Krieger.
Did we get it?
We got it. On your feet.
I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk. Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan. What's wrong with you?
Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead. Jim's dead.
Take off your coat.
What?
Where were you?
I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.
That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
Max made a deal with you?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
May I come in?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
We did what we had to do.
Kittridge...
What happened?
I sent the message to Max. Were on for tomorrow.
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther?
Two cars. Where are you?
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
Theyre dead.
Whos dead?
Are you damaged?
They knew we were coming. Golitsyns dead too. The disk is gone.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I dont think so.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>. Are you clean?
Yes.
Location green. One hour. Ill be there myself.
Youre in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Dont disappoint me.
No sir.
Yeah. I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yes. I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Kittridge.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
Information.
What kind?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.
Reach your folks? How they feeling?
Here's to you, Luther. To being off the disavowed list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
That depends.
On what?
Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that? Are you another Company man?
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC. Was. <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
Ha, dear boy! I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
What about Job?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
Zero body count.
We'll see.
Merci.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it. That's not the list.
Claire.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack. Jack.
He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack.
In position. Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Roger that. Opening doors now.
Higher. Higher.
Higher.
OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors.
The package is in the open.
Ethan. Hes out of pocket.
Sarah eye on the package. Jim, Im coming to you.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Would you remove your hat please?
Why?
I thought I was going to see Max.
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Forty-four. Forty-five.
What problem?
Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
I guess.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Why not?
You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure. If the main character does.
Ive got a shadow.
Can you lose him?
Abort. Thats an order.
Where are you?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole?
Yeah.
We dont have to, Jim. Hell come after us.
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague. The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Youre probably right.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye.
Loud and clear.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so good.
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes... Its him.
Whats the problem.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
Its not working.
Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I always check the batteries.
Its working.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I'm going.
Are you ready?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Uh-huh
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I don't like him.
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Cosmo?
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Have I been a good wife?
Yes.
Okay.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Hi. Hi.
I have my eyes open.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I don't know what you mean.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You haven't said anything.
Where's Ma?
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Here. Ti amo.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
What killed him?
Johnny Cammareri.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
In a month.
I won't come.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
He did?
Yeah.
Here.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
It's temporary.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Mona?
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're married.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You're my father.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Oh, Cosmo!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
It's wrong to just let them go.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Have you come from my brother?
Yes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Excuse me.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
I know that. I do what I want.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Why?
Why what?
No.
Stupid.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Why you talking to me?
She was right to leave me.
You think so?
Yes.
What are you doing!
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
No!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.
Me neither.
I was dead.
I've got you.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What?
That light.
It's so bright.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh my God.
What? What have we done?
Take it easy.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I'm marrying your brother!
She didn't like me.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I can't do that!
Why not?
Snap out of it!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I thought I'd try it. You look good.
Who painted that?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
Thank you!
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
It's the best thing there is.
That was just so... awful!
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
What's the matter?
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
He didn't come!
I'm here!
You're late!
This is your place.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
Ronny!
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
You've gotta get outta here.
No. I'm gonna wait.
No, I'll tell him.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Loretta?
What!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
I got things to do.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi Loretta.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You don't want the fish.
No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Maybe you're right.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I don't understand.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
Seven-thirty.
How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
How was your plane ride?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
We should talk alone.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Will you live here?
No.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
And we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Did he tell her?
Hi.
Where you been?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
What the hell happened to you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
What? He's in Sicily!
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hi.
Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
No.
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
You should think about this.
He should pay.
I don't know.
Don't make yourself sick.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Talk to him.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Moving in?
I came right from the airport.
So.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
Maybe I should go?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
I don't know.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
No idea.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Loretta...
Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Sure!
Do you have a girlfriend?
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Sorry. That was rude.
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
Nerves.
I think it's because they fear death.
May I walk with you a ways?
You knew that man?
Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
I'm a little cold.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for you.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
I'm freezing
That's my house.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Is who down there?
Cosmo.
What would he be doing down there?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You got me.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
A witch, a witch, burn her!
Burn her anyway.
There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
I see. Yes, of course.
Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
What? Ridden on a horse?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
...What?
Where did you get the coconuts?
Through ... We found them.
Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all. They could be carried.
Please!
Am I right?
Where does he live? Old man ... where does he live ...
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
No one live there.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
The same!
NI!
Oh!
NI! NI!
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right! What do you want?
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
One that looks nice.
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Oh, please!
You said it again!
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
What?
Then you shall die.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch? Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Victory is mine. I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Come on then.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Had enough?
You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left.
Course I have.
Look!
What! Just a flesh wound.
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
I'll do you for that.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I'm invincible!
You're a looney.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not! You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What is your name?
Bedevere, my Liege.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Nu!
No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
| It's not working. You're not doing it properly. Ni!
Ni!
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
What with?
There! Look!
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do. You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
A G...g...g...
Look, you're a busy man ...
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Too late.
What?
Where?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
Man!
Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Yes.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Be quiet!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Bloody peasant!
Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.
Good idea, O Lord!
Well?
... Well, we did do the nose.
The nose?
Make a bridge out of her.
Exactly. So... logically ...
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I'm getting better!
I feel fine.
I think I'll go for a walk.
You're not fooling anyone you know. Isn't there anything you could do?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
Bring out your dead!
Here's one!
'Ere. He says he's not dead.
Don't be such a baby.
I can't.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine today.
When's your next round?
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Why?
Well taken, Concorde!
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I think I could pull through, sir.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
Did you kill all those guards?
Yes ... I'm very sorry ...
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Do you want to come and have a drink?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Rather what?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
I don't want land.
Listen, Alice ...
But, Father.
Who are you?
I'm ... your son ...
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
I was saved at the last minute.
How?
No ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Leaving the room.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Yes?
If we ... er ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Right.
Okay. Fine. We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Where are you going?
Er ... + You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well, look er, I ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ... But you are wounded!
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
I don't think I was.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
No. It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
Sir Gawain.
Well, what seems to be the trouble?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
No, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed! At once!
You got my note!
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Hurry!
Oh!
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
Stop saying it. AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
You tit. I soiled my armour I was so scared!
| You turd! + Mangy scots git!
Look. I'm warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I didn't.
Bravely ran away, away.
So?
So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
She loved him.
Come on, man. There's love and there's ...
What?
You know what I mean.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
The good-looking one.
So? Someone'll send it on ahead.
Aye, but will they?
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
And she sent no word down?
They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
What are you doing?!
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
You watch your tongue.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
Aye.
She'll drop you. When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
What's this?
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
The place is a mess.
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
What's your name?
Mary Taylor, sir.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
I hope to go up next year.
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good man. And is she all right?
Yeah.
Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.
Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
What did you say?
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mama...
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
By whose authority?
We --
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know?
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Do you?
No.
Go inside at once.
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
Oh.
I wouldn't know.
Surely --
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
But yourself? What about John Brown?
I said. I serve the Queen.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Her mind is set. She won't change now.
They don't see it.
See what?
The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated.
Archie.
Yes. That will be company for you.
Mr Brown.
Yes, ma'am.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
What?
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
That doesn't make him an expert.
They're ready now.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
We took a nip of whiskey.
To keep out the cold.
What is it, John? John?
Must they always follow us?
I ordered it. It's for your own safety.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
John?
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Ma'am?
Duty?! You talk about duty?!
I'm breaking no promises!
Then why send me back to them?!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was before.
Forgive me, gentlemen. I'm late.
Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time.
I came as quickly as I could.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
This is my good John Brown.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
So?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Dear oh dear.
Yes.
Quite. I think I'd best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
Why was I not informed?
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Just them?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
Well?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
How long has he been this sick?
A few days, ma'am.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Read it.
Again?
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
Why not?
There is one other matter.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What do they want?
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
What is the matter with him?
What's the riddle?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Thanks, Albert. Think you could print up those schematics?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Dead?
Well, brain-dead anyway. Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Maybe he's not dead.
He?
The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, ARCADE.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Has anyone seen Greg?
Sick?
Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
So where is he?
Hmmm. He said you were going to have dinner?
Yeah...
So take his car home. Wait. I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
Nick...
I have to talk to you.
We are talking...
No, in person. Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
So how did it know my name, then?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Sorry. Maybe I need the Valium.
Something's happened to them.
It's the middle of the night. They're asleep. Phone didn't wake them.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
No way.
Well?
Where to now?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
That's what I thought.
It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Anywhere. We have to stop it from getting out.
It's already out.
Then where do we go?!
SLIP-STREAM.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
What are you going to do?
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
Dante's Inferno.
Alex...
What are you looking for?
Put in a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
You don't get it, do you?
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it? It's different this time.
Okay. Give us a kiss?
One. In case...
Thanks. Always wanted to do that.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
And we've still got time left. This was a piece of cake.
Hey, my strength's low. Look out for Fireflies.
Shit...
Our time's up.
What?! There's nothing here!
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer?
Christ...no time...
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
And then keep on driving?
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
How did you get here? Did you play the game?!
Yes...
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
Is that your question?
You have no time. What is your question?
I'm thinking!
Mom? You're alive...
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
Is...is that where we are? Did I die?
That's impossible.
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
It means she's screwed up.
Cool.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I am The Liar. Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...
Give her a chance, will you?
Adam, where are you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
No.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Someone's shut off my money!
I know. Where are you Adam?
And?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Cynthia...what's going on?
You gotta be kidding?
Will you meet with him?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
You're an understandin' fella.
... What??
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Your Aunt called me.
I was afraid of that.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
That's okay.
There was an accident. I came here.
A car ... a car accident.
Are you okay?
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Very pleased to meet you.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
You're still here?
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Yes, there was.
Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
Yes?
Diane?
Number 17.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No ..........I.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I think I've been hurt.
No.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
What's wrong?
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Mulholland Drive.
Mulholland Drive?
Okay... but just...just to see.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
There's nothing?
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Maybe it's not me.
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
"Really?"
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"So... surprise"...
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Before I kill you."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Good luck!
Don't stop!
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
No... but...
I don't think...
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
To my audition.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Wally Brown.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
You're so easy.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Yeah, what for?
What's the matter now?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
I just wanted to come here.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
So, you came to see if he's out there?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
You feel it?
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Yeah, they showed me
Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
The one of 'em still alive?
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Interesting.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Making ends meet, huh.
Hardly.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not here...no thanks.
Not a coke or anything?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No. I haven't seen any.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
Leave him, he's dead.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Why should I ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Now where do we go ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
I'm working on it.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
First Bank ? But how ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What are you doing ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
What ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I'm not listening.
What's the trick here ?
We drown.
How long till the room fills ?
So why this ?
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I wanted to let his family know....
You okay ?
This is cute.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Where are we going ?
I don't get it.
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
What about you ?
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
I work here, remember ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
That's a shame.
Yeah a real shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Is it over ?
That's nice. I think I lost my wallet.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
It's fine thanks.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
That's not to tough.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You okay ?
Knock yourself out.
Is it over ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
What ?
Don't eat at the console.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Not yet.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
Trust is earned not given away.
What's wrong ?
So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Well ?
Fire the whole division.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I am thirty two.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
What do you mean sir ?
Sir ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
John, sir.
Zachary.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear...
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
What was that ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
We can't afford too many surprises.
What's next ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Look he figured it out !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Was that the Old Man ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
<<belch>>
Thank you very much.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
What the ... ?
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Thank you.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Yes.
Really ? On a date ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Hello.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
What an incredible view !
Are you okay ?
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I think we should follow him...
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Shut up ! It's me.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
What ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
What now ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
He was right behind me !
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
Do you still teach?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
How did you know my name?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
THANK YOU.
Don't mention it.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Pommeroy.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup. Monday.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
Seriously.
What boy likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I already bought a ticket.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
What happened to Shelly?
She just had a baby that's all.
We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Can I see him?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Never heard of him.
How about a nice glass of milk?
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every palm tree.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Reason? What reason?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh. Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Sure am, who are you?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye. She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Well...
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Hi.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Hi.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
Hi.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
O.K. Thank you very much.
He's writing. Hello?
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Hi there...can I help you?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
My mother.
Your mother?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Thanks
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You're over reacting!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Thanks....
No THANKS!
He said it was a gift.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Getting off please.
Vada.
WHAT??
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
And I thought I was weird.
You are weird. Let's just go.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
Woah, watch it!
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
Where are you going???
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
It's dangerous!!
You mean, this ring?
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
My mother stood on this very spot.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws. My hands fit.
What's he smoking?
What do you think?
Hey look!
Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Good. I mean...
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Nick?
Yeah?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
An adventure?
No?
I'll write you ten poems. Bye.
Muh??
What's that?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
No problem.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
They're great.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
She lives here too?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed?
Committed.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Lock the door.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
You want me to come with?
I should do this myself.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Oh...what's that?
Hi!
There's plenty of fruit.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I'm just tired.
She'll be all right baby.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Excuse me?
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
You couldn't?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Oh, sure okay.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
Beidermeyer?
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Do you know him?
Arthur!!
Vada!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
What?
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
You are perfectly healthy.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Yes.
Can't you see it?
No.
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
What Hurts Vada?
It's still available I hope?
Uhh, Miss devoto...
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Pardon?
I need the job.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Uh huh?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Harry? I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Hi.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I wrote that.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Does it make it easier to win?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
What's that?
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
Are you mad at me?
What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Dance with me?
Here?
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
Rock?
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
I ahh, better go.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
How's it going chef?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Shelly?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Perfect.
Ahem.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?
I love this guy!
Dad??
What?
The money?
Goodnight Vada.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Why?
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Are they ready yet?
When?
When??
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Did I kill my mother?
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I found this.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
In the garage.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
I'm very nervous.
Why?
Are you sure about all this?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi.
Hi, is Vada home?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.
Thank you. Bye.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I paid the money.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
I wrote a poem too.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Mr. Bixler, I love you.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Who's that?
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Cause she's dying.
Do you think she is?
No.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Really?
My Dad was funny?
Is that your camper?
Yes it is.
She's shy.
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Shut your big fat mouth!
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
My ball, I lost my ball.
Hi.
Can we look around in your camper?
Big Ringo fan.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
I would.
Did you read ALL these books?
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Are you married?
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Are you going out somewhere?
No.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
How old are you?
I'm eleven and a half.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
I think it should be outlawed.
It's okay sweetheart.
I will I promise.
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
What are you saving for?
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
No, I'm going home.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got something!
Oh no! UUH.
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It's a mosquito bite.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
Your lip bleeding?
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Is that your Dad?
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
What?
Here.
Don't DO that!!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pacifist!
I am not.
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Can we go yet?
Go???
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
THIS!!
Woah!!
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
So?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Got it!
Run faster they're after us!!
I am running faster!!
Jump in the water!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi Vada.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Come on, let's go.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
So now you'll have a mother.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..
Well when you get older, you just have to.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
But, I don't know how.
Like this?
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
You better not either.
Well, let's spit on it.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya. Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
For what?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
... trouser width, this is all classic. Which means safe, something I'd wear.
I should look different.
Long trip. Pretty nice of you to come.
What?
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Sometimes I do. Like for two months.
Kindred spirits.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
I have a suggestion...
No, he's ruining yours.
You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill. We don't want your face coming off with it.
Chill? Since when do you say ch...
You like her.
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Someday she'll thank you.
Jesus. You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
Elmer's Glue?
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
Major. Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
I did what I came to do.
I'll think about it. I'm okay.
Well, we're...
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit. Right from the start.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
Well. You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
No.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory. Unassailable. Which works out great.
I've missed a step.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Ju...
... always. The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
Oh, that. I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
So... one almost has to...
Exactly.
Exactly what?
He'll see right through it.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Uh, Kimmy...?
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who? The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
In one minute. You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I never want to go through this again.
Well. See. That was a... reflex to see if it would...
... look good on Kimberly.
I saw the show.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances. Charmed to know you, Jules.
Is anybody watching?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, that's great. You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, sure.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
W...
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe. But I'm going to dance with you.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Endearingly absent-minded.
Every day. She makes the bed.
Quite the little eccentric.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I guess you're right. That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
Still. All's fair in love and w...
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos were fucking.
Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days. About us, actually.
Well. There's a lot of memories to choose from...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
Will she like it?
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
I forgot how cute you look. When you get impossible.
This thing means that much to y...
I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
What happened?
She denied it. Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Should we take a walk? Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is her family and her fault.
And your point?
Well. How come she didn't...
I asked you...
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
Uh. I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that. Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Fine. I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
He said you told him. It'd be safer with you.
Personally, I think Mr. Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got the money?
Right here.
Well, that just happened that time.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What do you have to buy?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
Winifred.
Hi! Star.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I won first prize.
You're from out of town?
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Is there food?
Barnett, please -
What's wrong honey.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
You have to what?
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
I said, I've been real tired.
Eater says she doesn't see how you do it.
What did you say your name was?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You going today?
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
She's going to rest now.
You bet.
Yes.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Whose word?
His Word.
What?
They can come to the concert in the park.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
How is she?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
What!
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You want anything? A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Whose?
What's he running for?
National television?
ABC.
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.
D.C.? Tammany Hall? He came there?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
You're kidding.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Howdy.
Where are you going?
Hey!
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
National?
Come on. He's a crook.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
She's in Paris.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Not yet.
You bet.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Harvard?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
How in the world did he get shot?
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Ester and me did; My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
Mr. Green?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
What?
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Did you see who that was?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
Uh huh.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
What's this?
Replacement party.
Who's that?
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
No.
She had on high heels?
No.
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
No.
You got a place to stay?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
No.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Mom?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I don't know his first name.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Fungus?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I don't think so.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Does their hair fall out?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
When I was little, in church.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
Do you ever do any writing?
No, I don't.
Do you like him?
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is thin?
Who is this? It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Wow!
What?
Who is this, right? I called you last night.
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Doesn't it have a name?
I have to go.
Wrong.
I have to go. He sighs.
Stay.
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
How old are you?
Older.
Thirty?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Terrific! Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
That's unkind.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
That's what you said before.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
I'm not sure...
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Fifteen minutes?
What...? 0h, yes.
You know who that is?
Yea.
What?
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
It's me. What is it?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...? Courtland wants to...
What time?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I can do benefits
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hello. John Triplette.
Hello.
Oh, no.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
For him?
What for?
What National TV...?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
An album.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Sorry I'm late.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
How's your stomach?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Oh?
I mean...
We just got a gold record.
How long have you been together?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Come on back to bed.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Why?
What?
Pleasure
What do you think of him?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You go to school together?
No, we never did that
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You do?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Where are you from?
Southern California.
You always live there?
I know a couple.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Ryan O'Neal.
You really do? ~ God -- How come you know them?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
You sure do it loud.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You serious?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
More or less.
Yes you are.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Are we in a big hurry?
You got something you want to do?
Yeah.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey!
Hasn't it?
Looked like an interview to me.
Who is we?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Thank you, sir.
Who isn't?
You been followin' the news coverage?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Susanville, Soledade.
Lobotomy Bay?
You've heard of it?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah.
How come you never talk?
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You guys stay on your bellies.
How is it?
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
You ready, Donut?
Ready.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
All right, Mickey.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Then was it worth it?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
I'm sure we will.
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
I could go for a Coke.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
No fuckin' way!
Yeah baby.
Yes.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And they made the first move?
I admire them.
Hypnotizing.
Through the power of the simple word---
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Just for fun, I guess.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
How immediate is immediately?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger?
Rockin'!
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
What the hell happened to you?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Are you all set?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Waitin' in the lounge.
How 'bout Mallory?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Yeah, sure.
When do you want the assembly?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
It's gonna be beautiful.
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
Why?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
I see.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Ya know, I was.
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
What are we talking about?
Two guys?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
And me.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They done that too long in my family.
Give her a beer.
Where' you goin'?
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
You think so, Frankie?
Fill her up?
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
Okay.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I know.
Yeah.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
What d'you want?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
Like where?
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Okay.
They say your dad's 'round town.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Thanks.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess I don't.
Thanks.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Guess so.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
His profession?
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me. Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
How 'you doin' man?
Okay.
Cup of coffee. I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Been over to the other mill?
That's two bucks, Joe.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
You must be new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Oh yeah?
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
No. My mother's dead. You goin' back inside?
Yes, aren't you?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
My father's the preacher.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
What d'you expect?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How d'you mean?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
No.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
No thanks.
Hell!
They must work on the section gang.
That's right.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
How d'you mean?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
That's why you come back, huh?
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
'Been up north?
Ain't your fault.
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
What d'you mean?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
Surprised?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
I'll see you later.
How old is your boy?
Four.
What's he like?
Hi.
How did it go?
What?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What d'you mean?
Thank you.
How about it?
Don't push me, Duff.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
I can see why.
Well, what d'you think?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Don't call them that.
What about him?
He could live with us.
Is that so?
What's wrong?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Everything you cook is good.
What about them?
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You still didn't answer my question.
You know how to box?
Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Huh?
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
Ain't that something?! That's just fine, baby.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't, Duff.
They won't.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Hi.
Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
You heard me!
How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
What d'you mean?
Duff, I love you.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Okay.
Duff--
What you gettin' all pretty for?
Where' you goin'?
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
We was just leavin', fellows.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What 'you signifyin'?
Good-bye, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
How about a drink?
What happened?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
I asked you somethin', boy!
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Great.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
That's right.
Take it easy, Pop.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?
Want me to hold the light for you?
No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Going back, huh?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Okay.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
Hello.
How are you?
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Guess it's never been easy.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
I guess I ain't.
I doubt it.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Well, if it ain't Duff!
'Musta knocked her up.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I understand.
I know.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Hi.
Come on, Will.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Let's stay here, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
Got a thick feelin' here.
What's the matter now?
Better now. Where 'you at?
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul. Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
You hate Raoul?
Your Raoul?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Omar, listen to me--
Don't give her the satisfaction. Your wife is on her way...
Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone.
Since when?
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
No. I only needed the code from you.
Take this off.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
Can you get us into Straylight?
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
What the hell is that?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
I know. You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You ran without us.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What's this?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate. I want it now, Armitage.
You've got your orders.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Are you even really alive?
Tell me the words.
The words?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
I saw your girl yesterday.
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Hey, bro.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
What elders?
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
All things possible in Babylon.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Ready?
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
No problem, amigo.
What?
Yo.
Can you take me to it?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Where the hell have you been?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Yo.
How's the ice break?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
You're late.
How's the ice?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
It's coming.
You haven't got it?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
What about the route to the core?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Case.
What about the mainframe's access code?
Wait... You hear that?
What?
Want to fucking answer them?
Hello, Case.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Case... are you okay?
And we really do have to talk.
I had to limit your options.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
What's my end?
What is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Couple of months.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Maybe something's onto him.
You've been calling her name.
Holy shit...
How long have I been out?
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm going in.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
On a good run... yeah.
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
...Feels like you.
Case...
Case... it's four a.m.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
I'll get the car.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
I'll be okay.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Something exotic I hope.
He projects with neural implants.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
I know.
Is he going to make it?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
My God... these people are insane.
Shit...
I'm still going in.
Get up.
What?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
What?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Thanks.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It is?
Yes, it's lame.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Right. 7:30.
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Roger in Op/Ed.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Yeah.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Now this is cute.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
How about this?
Cuuuute!
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hidden camera.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
Five-- Six--
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
What if I say no?
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You having fun?
God, I can't do this.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Wow. This must be big.
What!?
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Josie Grossie.
I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous.
Are mom and dad here?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Is that true?
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
And a gymnast!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I-
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
Hey, Josie, hold on. You've been hiding something from me.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
This seat taken?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Yoooooow.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Well, are you here with anybody?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Josie, you look Rufus.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Aloha! Welcome!
Thank you. I'm Rob.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
<i> I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
He <u>has</u> to know...
Shock.
<i> ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i> Jack said we should work together.</i>
Not at all!
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you? I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
You're mine, you know. I made you.
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
I know.
Just what?
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
But why? It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Taste it.
No.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Uh-huh.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
We're here! You sent for us!
<i> ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i> ... You're no fun.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
You got your room straightened out yet?
Dad's fixin' something again. Hit the deck!
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
You set this all up, didn't you? One of your sick jokes?
Don't tell me it's not the gas! Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it? Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Come back here!
He needs professional help. I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
Where's Jesse?
There is no Jesse. I'm Jesse now.
I love you, Jesse. Come back to me.
I'll kill you now.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
So, you live around here.
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
It was okay.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
What?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
How come?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Hi! You didn't have to wait.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
No, that's okay. I was just...unpacking.
I figured you might like some help.
You know her?
I think it's sad...
Are you sure?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
No. Never. You think that's what it is?
Sorry. Schneider id it to me again.
What's all this.
Like a haunted house, right? I don't believe in ghosts.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know. Where are we going?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
What do you mean?
Any ghosts in here?
C'mon, cut it out.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
Disappointed?
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it - What's wrong?
Whoa!
What is it?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
yeah, I had a bad night.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I think I better go. I'm just not into it tonight. I'm sorry.
Why won't you talk to me?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Who, Jesse?
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
Hi.
What's so funny?
'Morning.
Jess?
Huh?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad. Can I go to bed now?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Morning.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, guys.
Hi, Kerry.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks. Any cute guys gonna be there?
All of them.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
What's that?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Kristen specializes in strangeness. I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'm serious.
I'm sure you would.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I'll need to take her things.
The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
I'll get it. Please, I don't mind.
Are you crazy? You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me. What are you still doing up? It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired. Really.
Kristen, don't start with me. You know what your shrink said...
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Mom?
What are you still doing up? It's past one.
I thought I'd wait for you.
What?
Can we talk? Just for a minute?
Can't it wait till morning?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
They're healing up nicely.
I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Girl, what are you doing?
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Oh, right. You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Jennifer --
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
I know who's trying to kill you.
So what do we do about this creep?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
To old friends. And your new dreams.
It was great seeing you again. I'm glad you dropped by.
Do you still...see each other?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
That man in my dreams. He's real isn't he?
Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile?
You like gymnastics?
I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
You did it the other night.
Freddy?
Joey needs us. I can feel him.
What's that?
Nancy!
Kristen, can you pull us out?
They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off.
Are you okay?
He's gone. It's over. Please don't die, Nancy. Please.
Hi, sweet stuff. Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty. Trimble's sick.
So?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
What?
The dispensary. I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high. A night at Club meth.
What are these, beauty marks?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program. That's your office.
This is Phillip. We call him The Walker.
Max, where's Kristen?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
I don't know...
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Fred Krueger's dead. You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
It's over. It's over.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told. Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion. I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about?
You're late.
Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.
Never been here before?
My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was. Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
All right. Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
I used to be like them, Neil. I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
To who?
Doesn't matter.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Remember -- open mind.
We can try again.
Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
What are we going to do?
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Nancy...
Neil, it's no use. You saw how he is.
Your dreams?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
We'll begin sedation tonight. Starting with him.
How do we get in?
We've got work to do.
What are you talking about?
What was that?
What?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
A sad choice.
Mary Helena.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
My God.
That girl was Amanda Krueger. Her child --
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
Cooling down.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
I'm sorry, Neil. You brought this on yourself.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count. You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
C'mon.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
I'm in.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
I'm a vegetarian.
Lovely to meet you.
Wait a minute. What about me?
I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
That was such a great evening.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
Now you're lying.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
We have to. I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
God, that's an enormous arse.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
And then I... right.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
No, thanks. I'll just look around.
Really?
Oh Jesus.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
No.
No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Oh hi. Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
Here we go.
Hello. Hi. Hi.
Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Oh -- Okay.
Hi.
Hello.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
You abide by rules like that?
Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Here we are. Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Hi. Can I come in?
I don't know where to go. The hotel is surrounded.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.' How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
'Certainly. And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
You've got big feet.
Yes. Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No. What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he? It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Today has ben a good day. Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
Oh please sod off.
Wow.
You and every person in this country.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
What?
Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Undressed like this, yes.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
This is certainly... ah...
I only found out you were here yesterday.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Hi.
Hello.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you. Shall I...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Yes...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Where are you going?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
... get fired.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision. All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
And we intend to use them!
Is this your first film?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
By the way -- it's you.
Me?
Yes. What do you think?
I was called and I came. What's up?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What happened?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Ahm... room service.
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Ah -- no. It's fine.
What's your name?
I agree.
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the pain.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Right -- want another one?
Martin -- your customer.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Max. This is Anna.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no. She doesn't.
What are the choices?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Cool, huh?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two? That's it?
Right. No one else?
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome. Did you find them?
Well, okay. There's this girl...
Oh my God... Hello.
Maybe.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Was it you?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
Yes.
How was she?
Fabulous.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
M-m-m-ma'am?
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Y-y-y-yes...
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
I was in luh-love with her.
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
Get up, Billy.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yes, ma'am...
Will you come with me, please.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Is there anything else?
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Sorry to have bothered you.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
I wanna report a robbery!
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
That's it! We made it!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
So do I!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Whatcha boys playin'?
H-H-Hearts.
What's your name, buddy?
B-B-Billy.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
That's okay, kid...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
So long suckers.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...

Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!

Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Marry who?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
In ya go...
Ahhh, Billy...
Say it again.
Say... God Bless America!
God Bless America.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Ca-na-da...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
I second the motion!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Ha! Did ya see that! Hey, Cheswick!
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
They must be up there!
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What? What?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
What?
Mine, too!
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Ya know what, Fred?
Martini!
What are you doing?
A pecking party?
Did to me?
What for?
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With your own two hands?
Twenty-five dollars.
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Okay, sucker.
Giving up?
He can't hear you!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Time in! Hold it! Time out! I said Harding out!
I refuse!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Don't you have any clubs?
No!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
Why not?
Big king, too bad...
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Yeah, buddy?
Can you borrow me a dime?
'Kay, place your bets.
What's this?
Bet a nickel!
Hit me.
Hit me!
Right!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Yeah, Mac?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
I wanna go home!
Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
He's not!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
I see.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
You bet, Doc!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
I'm afraid not.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
When?
Candy. Candy, over here. Hey, Doc, time out.
Time out!
Time out!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
'Kay!
Yeah, buddy?
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You think it's funny, huh?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
What's going on?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
Somebody's coming!
Got a cigarette?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
A dime.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Yeah, what's up?
No!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Okay. How you doing?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you. Here, please take these.
What are they?
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
Miss Itsu. In here, please.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
No...
He's a patient, Rose...
Oh, yeah...
Yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Who is he?
He's in charge.
Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Yeah!
Big man!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Yes, I see it! I see it!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
I'm sure you will.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Of course. Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Tha's your problem.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Huh?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
What kind of crap is that???
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
At this hour?
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Yes, ma'am...
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
What happened?
What's that?
What?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Oh, yeah...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
He is your husband, no?
Yes, but... He was having an affair.
She was your sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand. The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You didn't have that with you before. Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No... it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Were they pen pals?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
You're sure...
Good.
Don't be afraid. You can tell me.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes. We did.
What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
Your great aunt.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Oh no. Do you?
I'm a liberal!
No...
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
We'll KNOW.
Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
But, Faith--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
You...
Hi there...
Congratulations.
Thanks.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hello? Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
Who's this?
My name's
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!! Where are you?
I'm at the airport. Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
You're limping.
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay? You want some help?
NO.
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
He's safe.
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
So?
Why not?
Why?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please. I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
So. You found him.
Oh. That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time.
Hey--
What?
Nice dress.
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music? You like classical?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
Hi. Are you... busy?
No. Are you're leaving?
I know the feeling.
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Yes. I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here.
A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
Very funny.
Really?...
That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
Sure.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
So, what are we waiting for?
What?
I don't believe in statistics.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No. He smokes.
How about the other one? His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know. I don't think so.
So?...
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
No. He's never asked me.
He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
It's a coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Are you sure?
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message. Only--
Only what?
Your brother?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You think he misses me at all?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Her brother.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Is he looking at us?
Faith--
What?
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
But how could he know? He only just met me.
Hi-iii...
Hi. Where've you been?
Sightseeing... What're you doing?
Packing.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
What about Peter?...
Who said I was going?
What?
No. No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
Yes. He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
So...
Kate is that you?
Uh huh.
Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
And you are?...
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.
A porco?
Oh.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
Huh?
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Damon Bradley? That's why you're here?
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you. It's only Peter.
Thanks.
Right now?
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
Well, where are they?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Then don't.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
That was the idea.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Mmhmm.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Don't say that!
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Wow... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
Father Barry.
Hello, Edie.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened? What happened?
Terry...?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles.
Give it to me my Pop's job
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
I think we're O.K.
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You know how the Sisters are.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
In braids? That's right.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What's that?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What?
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I'd better go in.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
The Golden Warriors.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning.
The things that go on.
How do you like that one?
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Listen, you like beer?
I don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers. Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
How do you like it?
It's quite nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Now what are you doing?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really believe that drool?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Yeah, yeah... . This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
You're not sore at me?
What for?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It's true.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
I don't rate it.
Pigeons... .
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
My hand.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
Edie.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Thanks just the same.
Well, it's over.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Jimmy...
He's going to have to grow up too.
Am I on my feet...?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You are like
Where you goin'?
I don't want to hear it in there.
But you've got to listen to me.
What are you going to do?
About Edie?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Good luck.
I want to see you, Terry.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
...walk?
You can!
You all right, Nolan?
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Down to the wire?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Never will be much too soon.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
What?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Wilson yeah yeah I fought Wilson.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Really?
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You'll work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
I told you lay off.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Looking for me?
A cheese-eater! You're kidding!
Is Johnny in?
No.
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Hit me again.
No advice. Just whiskey.
You ought to go home and take care of that
Terry? What do you want?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.
Count this.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Not a dent. Perfect
My favorite little cousin.
Do you?
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Aw, Johnny... .
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
He don't, huh? Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
How'd you get that.
Listen, Johnny
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You got some nerve.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan... Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Maybe I will one of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery. Let's turn back.
But horror stories! Why all the time horror stories?
That's life. My kisses are alive.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead? In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...
Look!
I'm so frightened.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
I'm frightened. I'm so frightened.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not. I hate you!
<i>Him!</i> I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She was?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me. Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
It would seem so, Master
Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
There are others.
The moon sinks lower into the hills! We must hurry to the finish.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
There is yet time. Don't you want your own pleasure?
The time...is short.
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
They are live ones?
Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He wants us.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
What do you suppose for?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
That's funny, Adele. How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.
What's free about it? I'm looking for work.
And the one driving the other car?
Glenn Michaels.
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
Adele? You in there?
Oh. Uh-huh.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall! I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
What?!
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag?
I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Now that's a really big house.
Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
And she saw you?
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You find out?
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
I don't ski.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Shit.
What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
Really? Huh. He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
I have to qualify, is that it?
Shut up.
Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel. Listen --
Where are you? I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her. That's a dead end.
Sure, Daniel.
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.
You excited?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Quite a mess.
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Who was the friend?
I'll need a last known address.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up." Or can't you guys read?
There a problem, Foley?
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
I bet. How much?
Let's go outside and talk.
Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push him off.
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop. I'm very excited about tonight.
You know how to use one a these?
Good luck, Richard.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Not until recently.
Nervous?
You comfy?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Buddy. That's his given name?
So, what's <u>your</u> name? It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>. Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Really.
I mean, romantically.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
You know who this is?
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
Really. He has a cop's face.
How do you know? Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
You won't do that.
Why not?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here. There's only one waitress.
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
You like bourbon?
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
You did?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No. What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game. I've never played this before.
It's not a game. Something you play.
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You believe that?
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
You coming back?
You getting serious on me now?
I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
What're you now, a desperado? Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So. What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else.
Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
In the trunk?
What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Okay. How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Thanks for your help.
I don't know. I never used a gun.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
My ex-wife's in Miami. It's nice down there.
No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works. You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
What's to think about?
Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down now. Haven't we, Jack?
Foley? That you?
How are you, Richard?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Have they got Midge up there?
What do you want from me, Jack? Name it. You want money?
You gonna write me a check?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i> What kinda name is that?
Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
There were others.
Yeah. That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, take the exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>? It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Some<u>one</u>? Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
You there?
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
What-- when?
That was some shit, huh?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
Foley? Oh. No, it was one of the Cubans. Linares.
You're a fighter?
How you know that?
I can tell.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
You're not my type.
Don't matter. I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
What do you want?
That's not Maurice?
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
You not with probation, one of those?
No.
You a lawyer?
Glenn? No, I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed here last November.
Here? In this house?
Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
It's a --
Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
Which one is that? The ATF guy?
He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically. They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
You used to like it.
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He doesn't even look like that.
No?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Was it Foley?
Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He waved to you?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
You gonna go get him?
He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida. Palm Beach.
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
How do I look, mama?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Well, I need that...
Faux goose down.
Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Midge.
Forget about her. Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Ten gees.
I think he must've fell in.
I found a rubber.
...the fuck is this...
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red? I've never seen him this way.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.
He, I'm R-Red. Red S-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Nervous?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
You're Walker, right?
Yes Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You liked that?
Hale-what?
Sir, I --
Hey. You. Mr. Coma.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Yeah.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...
A m-missionary?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!! In the gun lockers!
Earl! You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
How could you do this?
Nah, you go on.
I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Yeah.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Upset? Why should I be upset?
Sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
Waitress! Four beers!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
We gotta face some facts here.
I was grieving too.
Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
You left her. How's that for a fact?
Don't blame her, Rafe. It's not like you're thinking.
Get me into a plane!
Where are we going?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
It's tight.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank. You?
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Fun today. Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
No. You're trying to beat me.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours. Land of the free.
Danny...
I can't make it.
Yeah.
You were more like brothers.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Well...sure.
So beautiful!
No baseball diamonds, Red.
That's bullshit, son. But it's really good bullshit.
Good luck over there McCawley. I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.
Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Sorry to trouble you.
How'd you get this?
Boxin'.
Win?
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
What else can we do?
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
I have'na been able ta --
Hello, Lilla!
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Welcome to the singles scene.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Peggy Sue!
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
We're here on the sofa bed...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
You got a Tab?
I know. Put Scott through college.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
Oh yeah?
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Want me to drive you home later?
Would you?
Looking good out there.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
What am I going to do with you?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
That's real big of you.
Does this mean you like me again?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
I'll never give up.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Yes, sir.
What would that be, sir?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Did you study for the test?
Are you for real?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Terry, slow down.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
I wish she hadn't.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
I thought I knew everything about him.
What?
Young lady, you're drunk!
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
That would be impossible.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Hi, Dad.
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
He'll win.
Oh no!
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
I have a note.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.
What about?
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
What do you mean?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
Maddy's party.
Where have you been?
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
What are you doing?
I'm just happy to see you.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
What was?
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Come on. You can't be serious.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure.
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Yes... why?
What happened to you?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
What?
I think so.
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready! Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
All set?
So where're we going?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Zowie...
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
What did?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
It's weird...
What do you mean?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
I know, Mom.
Mom...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Jesus.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name... ?
Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
Drew!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
We're not skipping this treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm ready...
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
Take it easy, Walter.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh! Sorry, I...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
New baby?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Continue.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
We?
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I buy that.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
They didn't fire her?
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
PARRTYY!
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.
Get it?
What do you want?
Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Sure. It's fine.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I've considered that.
What happens?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
What impressed you about him?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
No. I didn't.
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Yes.
What?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Thanks for coming by.
What can I do?
Something like that.
Do you take risks?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.
What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do you need a break?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Some do. I didn't.
Yes.
Really?
Absolutely.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Answer the question, please.
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Where's Dad?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
Good school. What year?
Second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>... ... gay?
Aren't you?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
How many gays do you know?
How many do you know?
Lots.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Duh...
Since when?
Have you changed your aftershave?
Joe?
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Whoa, whoa... What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
How did you do that?
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Julius!
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Jesus.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Don't wanna miss this.
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Oh, Lord....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Bottle-count.
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Power cells.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
But I just wanted to say --
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
One or two.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Just come with me!
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
There....
Like the light is scalding it.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Possibly.
Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Can we switch?
Hey.
Hey, who?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
And him?
Big Evil?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
S'matter?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
What?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Well, don't ask me to.
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
How many?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
He can pilot?
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
We cannot go through there....
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Well? Is it just the pump?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Why did I fall on you?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Fry?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Owens!
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You know who Muhammad was?
Frightening thought.
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Hasan?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Imam. Slow down.
What?
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
I would rather we all stay--
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
What're you doin'?
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Suleiman!
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
SULEIMAN!
New Mecca....
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
We crossed our own tracks.
She's the captain, we should listen to --
...then we saw this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Nice embellishment.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
What's her name, anyway?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
An' this?
So much for your nightfall.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Take it.
What, it's broken?
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Where does the river lead?
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
What are you doing there?
Do you have to work tonight?
No.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?' I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'Then how do you account for me?,
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
The evidence was very meager --
You didn't think so then.
Well, maybe they're not.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
A toy. It floats on the air. Try it.
How did it go?
Got your sensors?
Yo!
Geiger counter?
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Will he live?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
What happened?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Landon! Send a last signal.
What signal?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
If only we could get a fix.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I told you not to bring the other one.
He wouldn't leave her.
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Why special?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
One is in a museum!
Thats a lie!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Sustained.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I don't know.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Of course.
Tell him to pull back!
Sure. In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Speak! Go on. Speak again.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Maybe not.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Taylor, please --
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Why not?
Would you like to come along?
We can't.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
He's moving his fingers!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
This is his assertion.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But there's the doll, sir.
But the proof? The doll?
Bunker...
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
So what's the problem?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
You lame Taylor?
What?
Where's he from?
Where's Elias come from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
Yeah.
Feel good?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
...don't feel like it either.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
I volunteered.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Nah...
No, thanks...
What are the heads?
Must be somebody?
You volunteered for this shit man?
What we got here a crusader?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
What are you talking about!
You know what I'm talking about!
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Or Reno? They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'll make one for you. I live there.
Well..
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I haven't been invited.
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Would you mind?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
They might think I was running away from something.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
No, please.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
And do you amuse the guests?
No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Dance?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Much too late.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
I don't.
Nice of him.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
Want a spike in it?
Bad?
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
What time is it?
Quarter after one. Why?
Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Certainly not to me.
Cold?
Is this the best you can do?
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
I didn't notice him.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Couldn't be.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Us?
All right--following me.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Do you have to leave the note?
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
You wouldn't like it. I've been there.
Well?
See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Cold?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
In a way.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
So could you. But our records were a little against us.
No. I paid him off.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Not this one. And not Mitchell.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Magruder does.
Me?
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
Yes, Miss.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer? Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Please answer my question.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Who told you I was married?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
FLorida?
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
If I understand what you meant by that.
You understand perfectly.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.
Points very straight to her.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Very ridiculous.
They call me Jeff.
Time's up. I'm off the case.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you. But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
To do what?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
I know that.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
He could have killed me a dozen times. You'd never have known.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Morning. Any calls?
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
All right. Get him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
You asked for it.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine, Mrs. West.
What'll you have, Margo?
Martini.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Who told you my name?
What?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Thank you.
Could be.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
In case you want to have us followed.
I don't.
Time for a little chat?
If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Could we discuss that some other time?
Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
A couple of hours.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Would that make me a heel?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
Information.
Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do. Far too often. So long.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
You nasty, sardonic--
He saw my face too.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Floater?
Not a floater. Only just dead.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.
What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.
I need a receipt. Sign your name across the flap.
Open it and count it.
You in charge here?
So it seems Sergeant.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I'll know when I find it.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Was that about the right angle?
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Do I know who lives down there?
Pretty big chance, huh?
This is the shell. What about the gun?
So?
No suicide.
May you what?
Oh nothing.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Of course not. Thanks for telling me. I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Not if it clears the air.
It does. May I go now?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield. The Mitchell case.
Mayfield? She fit into this?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
The card says so, doesn't it?
No.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
I don't know, sir.
Well, find out. Who's covering her?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
Get out of here!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
So-so.
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
That's not very kind.
What's this?
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
How about your new friend?
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
She is beautiful. And young. No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you.
He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Yes.
Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
Here I am lecturing you. Have some pt.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Thank you.
Hello. Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Penfield. James Penfield.
Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday?
Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.
No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Aha. James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
It's terribly good.
Committed to memory. Forever.
Attributed?
Of course.
Congratulations. Who with?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks. I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No. I'd want to--
Are you going to have coffee?
Yes, please.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless.
Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Too bad. What did your father do?
Both dead.
Damn. They're early.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Again?
Why not stay?
I have to be up early.
Me too.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you.
You don't trust me.
I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
I might.
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
That'll be fun
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Not here.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon. I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh. Tell me what you think of this first.
It's shit.
You approve!
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
That's enough of that.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Still in love?
Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off?
Yes, finally.
Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Thanks.
Why not sit down and wait?
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
Have you come to talk about me?
What period?
Suez. 1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
What about the Cromwells?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
Dad.
Yes, you said.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
I've got to be going. I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
No.
Yes.
What would you call it?
I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.
Jeremy! How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
It was last year.
Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat?
Oh no!
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
You'd look naked without one.
We'll see what we can do.
Promise?
Don't close the door. Don't turn out the hall light.
I won't. Goodnight.
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.
Something happened. You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
Thanks for stepping in.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it.
Where?
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest? Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Ever done this before?
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
I'm not armed.
But you're not alone.
You gotta tell me where she is.
And let my policy expire? Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
How was the beach?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
Babes.
What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two years.
That's the point, isn't it?
Pappas. Angelo Pappas.
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Yeah. What's your theory?
Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
... Four months. June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Big zippo so far. How about you?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Got it.
Aw shit.
... so I started tailing him.
They're on their way to Maui.
Time for lunch.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
The hell are they?!
They took a left at the next light!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Angelo! Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
What do you want?
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh. That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
You had enough?
Look at you.
I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Those are cold.
I... I gotta go.
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Billy's on it. Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Mean anything to you?
Blain... ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
You saw what?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
You lift off in three hours. There's one other thing.
What's that, General?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
He knows our defenses.
I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
He's not really my uncle.
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
I like your hat.
Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
It's... it's not like that.
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
You what?
Congratulations, sir.
Who are you going after next, sir?
You've got a lot of nerve.
Mr. Harris.
Yes.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure. For five bucks.
That's ridiculous.
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Nice car. Yours?
No.
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good. You're obviously mechanical.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
What's your name?
What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Three hundred.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward. My name is Edward.
Get in. This side.
What?
Better believe it.
My raincoat's in the back. Put it on.
Off the boulevard.
Room service. What do you drink?
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
Want to know something? I don't quite know. I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Let's talk some more first.
Right. So! In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they? Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
Why?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Good morning.
You didn't wake me. I'll be out of here in a minute.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
Where'd you go?
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.
No? Why's that?
I buy companies.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
What are assets?
Vivian --
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
All right. How much for the week?
What?
It'd cost you.
Of course. How much?
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Never answer the phone. Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.
Any good?
Hello?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
I have work to do.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Okay.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Thank you. I would. Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
No.
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Real genuine guy.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
You asshole! I can't believe what a --!
Well, it's true. Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Vivian...
Fuck off.
Do I look okay?
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
Shush. Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
I've never been on a plane before.
But don't they have it in English?
I more than liked it.
I know. I'm glad.
Did you?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
Right.
It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
Business.
Yes. The man made a business decision.
It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
I didn't think so.
Vivian...
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Of course, yes. If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
My what?
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
What's up, where you going?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
Cynthia's not coming?
Love this car! Is it new?
Oh, god, what?
Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.
Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
Yes...
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
What!?
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand. You're fired.
All this because of that whore!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
No, let's go to work. Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
'Lo.
Kit! Where've you been?
I'm getting dressed now. I'll be over. Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Kit...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Go for the bucks.
I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy.
What kind of school?
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Couple a hours.
Yeah. Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second. Here's some money.
Yeah, what?
Rent. You're late.
Don't give me that. Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Kit give me nothin'.
You bullshittin' me?
<u>Housekeeping</u>. I come to turn down the bed.
Is that all? You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I'm just going to my room.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
What's your name?
I got a dress.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
But I always eat like this.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Hi, Barney!
Miss Vivian.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes. Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things. How much is this?
I don't think it would fit you.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
Excuse me?
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah. Thanks.
What?
Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
He will come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I killed him myself.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- --please.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
Can you move at all?
I will never doubt again.
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
You're quick.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Hello.
It's you.
You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- where?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
What?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
Yeah. It's really good.
-- wait, just wait --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
What?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh no. No, please.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
What? What?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
No. To the pain.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Your guess is as good as mine --
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Now?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
No.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
What? What?
He's already dead.
Sir. Sir.
Hah?
Are you a rotten liar.
Humiliations galore!
Thank you for everything.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
You're amazing!
There's something I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
You're that smart?
Yes.
Morons.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Then make your choice.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Wait! This is Boomerang. This is Boomerang.
What are you saying?
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
"Honeymoon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Enough. It's better. Please, Lambchop, it's better. Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do. I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you? Say ooops and get out.
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Do the books! Do the books!
Yes, sir. Thank you.
I have hurt your feelings.
Good, what is it?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry. Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that? A handkerchief?
They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...
Help!
All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Yes, what?
What you were saying. Keep talking.
Assume away!
Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Exactly. And how long did it run?
What scheme?
I'm not going to jump on you!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do? What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay. I'm way over here. Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.
Okay ... Max! And you can call me Leo.
I already have. Come on.
Where would you like to eat?
Coney Island??
Right.
What kind now, Leo?
Everybody's a big shot. Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.
Maybe you're happy.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe. She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
No way out. No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Here. Buy bullets. Kill. Kill them all!
What???
They are? Have you ever eaten with one? Liebkind, go! Kill!
Max, I...
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
My play? You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
We swear it!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Yes. We would!
Franz, trust me. I promise I won't let you down.
Five o'clock. Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Always.
Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?
Plus to minus. Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on. Let's get going.
Do you need us?
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
Come on. We'd better hurry. We're late.
Call chauffeur. Get car.
Good. Good. We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.
Get car. Get car.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee. Can't produce playees without checkees.
Finder's keepers.
Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
We can't play today?
Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch me.
Thursday. I'll see you Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Oh, it's fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye. Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta. Ta.
Smasheroo. Smasheroo.
I solemnly swear...

Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Vat?
Yes. The actors. I must destroy the actors.
Okay.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois. But everybody calls me LSD.
What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
What do you do best?
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
No good, baby, no good. You heard my orders. Nobody retreats. Attack! Attack!
Who can we attack? They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels? Where's my little Joe?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Heil, baby! I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
We won.
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
How early?
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
Back where?
What do you mean?
How did she pay you?
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic! This ain't jelling.
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Let's all talk about Mary.
Who are you, friend?
What's your interest?
Why?
Must've needed it.
I don't know.
Casharoonie!
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Yes.
She stole some money.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.
Lila.
Is something wrong?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Here?
With you.
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
What should I know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
What thing?
Huh?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind... You men and your egos.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I ought to call the police right now!
She haven't even called you?
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
I feel better when you feel better.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.
Just wait here?
He didn't come back here?
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Without calling me?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Well?
Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I don't know where to start... Except at the beginning.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Watch your tenses.
Huh?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Sorry.
Hospital clean.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
Why not?
It's regular. Okay?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Can you?
I have to go, Sam.
I can come down next week.
No.
Sam! No!
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
You have a vacancy?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You have something most girls never have.
I've caused you some trouble.
Mother... ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You're very... kind.
You eat like a bird.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Uncommon, too.
Only my share.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
Except you.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss...
Crane.
That's it.
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Then I'm free to go...?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Please... I'd like to go...
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Why?
Oh?
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Maybe you saw Mary!
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
My mother is not dead!
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
You didn't find anything.
Did I?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Did you wish to see someone?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He's inherited a fortune.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
No-
Who are you? What is your name?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh
Maybe you're right.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Thousands?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
That's it. You get it quick.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
How do you do.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
What's that?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
What is it now?
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Your father?
Yes!
Did you hear?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
No?
You killed him! Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
Yes, why?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
But what about lunch?
I think so.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Let me go! Let me go!
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
What! What are you talking about?
The body of Joan Gale!
Are you giving me this straight?
What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
You mean he was colored?
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item? From a little bird?
Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
We'll grant that.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
That's what I said.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
It's all yours.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Fine, thanks.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Cry-baby?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
I see. Was that all she said?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
You go in for dangerous things.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
Good night, sir.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You're insane.
But I have some friends waiting.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Shall we unpack it?
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
Yep. Everything settled.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Two: what if I didn't miss?
You did.
What was her name?
Excuse me???
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
I'm heading out of town.
What?
Could you?
Where to?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
We flopped the first time out.
Could be.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Of what?
I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time.
I've been dreaming about this.
Then you get it. You'll understand.
Why?
Yes?
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I know, Mother.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Nobody.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
You better quit that.
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah.
You won't die, Rose.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Neither do I.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
The new girl is here.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's what she would say herself.
No, son, she is dead.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
I am ahead of you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Of course.
I think we both know her.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Turn up your hearing aid.
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Who doesn't have such thoughts? We'd better get going.
Well, she's back.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
She does look a little peaky.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
How is she?
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Who?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Is this ill right?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it's Billy.
Well, it was a silly question.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
What's the use, there ain't none.
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Mine.
Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I don't believe it.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but... Oh, nevermind, forget it.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Galley proof.
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Took your time gettin' here.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
What's the matter with him?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Let me tell him. Let him decide.
You're not gonna see him again.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Incestuous.
How much?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
And... ?
What and? That's what I got.
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
This is private property. This is breaking and entering!
What... ?
Kittle...
What do you want? I'm clean. I been clean a long time.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
I need the "when" and the "where."
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
You shouldn't litter.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento. Nothing special.
That wasn't my fault.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
I can work this.
No you can't.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
This is too fast. This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
We should slow down.
Jiminy Christmas.
I say, fuck 'em. Let's go.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
I'm just saying...
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Okay, we got... one, two... three... Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's them trying to kill us.
Clench your teeth.
Wh... what... ?!
That's sick.
What's the plan?
When you planning to cut back on that?
What?
Name one.
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons? Your bartender?
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
They... they shot me.
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
You don't smoke.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
It doesn't say that.
Hey...
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up. You'll cry later.
What the... ?! What was that for?
Follow me.
Where we going?
Okay. But, what changed our mind?
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing. We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up. We're police. How can we steal from ourselves?
You live like a pig.
Can't you say something nice once?
Don't talk like that. There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels? Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
It's noon straight up. Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
You can't be serious.
I... I think I can... clarify...
Don't bother. This behavior's gone on too long. You're suspended.
You fuckers... damn you! Why?! Why me!? Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
Yeah... great.
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Alright?
We got him.
Slow down.
"Go, go, go!" "Slow down." Make up your mind.
Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside. Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK! You almost got us all killed!
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
Get closer! Don't lose him!
What... ? Not you too?
He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
That's not true.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Dead.
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Come again... ?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.
Get his attention.
Hey-Ho... ! Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
What the hell's his problem?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You suck at lying, Archie.
We're screwed.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
I don't think so.
The gang's all here!
You see that?
Yeah.
You always did have style.
It's one of a kind.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't kill my own father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
As you wish.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
I don't know. Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Hey!
Someone who loves you.
Leia!
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
What's going on?
I...
I'm sorry.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good luck.
Here we go again.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
Good shot, Red Two.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
There it is!
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Ugh!
Oh!
What's he saying?
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
Come with me.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yoda, I must know.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Certainly not!
You!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
You promise you won't tell?
He might be. I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Janet.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Yes.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
Yes Brad.
I've got something to say.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
I'm coming with you.
Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this?
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
It's alright Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light.
No, don't do that.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You know this earth - this person.
Good God.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Well. I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
Promise you won't tell Brad.

I think you had better both come inside.
Are you - giving a party?
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them. They liked you.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...How's the turtle food this week?
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
...I don't know.
It's Thanksgiving.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I think it's closed.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
Would ya like a glass of water?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
Would ya take off your glasses?
What?
...T-thank you.
Do me another favor?

I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yes.
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
...And he called the reporters --
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Is everything all right?
...Can't do it.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
What're we going to do?

Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.

You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
...It's very American.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Fouls.
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
How was the flight, Champ?
Did ya get the license number?
Of wa?

She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.

Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Six!
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
That's ten bucks.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
How'd you know?
You think I don't hear things?
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No -- Just me.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
I'm sure you are.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey --
What?
Make your teeth yella --
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I won't.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...Did ya fight last night?

Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...No.
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Whatta' those?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I got pain an' experience too.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Yo, Benny.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
How am I doin'?
Real good.
Ya nose is broke.
...The guy's great.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
What kinda business?
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
Maybe ya better forget it.
...Maybe I better forget it.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Gazzo's a good man.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me? Please do me that favor.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
What can I do about it?
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
...People talk to me more.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you feel you have a chance?
I'll tear his head off.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
No. But neither does Roger. That's Diablo Red. Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Well, I'll be...
I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
So where is it then?
My hunch is it was Maroon. He always was after Acme's property.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Maroon, right?
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
They must've taken it off me.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No...
Does it hurt?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
So altruistic.
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
Hold on a second.
Now what?
What a gasser.
What the hell is that?
Doom.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
So what do you want me to do?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
Maroon? Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Valiant! You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake! Pattycake!
My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Does this help?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
Angelo? He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
A Toon? Noooo.
Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Safe?
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Two bits.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Yeah?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Have patience!
Leave Me!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out--
Of love?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Hold Daughter!
Good marrow, father!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
I take thee at thy word.
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
So thrive my soul--
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
I will follow you.
I thought all for the best.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Nurse.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
It's under your seat.
We kept it...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Well I don't!
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
Who the fuck are you?
I drive -- and my name is Larry. Larry from the States.
So what's the deal?
And you believed me? But it wasn't my people who did it.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
What in bloody hell is going on?
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam. I'm a weapons guy.
You were a soldier, were you?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I still am.
Is that right?
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.
I didn't say I was.
Are you alright?
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
We'll double your price.
Really? Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have it?
Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
I take it you still want the money...
Where's my information?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
A means to an end, is that it?
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Not exactly.
Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
American.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
You shoot alright.
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Yeah, well... My way works too.
What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.
What a surprise...
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
You should watch what you eat.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent. And I coordinate.
Coordinate what?
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to know.
How did you know?
Know what?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Not exactly.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
You know him?
The Irish representative?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Dark ops?
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
I know. Jean-Pierre did.
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
I don't know...
Give me a cigarette.
Right now?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Time to quit.
What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.
Because I don't walk away.
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
What happened to it?
Gone. Destroyed.
Gaelic.
You sure?
Why's that?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright. And you?
Doing well. This is?
Do you have the tape?
Can you get it?
Sort of!
Damn.
Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Cash and what?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Never heard of it.
Oh, you would have done great.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess. Why?
No. We can't.
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
What makes you so sure?
That's right!
All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then. I'll do it.
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!
I don't know...
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
What are you thinking?
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
...Or get rid of the money. I don't know.
He's going to be trouble.
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him!
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
Oh Jesus...
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
No. It stops now. It stops here.
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
Well, I don't know...
Two thousand...
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
What are you proposing?
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
Whoa, Earl!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
How are ya?
No. Why?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What for?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.
Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
You got me something? What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Nothing happened?
Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
You're worth every last penny.
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
So do I.
I love you Sally.
A satellite dish?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
I don't know. My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Be more specific. A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
Test the product?
Yeah.
I have a better plan. You want to hear it?
What?
And what's that?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What?
What is this? Don't be stupid man...
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
I guess we can get started.
That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Uh, no...
Maybe. Maybe not.
Why would someone do that?
Oh that was Agent Wallace. We're going to check into something.
Sheriff Hogan --
OK...this is good. Our first solid lead.
Yeah.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Anything...specific?
Sixty five... Jeez Louise!
Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on me.
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
No, I can't say that I have.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C? 32 C?
Sure.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Very clumsy, very clumsy. Id have found it in a minute.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
She's not his type.
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Uh, sure. I hear you.
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Something wrong, Jesse?
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
What?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
What are you saying?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that. You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
Dwayne please calm down!
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
I'm not asking.
Well you're not getting, either.
What do you mean? You gambled it?
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me.
You're never getting that much.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
How's work?
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
Well I don't know --
Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Anything in it?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.
There was more than that.
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
Yeah.
This isn't right...
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
What the hell is that?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Winner six!
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Invitation, please.
I'm with the band. I'm the lead singer.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
What?? Where'd you hear that?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
Is this about the funny money?
How you doing, baby? My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken.
San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
This is your ship?
Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called?
Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon? You sure about that?
Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Yeah, that's right.
We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
So what's your story?
I'm busy at the moment.
I said get on your feet!
Let's go. I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Oh, you American?
That's right.
You bring American money?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No. It's my first time.
Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
No.
Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I knew you were lying.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Hello.
What are you doing?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
What's wrong?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Carter?
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu? Never met him.
Not Yu. You!
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama. Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No. She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Good at what?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
It sounds impossible --
Why LA?
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic.
He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
No. It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Is it hot in here?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
No. It's not right.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What is it?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
Wait! There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Let me see it again?
She saved our lives.
Look, man I'm sorry. I know you got a thing for her.
Why did you help me?
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
Yes. We have heaven.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
Fine by me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken. Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
Hello, Benjamin.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle.
We're slowing down. This must be it.
End of the line.
You could never kick my ass. You mama's boy.
Red Dragon.
What is Mac out?
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
No. I'm going to find out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I did!
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
What?!?!
You go after Ricky. I got this.
Carter...
We made it, man.
That your gate down there?
Yes.
I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge? No way, man. I can't take this.
What is this?
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.
No, Carter. I can't take this.
They owe us, man. That's the least they can do.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Is this a payoff?
Put your arms around me.
What's going on?
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
How do I know I can trust you?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Are you okay?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Master Ching taught me.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
I know, Master, but...
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Who the hell is that?
Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Hey, that's whacked! I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
Feds asked for me?
Ooo, there's a chill. Love that.
He stole my wheel!
This is pathetic.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
Beach Boy.
You're shittin' me. You know the Beach Boys?!
You have one of these?
You speak English!
A little.
Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
What?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
It was not my intent --
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
What plate?
The license! You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Don't go there...
Stooly.
What?
You talk too fast.
Let's go. Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You like it?
Yeah, it's good.
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.
Yes, I think so.
No, no. It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll. Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off.
Good God, ya'll!
Are you OK?
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
What?!
Which one?
This is my territory now. You are my responsibility.
This concrete? This is still America.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
No, wait. I don't have it. You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
Oh no.
What?
Oh my god. Griffin.
No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
How'd what go?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You don't like it?
You OK?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
How about a lift home?
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hmmmm?
I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment.
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
I don't trust anybody. Especially first time deals.
I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
My daughter.
She's fine.
Hello.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Yes.
You have what I asked for?
He is very good.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ. My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I was trying to find the right time.
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
You don't understand this guy.
Yes.
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
Got any last minute advice?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Good one! Thanks.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
That's it. Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
Bob's in a hurry.
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes. I just believe they're listening to you.
Fully. I like her. She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
What?
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Of course we are. Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no. I just got one.
Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Good fact. Well, you let me know.
Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter. And you are?
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
I think you'd look good in red.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Yes, I am. And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Thank you.
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Originality is my speciality.
Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
You're going to be very disappointed.
Everest. Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
How romantic.
We think so.
Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
Always a mood killer.
Highly suspect.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
You don't know.
No.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
I'll have the same.
Of course.
Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Kind of isolated.
Where did you disappear to?
I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Yes.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.
It's fun! It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Lost!
No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'd rather not.
I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
I love you. I love you.
To who? Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
Used?
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
Reporter?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Good morning to you, too. You look good.
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
I'm going to kill myself.
Why?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
He's going to be the pastor?
Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?
Grandma!
He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming.
No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.
Let's go.
You okay? I'm closing.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Thank you. You still think that he was....
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Good boy, Port Hole.
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No. It's my life.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
No, no. You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?
You take the microwave?
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
It's not a boat boat. It's really a house.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
-- who's married to --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
They loved you. I told you they would love you and they did.
I love you.
I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Even when you were young?
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
And then I'll see you in New York --
What?
About forever.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
I do.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
-- it was a betrayal.
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
So what happened?
I told you. Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Oh!
What?
You should write something about this.
About what?
It's not true, but it feels true.
What was that about up there?
What was what?
What's with you?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible. A guy can't --
Can too.
No.
Yes.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Did you talk to him?
Okay. Good. Goodbye.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you. I love you.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
M.F.E.O.?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
Oh. Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No. Not remotely. I just want to find out about him.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Please --
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah. That's my dad. His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
I know. He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
You know.
What?
Magic. It was magic.
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
Sure you do.
Magic.
Hello.
It's you.
It's me?
Which means --
Grace heard it.
Hello.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
All righ...
Good. How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
Why not?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
It's not that late in Seattle.
You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
No.
Is he home right now?
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
When's the latest time you were out there?
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll like it.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah. What's that?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
I don't get it.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
Eighty dollars.
I have forty-two. So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
What is it?
It's a spice rack.
Dad? About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
Not.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
P. Dad?
What?
Fine. Fine.
So I can go.
Sure. Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I'm sorry. I'm just --
Stressed.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"-- What is that?
Oklahoma. Do you know where that is?
It doesn't. They ask you.
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad. Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
It was sinking.
What was?
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This one's for both of us.
Her name is Annie. Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger. Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Did you call that radio station again?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
God, she's beautiful.
Who is Annie?
Have you seen my wallet?
Are you going with her?
Fine. I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
This conversation is finished.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
When I found you?
If I didn't go.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What about camping?
What about it?
Sure. I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Well...
Hi.
Hi. Sam?
Yes?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
You're kidding --
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Hi.
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
I know her pretty well. Maybe I could call her --
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You're welcome to one.
No thanks.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Mornin'.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Well?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Jenkins ain't no boss. Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
How goes it?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
No, Estellita.
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
Where you going?
This water's cold again.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
What?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Never... never... never!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
I'm a fool.
Was it expensive, the beer?
Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
Let them take it!
Over my dead body.
No.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there. And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Can be what?
You all right?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Yes.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
A meeting?
I waited up till midnight.
Be still ...
Where are you going?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
But honey ...
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
Well, if that's possible ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
What are you doing here? Something wrong with Mama?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
Lus! Come down here!
Where's your mama?
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
What attitude?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
That's it?
Are you Australian?
No.
No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.
Bobby?
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
How about in the house?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Did you see his hair color?
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Yeah.
Everything go?
Yeah.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.
Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
Nothing.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Then leave.
I can't.
Why not?
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
Why don't you call the cops?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Oh. Hi.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
And you admire that?
Is that how you play?
: What are you up to?
Nothing.
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Ass first into the world.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
They would have killed you too.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
How you holding up?
Oh shit
Who is it?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
Twelve
Where to?
I know a guy.
Nice day
I hadn't noticed. I've seen you around. What's your name?
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
I'm hurting.
Sorry.
Don't get carried away.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear. Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
A quarter? Danny that ain't even worth ...
Fuuuuuck
Can your man handle that?
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Yeah, that's what I mean. Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Jimmy.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Danny?
Yes, Jimmy.
What's this?
Okay
Why?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
No one ever noticed?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Come on, guys ...
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Don't address me. I didn't make the accusation.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Shoot him.
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
No last name?
Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Danny, I'm touched.
You think I'm a Judas?
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
I was getting to it.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
This chink have a name?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
You've got no choice.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
Murder. Beautiful.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Yeah. What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's that smell?
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
Nervous?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
And you've got wiener breath.
Really?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
There's no motels around here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
We're in business.
Where's Bubba?
What is it, drugs?
What is that? Rum and coke?
Don't worry about it.
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Resistance?
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
The Army gave you that?
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Y'all come back.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Where?
In the shadow by those two trees.
Watching.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.
Not yet.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It was nothing.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
Pass.
I wasn't made for this.
It looks like a Renoir.
Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Some.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
Good luck, Captain.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
What about our grenades?
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Worked, didn't it?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
You? Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
Simpson.
Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade. Translators?
Fresh out.
You get a translator, Captain?
Hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
Got it, sir. We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me. Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
You think they'll be alright?
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Three for three.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Is it getting worse?
Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
How about...?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
You alright?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
What are we going to do?
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Trust me, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sure, Reiben.
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Ours is not to reason why.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Up. We're moving out.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. HERE WE COME. Cover me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Cocks his Thompson. Settles down behind some sandbags.
HERE THEY COME!
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Here they come.
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
Continues FIRING. CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Yes, sir.
Don't do that again.
You set? Sarge nods.
Is jumped on by one. Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Yes, Private.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
And Sarge?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Shit, sir.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Who cares?
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Frogs?
Lingerie.
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool. Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
So, where are you from?
We know.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back. Pissed off.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
Twenty-four-five.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here.
Understanding the following rights...
Speak with my lawyer.
This evening is over.
Hmmm. Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hi.
Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Keep it.
You're sure?
Lloyd?
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
No, no, don't go in there.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's unlikely.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
I'm gonna call her.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
Did you sleep with her?
So, what's your point?
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
What does it say?
No, you're not a guy.
I am.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
I don't feel anything.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
I told him to be himself.
Lloyd, it's us.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Wait a minute.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I just saw Joe. He's here.
Why?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can accept that.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Visit her at the home.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
What?
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Dad.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Which they did. Let me finish.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Bon voyage.
Do you love him?
'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, are you okay in there?
What happened to you?
Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
You think you know what this money is?
No, but you stole from them.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
Hello.
Hi.
Alright.
Thank-you. The real world.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing! Hello, Diane?
Thank you very much.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah. What a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Busy?
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Well...
No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Whoa.
Would you hold this for me?
What are these?
They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.
Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
He does this every year?
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
That's cool then.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Thanks. But either way it still feels...
Twisted?
You know what?
Basic. Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Job? Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah.
Nice one.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Me? Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
You have to meet Bess.
Okay.
She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yes.
What did you say?
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti- social.
Be friends?
Yeah. With potential.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Okay, this is important...
This is so noble.
Let's get outta here. You want to?
Are you comfortable?
Yes. Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
Check your mail tomorrow. I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh. It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What? This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
We'll see.
Okay. It's good knowing this.
Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
You do?
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
What?
I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
How's it going?
No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright.
It's your castle, man.
You're freaking out here man.
Yeah.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Jim Court?
Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
What?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is. Good luck.
Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye.
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you.
Fine Lloyd.
How ya doing? Is she around?
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call...
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know.
She's very successful.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
My car.
Diane Court.
Lloyd. Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
No way.
Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
I called her up.
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
Ooop, excuse me.
How you doin', brother?
It's gotta stay purple. All night. Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know Diane Court?
Oh, I was just going to...
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was gonna...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Certainly.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man
Give me my firebird keys!
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Itzhak Stern? He's on the list.
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
You know what, you'd like her.
Oskar, please -
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
What?
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
All right, okay, let's talk.
In Breslau.
We started without you.
They're not gone, they're here.
Scherner told me something else about you.
It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
You want these people.
Look -
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?
I just told you.
Where are the guards?
What's that?
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Hey, Poldek, how's it going? You know about the list? You're on it.
Of course I'm on it.
What do I got for you?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
That's great.
I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How many?
How you feeling, all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
What's wrong with it?
Good. How's it going?
What are you doing?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Thank you.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays.
What others?
That'd be fine.
Jews, yeah. Investors.
Pots and pans.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Don't ever do that to me again.
Christmas presents.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
What other point is -
I'll talk to him.
I think it's too late.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
You don't? I do. I see a difference.
I'll talk to you later.
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn't do enough.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
We know that, son.
I can do it, Captain.
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Stop it...
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else.
That's okay.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Where is everybody?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
That's too bad.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm inquisitive.
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Its over, Cotton.
You have a right to be angry.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Let us decide that.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
Why?
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
He seemed harmless.
Need some help, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Youre the one who got away.
And now, drum roll please...
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Just for you, Sid.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
Miss Weathers.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
I think you're all an act.
I know that.
Not good. How you doin?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
You broke my heart.
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
..and as lonely as I am...
They're roomates.
And Joel's pre-med.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Who is this?
Who are you?
That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
You're getting obvious.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.
Are you in danger now?
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
I dont know.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Don't do this.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
Time to change numbers again?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
That was good.
Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Can I come with her?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Her old boyfriend?
And white.
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
Hello?
Gale?
She's not here right now.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I hate scary movies.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Take it off.
But...
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Shush.
You ass.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I get scared really easy, okay.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back.
What was that?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Melinda McGraw?
Jesus. Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Thanks.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
More of a game really.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Where are you?
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Please, call me Gale.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you? Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Hmm.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Oh yeah, how?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Detective Kincaid?
What Rielly?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Yeah?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey. We tried, we're different.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
Off the record.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Jennifer needs me.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Stop following me.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
What?
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory!
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Do you want us to come with you?
Sidney, what happened?
What's your point?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Possibly.
Basements creep me out.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what? Hey.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
Um hmm... umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Huh, fine.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
Hello.
Who's this?
Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
What? What movie?
Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
W-what do you want?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Who is this?
Yes.
Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I didn't kill anybody.
Owwww...
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Ready?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Jesus, SHIT!
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
You know that's not true.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
So...
I wanna let go. I do...
Sshh... it's okay.
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
Are you serious?
Who did you call?
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Fuck you.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
Hello?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
Hello.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Hello.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
I have to go now.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
Yes?
I told you not to hang up on me.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
I'm getting scared.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
I wanna play a game.
No...
Then he dies. Right now.
NOOO!
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I don't know...
Come on, yes you do.
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
You tricked me...
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
What kind of lead?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
So is Dewey your real name?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Sidney's father?
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
What is she doing here?
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
Any word on my Dad?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
Yeah.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She's tough.
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Where is she?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the delay?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Has his story changed?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Why would she lie about it?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
You're evil.
Where do you get this shit?
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Besides -- "Takes a man to do something like that."
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
And what would be your motive?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
The official term is "psychotic".
Do you believe this shit?
No way.
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Thanks, Tatum.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Do you really think Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I don't know...
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.
That's mature.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
What am I? The beer wench?
Give it to me.
That's not necessary. You're in.
You don't. It goes to court now.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
What do you think?
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what? This victim...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?" It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
What are you talking about?
I heard.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.
How you feeling?
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Where was the girl?
What? What?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around. Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? What are you doing out here?
Put it down. Put it on the ground.
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
David... please...
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You know that's not true.
Murderers?
A woman...
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
Here he comes.
What the fuck is going on?
Somerset...
You just met me.
Not here.
I realize that.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
There's a bucket here.
What?
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
You think it was poison?
You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
Good.
Is that clear?
Same color and texture.
This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.
I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned.
It's too soon for him.
It's my wife.
Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.
How's that?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?" This is sick. "The Honeymooners?!"
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
He's preaching.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Forced what?
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
No witnesses of any kind?
This is the one thing.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
What?
Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!
He just may be nuts enough.
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
Does this make it with you?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
The fingerprints.
Yes. They were there... so, it must be.
Why would we?
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
It is Victor.
Listen to me. He's all about playing games.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
No.
We don't know for sure...
And so what?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
How much money do you have?
Well, that was money well spent.
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office. We've got pizza.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
It's not what you think it is.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
What are you going to say?
You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Wait... just wait.
It was him.
The hell I can't! We get in there and we can stop him.
We need a warrant.
Think about it...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You do your job...
Where's the victory?
You knew I'd say yes.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
No.
What is it?
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
Stay with him.
Wait!
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective! Now!
Tell me it's not true.
Put your gun down!!
Don't do this... please...
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
What?
Oh... um, William.
It smells good.
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.
I was close once. It just didn't happen.
How long have you lived here?
I don't know, with this case.
I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.
It's a hard place.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
You should look into private schools.
Crime of passion.
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
What, Ben?
Let's get along...
Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Another one, eh?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
No sir...pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You ain't goin'...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You can forget that... Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
He cometh forth like a...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
What good does that do?
You got any more orders, Captain?
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
I didn't give any order to fire!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
How many, would you say?
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
What in...?
Sir?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
JOINT action?
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...

Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, come on!
Nothing for you to see.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
You want us to fire a shot if...
You all right, Ethan?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
What you goin' to do?
Good night...Laurie...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...

Why?
Because she's my...my...
That don't make 'em kin...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Oh...
Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
But I just bought a good blanket.
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Think she means for us to follow?
I think maybe we oughta...
Ethan, quit it!
Nine... Ten!
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
Lemme alone...
Stay out here.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Was your niece about their age?
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Comancheros...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
Don't go takin' that stuff...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Finish your breakfast...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
She'd be about thirteen now...
We got two around that age...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Why else?
Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love me?
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Are you crazy? That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
What are you doing?
Is everything alright? Aren't you feeling well?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears.
I miss Tommi so much.
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.
Who was that?
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here. I suppose you like it here with us.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
It's just a feeling. Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Who's that?
What?
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess: Another short circuit?
Oh, Ellen. My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
How did you get me out of there?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Oh, Ellen! I've been wondering when you'd come. Why don't you step in.
Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him.
Hello. Can I help you?
Ellen Straub.
It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my wife?
Stop scaring people. Let's go. We need to be on our way.
You didn't tell her!
We should leave the past alone.
Peculiar? You mean, like back then?
Hammer?
Well, look here!
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Tenth floor.
Look at this. The lock is totally demolished.
Hey, my man! How's the masterpiece coming along?
And the title of this piece?
Ned I know I know
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You are a gentleman.
Oh what have I done?
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Really?
Do you know that house?
Thank you, my lady!
Lady?
What do you want, Kit?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait! Will you desist!
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Never!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We have no Juliet!
We will all be put in the clink.
Are you writing?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
How long has it been?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
A woman of property?
And your relations?
On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Yes, I saw it.
When?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
I have a wonderful new play!
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And his ears.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Of course not!
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter Almost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Oh, that.
So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No Juliet?!
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Do you know it?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised! Locked?
Who is she this time?!
She is always Aphrodite.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Nobody. The author.
Cut round him for now.
What? Who?
Romeo.
The one who came with your letter?
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
How will it?
Kit
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good title.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo is Italian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Out."
"Of love?"
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be good to her, my lord!
God bless you!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
When the Queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your mother, and your father
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
And--?
And I love poetry above all.
Your Majesty!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Master Shakespeare
Luck be with you, Sam. Sam ?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
" Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay me."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Like you, I found him not at home!
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
Who are you, master?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
My lady!
Who is there?
Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
I am.
I do not know how to undress a man.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
Oh, do not go
Oh, Will!
That's my line!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Will! What--?
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
An excellent beginning Let him be a duke. And your heroine?
Orsino good name
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
But all ends well.
How does it?
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Nor you for me.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady VIOLA.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
But why me?
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
I . . .
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
What of her bosom?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
You are on my ground.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
He made it clear.
Only on expenses.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
No.
You mean immoral.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
He's still here.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Finished.
But not quite.
Don't you worry about that.
Is this necessary?
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
You looking for me?
Looking for you? Yes.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Who?
Your friends.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Not at all.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Cover it?
Well?
But there's no --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
Well, is it?
What?
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Yes.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
What?
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
Did you know --
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
She hated you --
Well, she had problems --
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
You see, they don't really know me.
Have you seen Hugo?
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
So?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
What?
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
Are you all right?
No.
Will you calm down.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Later. But first -- him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
No.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
Alex.
What?
Are you all right?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Interesting.
I see.
So, uh...
What?
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
Can you afford this place?
What about?
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Two?
I see.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
I'm sorry.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Expecting anyone?
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
What do we do here, David?
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
What guy that died?
That one, last week.
Here?.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
It's nice.
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
No.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
The first one was fine.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
Offering it for debate.
You can tell by the intonation.
Your watch.
Is it real?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I thought you were in a good mood.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Do you think George is a fairy?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That's George.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Lester.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
We cannot go into this later.
That's okay too.
What are you talking about?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
What're you looking for?
My keys.
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
What?
She's got a...
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
Wow.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
-- What?
Nummers.
What?
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
George --
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What kind of treatment?
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
But aren't you...
Well she...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
... what?...
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Okay.
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
... yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.
Well, are you?
Am I what?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
Yeah, it is.
I never get my hair done.
No shit.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
No.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
I am not!
Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
Right now?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
I went to school with her husband.
Great.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
George!
Yeah.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
You're late, George.
What!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You do it.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
How long you had this?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
-- Well no. It never came up.
You going to tell him?
Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
Where do you want to do this?
Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
She's incredible... She loves you, George.
... I don't get it done often.
Whew.
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No.
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?
And what?
It was after you, baby. After you.
George...
George... how about Felicia?
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah?
Baby...
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
George...
Yeah, baby...
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
What are you talking about?
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- don't you want to --
Jackie, can we --
-- you are.
-- gee...
-- what?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
That sounds like me.
Where do you want to go?
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
What are you looking at?
-- yeah.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- sure.
-- where'd you go?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- yes, you --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- Jesus --
-- good afternoon --
I've got to leave?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Why?
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- It's Malone's.
You're going to kill me.
No --
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So I'm saying it...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
God, there's Lester...
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
Wanda...
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Yeah!
Wash her.
What with?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- White ladies?
Otis is dead.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Not yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Call me!
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone.
Well, like what?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George, I don't --
George --
Keep moving --
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
Fine. How are you?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Honey?
Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?
We live together now.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay... Night, baby.
George?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Great.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Yeah.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Go where?
Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
George.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
When?
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Neither do I, baby.
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Jill says nothing.
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
Now, Jackie --
I've got to get her out of here.
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what? -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight, George.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
That was him.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously.
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
Baby, don't do this --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... well I'm glad you told me.
What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
I wish you'd go now.
That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George...
Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
What're you here for?
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
In a way. But...
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
Thank you.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
When?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
... she's very upset...
What about, tonight?
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
I don't know what to...
-- yeah?
Well anyway...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
You live like a pig.
Yeah. How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Want a drink?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
I know.
Who?
Me!
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Yes I do.
What?
What took you so long?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
Come on by.
You're home.
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Well maybe I can get you something.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
You do?
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
George is going to open a shop.
I am?
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
Of course not.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
Aren't you going to have one?
No.
Why not?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
Hi, Leonard.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Poster-Kleiser.
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Who is that?
I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Don't be silly.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
He does?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
What?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Egypt?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Johnny!
I'm terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
That bastard.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
You're kidding.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
What's wrong?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Jill.
-- yes, Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
You seem disappointed.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
Call me Les.
Where to, Les?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Yes?
I'm hungry.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You mean they ate each other up?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
How's it going, Doc?
Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad. Dad?
Yes.
No. I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't. I have too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?
Dad?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Yes.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
No I ain't.
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I guess so.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.
Jack...
Yeah.
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win. Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Okay...oh!
Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Oh what a Maze. Isn't it beautiful.
It's so pretty.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mom?
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Well all right. But really don't make a sound.
Danny?
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Danny. Danny, stop it. Danny!
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
Oh,
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Do I have to?
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir. It tends to stain.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Good evening. Forest Service.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you?
Thank you very much. I'll do that.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Sure.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
I'm a Wendy.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
Beg pardon?
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks.
Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Perfect for a child.
Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Any ideas yet?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
It's okay. It's okay, now. Really.
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack!
I...
I can't really remember.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me! Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Very nice to meet you.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
Only in a very general way.
five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
Not for me.
They'll love it.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
I'd better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Royalty?
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Fine.
What time does the plane leave?
Eight thirty.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
What's the money for?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Yes. Go away.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
For getting a divorce?
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Mom-!
You all right, Marty?
No.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Huh?
Don't call me dear boy.
What?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Sure.
Yeah... sure.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
You want to know what I think?
I told you!
There! You see!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
But Uncle Al! You said-
What if I say no?
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Really.
What about crack? You a user?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
But how?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy. He's...
Yes, Mary?
SING!
Were you tempted?
But I'm fearful!
SING!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
How come? Sister?
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
What you do?
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
What?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What?
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
What?
No... it's fine.
Yes?
Thanks. A lot.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my!
What is it, Betty?
Look at that. Get a gander.
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
Where did that come from?
Just about. Show me again.
Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
Hold on.
That machine.
I know. It's ancient.
Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
What?
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
Shirelles.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?
I knew that.
Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.
Wet behind the ears.
It'll be hell.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
She's a pro.
Van Cartier.
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
What? What time is it?
It's after five. We have to bathe.
What?
I... I brought you something.
Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years. Sister.
Three years. A rookie.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
Mary Clarence!
Bobs
Experience! Right?
I have to do this. So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
Run! Take off!
But what do they want? Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
It's true!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
Your name?
Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
St. Anne's?
Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
What?
It has come to pass.
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
No problem.
The vow of obedience.
And the vow of chastity.
Silence? No talking? All day?
No food?
Is this all the food I get?
Yes. Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
My what?
Useless distractions.
It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
I got it.
In English?
Really catching on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
So... hi there.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I am?
No. No.
I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But... wait a minute...
You sent for me?
Really. Well, that makes two of us.
But -- why?
But...
What are you doing here?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang.
He's a businessman.
Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
He didn't do you a favor.
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
Okay -- no limo.
No nothing.
I hate you. I totally hate you.
I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.
Jesus, look at you You're glowing.
I am?
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
Really? Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Me too.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
I've got to go.
Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
What?
I think they'd understand.
What're you doing?
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hey, girls.
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
Really.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Then one day they find you.
Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
Where's who?
You won't even tell us?
We're looking for Mike.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But you didn't tell me!
We didn't tell you what?
A nun?
Vince -- is she... okay?
And if she runs?
He's so damn cocky. This is different.
It's done?
Not... totally.
Well?
It didn't work, Vince.
Right.
Get her!
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She's gettin' away!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
You didn't shoot!
Neither did you!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
A sweater.
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
Peace on Earth.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
We did it! We actually sang a chord!
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence! Sister!
We can't sing without her! What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
It's so beautiful...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Not a note.
I don't understand. Where is she?
She said they were from her old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
I lied.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
She's... she's a nun.
We both missed.
Where?
If we could speak alone.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Many have.
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable. How are you?
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
What the hell are you doing?
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
They spend two days in chains.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
We must be a curious sight to him.
What are you spying on?
He is a behemoth.
Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you.
... Brom Bones...
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.
It is sacrilege!
I will not allow it. I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!
Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm? See them?
May we look at them now?
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
I shall, gladly.
The Widow Windsor.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
... found the body this morning. You do believe now, don't you?
Listen to what you say....
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I am not here for revenge. I am here to bring justice.
Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Where are we going?
Out there. What do you see?
The Western Woods.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What kind of nuts?
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
Thank you.
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
Listen.
I hear nothing.
We are leaving.
We should not go much further in this murk.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?
What is it?
Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.
In test... what?
Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried. Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
What now?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Small talk.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You do not disturb me. Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars. How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.
He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...
Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?
Thank you. No. Here...
I insist that you have it.
You promised justice.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
They have done nothing of the sort.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...
And this gives worth to butchery?
To avenge his father, and the others.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother? Is she still alive?
It is only me.
Katrina. Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
What are you doing?
My God... what has happened?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
The skull is gone.
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
And, what did he say?
He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.
Where are we going?
The church.
What was that?
Ichabod...
Quickly, close it.
I... I can't do this.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
No. She has gone out.
It appears well. It has already clotted.
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
I know you saw me.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible...
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?
You are from the Hollow?
I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and back.
The Horseman. Yes.
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.
You... you are alive.
He rides tonight.
Go home.
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Yeah, they's good all right.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
How are you, Bill?
Can I see him?
I'll see you, Bill.
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Did you decide, sir?
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
French-fried potaters.
Yeah.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what, by God?
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
You got that shit right.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's in your bag?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Why? Hi, Karl.
But maybe just for awhile --
What's you last name?
Childers.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
They let you out?
Yeah.
How come?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You want to go with me?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
All right then.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
It was alive?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
It was still alive when you buried it?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
You will? For sure?
Yeah.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
You don't want to give away all your books.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
I've got a feelin' today.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know. You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
You all right, Mama?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Did Vaughan go home?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know he does.
Mama?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
You walk fast, don't you?
A blister shore can hurt.
Yeah.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I reckon.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Karl, you up?
Yes sir.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?
Yes ma'am.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
He just got out of the state hospital.
What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Do you smell shit?
Let's just go, Marsha.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Will that be cash or charge?
Better make it charge.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Melville, huh? It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
I'd love to.
And what about for you?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me? I'll have the same thing.
Do me a favor, will you?
What's the difference?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Are you closed?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's kind of overwhelming.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Hey, man, good to see you.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
She probably died.
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Eighteen and a half years.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
It means "happiness."
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Where to?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Bully for you.
What's this?
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I almost got married once.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A little. Not much.
It's for you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp. It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Does it hurt?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And how much are these?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
Fifty-six. That girl had on a corset.
And these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
What does that mean?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
I just want to know where he is.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.
You going to sit here all day?
It was just a thought.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Five dollars an hour? I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Yeah? And why is that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off. You saved my life.
I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
Good. Lemonade it is. I'm Paul.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
That's where the what comes in.
Here and there. Around.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Is your father an artist?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
How long have you been here?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
You don't have to apologize. The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Hey, it's you.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Why don't you go to the police?
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks.
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hi, kid.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right?
How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres. I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Bits of blood and wood. What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I don't know.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Is that your third question?
It is.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
We discussed that. And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
My mom. Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her.
I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...
Did you write that column?
I did. But the jury won't s...
You don't believe in God anymore.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side.
Greedy.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
That's curious. I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir? Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Robbed. He was angry.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
You have the night watch? On the radio.
How long you have this detail?
I did. Boy.
You said three minutes.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too. But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Your daddy. Was quite a feller.
That's when he fell.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong. He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
We don't let go, you s...
What for, Sheriff?
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
What makes you think I play?
White or black?
You must think I like losing.
You wouldn't even see it move.
You want me to say that.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Does it now?
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.
No.
I don't think so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
Is it possible?
For certain, no.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Are you absol...
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Yes. And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Bye.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Beat it, Buster.
Yes, Sue? What is it?
I beg your pardon.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
A what?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Okay.
- so the one-legged jockey said -
What did he say?
Cut it out, girls. Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Same faces - same instruments - - and here's your Valentine's card.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Hey, Joe!
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Sam the Bookie? Nothing doing! You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Right. We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I think they got me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
You going to call the police?
The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
And it's so drafty. They must be catching colds all the time.
Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked. Like everybody's looking at me.
It's no use. We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
DAPHNE?
Hello, everybody. I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
How about that talent? This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
This way, Daphne.
I changed it. It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Bye, Sugar. We been playing with the wrong bands.
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
Steady, boy. Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Fight it.
But suppose I lose? Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here? Daphne - Daphne -
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
Blow where?
How can we? We're broke.
What are you talking about? Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah - let her soak. Come on.
What is it, young lady? What are you staring at?
You - you -
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
Fat chance! You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not. I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No. I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers! How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry! You can't be serious!
Security.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what?
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
That's some nerve!
Joe -
Shut up and keep packing.
Not that, you idiot.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
Telephone call? Who's got time for that?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Hello, my dearest darling. So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk. And if we have to, we'll starve.
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope? But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed! Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
OH!
That's us. I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
Oh - Sugar!
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
You got some?
You all right?
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh. Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
Here you are, Sugar.
See? She doesn't have one either - You don't?
What do you think you're doing?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
His yacht?
It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - ! How about that guy?
Yeah - Josephine.
We don't have to run.
Josephine -
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny. Josie - I can't imagine where she can be.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I hope so.
No!
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones -
Brand new.
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes. For a whole year.
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
Just a moment, miss - May I?
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Me too. Bye now.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
Yes, indeed. It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You invest in shows?
No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
You're not sure?
Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Why?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Please. It won't happen again.
Well, I'll be - ! He does have a bicycle.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Pleased to meet you.
Another bridesmaid?
Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
It doesn't matter.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand! I'm a MAN!
Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
Anything today?
Oh, it's you! You got a lot of nerve -
Oh?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
What's the job?
Why?
And you'll be in all evening?
Yes, Joe.
Good! Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape? You looking for hunchbacks or something?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No - funerals.
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
Running away? From what?
Put it here.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Then why did you take this job?
Afford it?
Have you ever been with a male band?
Rough?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
Bingo?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
That so?
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
What's in Florida?
Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.
You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah. With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I want mine to wear glasses.
Happy days.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear. You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne. You haven't got a bathing suit.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Well, don't worry. I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
That must be it.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Your view of what?
I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.
Could be. Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele. And I sing.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Yeah. Real hot.
- Inauguration balls -
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
You're very kind. I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Josephine.
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I am?
Well, you know how those millionaires are. These came for you.
Been waiting long?
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Just regulation size. We have three like this.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Champagne?
I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Look at all that silverware.
Trophies. You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
You're flattering me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have you tried?
See? Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Is that anything?
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it. Relax.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Well - ?
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Mineral baths - now really!
Good night.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, no. I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Really?
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful. Poor Josephine.
Yes. Now about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.
A merger? How long will you be gone?
Oh, of course. I understand. At least, I think I do.
What's the matter, Sugar?
Sugar! What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
PLEASE!
What'll it be, sir?
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Big joke. Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella? Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Big joke!
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me? I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name? And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street? Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
Hi, Spats. We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
What for?
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.
What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Too bad, Charlie. You would have had three eights. Goodbye, Charlie!
You know what I love about all this?
Perfect. All ginny.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I dont think I can go through with this.
I should get going.
Are you sure youre okay?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
What for?
It was such a long time ago.
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Huh?
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Um, just about everyone.
I thought you said you were crap.
I had to say something to get you here.
Ill just check into a hotel.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Whats his problem?
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, man.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Seeing you again....
Hey, Kat.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
That was a long time ago.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Youre not even listening.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
What color are my shoes?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
Who are they?
What?
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Would you grab my shampoo?
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Yes.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I guess so.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Subtle?
Its hard to explain.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
But nothing did.
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
You have more than one gynecologist?
You didnt have to do that.
Whats he do anyway?
Like fifteen.
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back. Good morning.
So whyd you let him go?
Its complicated, Dad.
Yeah.
Not yet...
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I always wondered what happened with us.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a water-back.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder. That feels better.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Uh huh...
That does it...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
And you say all them people is dead now?
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Colored.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
What he talk 'bout?
What about Sounder?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes mam...
Nothin'...
And so you did your job, right?
Yes, mam...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
What do that mean?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You would do that, wouldn't you?
It's cold, Daddy!
It was too dark, Daddy.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
David Lee...
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
Mornin', son...
Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
From Miss Johnson --
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's that, son?
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?
Sunday...
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Miss Boatwright --
Yes, David...
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David!
What's in there, David!?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
I don't look like no possum!
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
That's right!
Ready to go, Mama!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
'Bye, Mama...
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
What is it, David Lee?
Poor creature...
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night, Mama...
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
What's wrong, Nathan?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright!
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Come, I'll take you home.
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?

That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.

Night, son!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
Good mornin', Nathan.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
How's the weather out there?
Little chilly.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
Well, let's get to work!
Is there something I can do to help you?
Where you goin'!?
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wanta see Nathan.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What...
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
My head hurts.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Notice that nothing happens. Now say 'Montana.'
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.

You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Ze alarms! Zey went off!

How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Suck my balls.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
I can't believe he's dead.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass- OW!!!

You've got a stupid accent too.

Help yourself prickfuck!
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh yeah.
What was that word, young man!?
Oh, he said rim job. It's when someone licks your ass for-
Kyle?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
I don't know.
What's going on, Chef?
Hello there, children!!
Hey, Chef.
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Who are you, kid?
Viva la Resistance.
Oh no, it's that kid.
May I?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Purpre mama!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!

Who is it?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
SHIT!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Yeah, I guess.
Do you see them? Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a butfor?
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
We can't leave without you!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
That was sweet!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nowhere.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
What? What don't I get? What don't I get?
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Whoa! What the hell was that?!
This is sweet!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
WHAT?
Thank you, Kenny.
Oh dear God...
Shiteater-
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE! I AM SATAN!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt. Geez Louise.
SILENCE!!! NOW!!! EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
No, it was worse than that...
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
We must take action on this immediately.
Article 42! You don't mean-?!
Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
But I-
How is the children's progress?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip! Cheers.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! You are a bad man!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip. This cannot be good.
What's going on Terrance?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
Yeah! YEAH!!! Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You know I do.
I know.
What did you do today Satan?
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Can we talk about this later? Everyone is watching!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
What is it?
You don't have watches?
Got it.
And ze rope?
Check.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
It can't be.
Excuse me?
Uh, yes I am. And you are?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
Of course, of course...
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Where the hell did you come from?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
There is a high level...of passenger dissatisfaction.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
What did you say to me?
It's a little late for you to be up.
All too well, captain.
No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed. Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
I think I can handle it.
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Bridge! Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed.
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
Idiot...
Barnes?
That's me.
Oh you'll get it, believe me. So I'll see you in a few.
It's time we lock coordinates.
So, what are we waiting for?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Is that clear?
Sheesh! Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No. But it buys a lot of other things.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Really?
What are we going to do?
We don't.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
Yeah. We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Taylor?
Yeah?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Do you want some advice?
Dawn! Dawn!
Oh my God. What happened?
What's that?
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
A flare? A flare won't do it.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I'm not going with you.
But how are you going to escape?
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
I will once I get past the bulkhead. Good luck.
Dawn. Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation. Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room! Let's go!
What do you mean? What happened!
So close...
I never thought this would happen. No premonitions, nothing.
It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that.
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
In that case, I accept.
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Where's Taylor?
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
I'm homesick.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Well now what are we gonna do!
It's getting too cold in here. I can't stand this anymore!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
You a mini-golfer?
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Heh, heh, heh.
Sorry about your loss.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Three whips. To go.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
La da da dalala...
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You know, Elvis bowled.
No kiddin'.
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Think he bought it?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
What's on your mind, Miles?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Buzz Fazeli.
Theo.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Need some advice, huh.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years!
That game was before you was born.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Theo.
It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.
What the fuck is this?
What's it look like to you?
I'm your blood.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I'm getting to like it here.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
I gotta survive.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
You got a better offer?
No...
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I never saw you.
He's the guy Buzz.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
My poor baby!
Hello?
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Don't tell me, John.
Cool!
I don't like to talk about it.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
You shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior who?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
Nice set-up.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What ever happened to just bowling?
How Mr. Kastle?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Why would you help me?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Look who's talking!
Fantastic! What talent.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Line up where you want it.
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know? Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it? The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
What do you want with my dad?
Business.
Won't your father help you with that?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
No, I'm fascinated.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Sheila, please.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
What are you going to do about your brother?
You're here.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Nope, I couldn't care less.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Nothing.
Too late for what, Sheila?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
You got any broken bones?
I can't tell you, Theo.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it. He's my brother.
You told Junior that we did it.
How do you get this thing down?
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
What about plan C?
Fuck plan C!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Sez you!
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Let me out, Captain. Open the door!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher? What are you doing out there?
They're warm. I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, get away from there...
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher! Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Hold on --
What is it?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Norman!
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nobody move.
But she's --
I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Direction's east coming!
What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
Where is it?
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't do it!
Norman, please! Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
Come with me. The team's already waiting.
What have you been told so far?
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters? Any press?
From what? What's with all the security?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so.
Then why am I here?
What?
What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Geologists?
-- Wait a second --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
What team?
They pressurize us with helium.
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something? What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know. That's the point.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing. He's gone. He left.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
Edmunds?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Damn it, Edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
Going active.
What the hell? It shut us down.
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Yes, sir. I'm here.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
It's not sucking, sir.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there. I thought I told you people --
Subs are still at surface, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
They've left, keep watching!
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here. I need you for this.
How much damage?
It's chipped.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I did.
Ted? Captain?
Yes, Harry.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
What?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
So how do we get it open?
So? What's the problem?
Gimme a report, I want --
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
What's the message?
I have to tell you. It's strange.
Ignorant. The thing's ignorant.
What?
With an "o". Harold with an "o".
She's not gonna know.
A half a mile long?
I'd also like it noted --
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
Radiation shield, you think?
What's wrong?
We had considered it.
But what does it do? This... sphere.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
How can he be missing?
Sir, about leaving --
They switched us over.
To what?
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Edmunds?
What is that?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
It won't register. It's too big to image.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft. To investigate.
Underwater?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
You're next, Norman.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
The library.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
What?
You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, why?
What? Why...
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't. Which is it?
What?... Wait. Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mean...
I can't feel her bones. She's like a sponge.
She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Norman.
What are they?
So what?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Calm down, Beth. Alright?
You said something to him, didn't you?
What?
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.
Beth --
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
Maybe you should go. To the sub.
Why should I go?
You should know how it works. Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would. But my suit --
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you. You see it?
I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit? Beth?
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear?
... what do you mean? I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me.
You get it straightened out?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it.
Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
You think?
You don't believe me.
Page 87.
What?
He translated it wrong.
You think, in the sphere --
He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things.
But how?
I don't know.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real.
Looks like some sort of code.
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Riordan?
Antihistamine. For bites.
Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
It's an idea.
Beth --
To be on the safe side. I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
I'm sorry.
For what?
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?
The sphere looks different.
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Your watch.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
It's getting cold.
You think I'd really drink that?
How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Did you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Beth you're losing it. C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You're insane.
Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
That's bullshit.
Is it?
Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
Don't, Beth. Please.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman. You can't fight me.
I know. You're too strong, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I --
Don't tell me about me. I already know too much.
C'mon --
Top shelf, is it?
What is that? What are you doing?
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Would it work?
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
Pussy.
No. I don't think so.
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
I don't get it.
Well, what's your theory?
Norman? Where's Norman?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who? The fish?
It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
Then what is it?
I never said that.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
In time for what?
What?
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what? I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not. I'm not star--
We can refuse to talk.
When did it come across?
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
How are you feeling, Norman?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine. I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
Go ahead. Ladies first.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
To what?
This answers one of our questions.
Not a clue.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Am I?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No. I didn't say that.
What is that? That noise?
What noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Norman?
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming.
Getting anywhere with those?
Did I?
... you there? Norman?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
What do you mean? She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
She's cracking, Norman.
But why would she -- ?
Wisconsin's your answer.
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
That's right.
What is it?
It's the squid! Stop it!
Did I kill her?
I don't think so.
Fine.
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
Missed.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry?
You know how to work this thing?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
There is one possibility.
You mean forget?
What'd you say to him?
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What does Norman already know?
She told me what you said, Norman.
What is it, Harry?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like. You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
English?
You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious.
But it's impossible.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please. It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived? From where?
Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent.
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
Norman Johnson.
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No other equipment? Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists? At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
You want me to try?
Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What kind of a crash was it?
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all. Honey --
In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Four. Four years --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.
What?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
Well, we'll see...
Well, I've brought you here. What now?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
You have your father's style. You've done very well.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures? I don't like it.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why. I don't believe we've ever met.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer. I'm not even a startrooper.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families. How can they hold her?
What's wrong? What's happening?
What is it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
You mean we should go after her!...
I can't see! How can I fight?
Try to feel it. Use the Force...
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it. You'll get it.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
We don't get many visitors. Let's take a look at it.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Who's the pilot?
You don't believe in the Force?
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...
Well, I practice a lot...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
Watch it! Move back.
Get to the ship!
They must be shielded somehow. I'm sure the base is there.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed. Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
What is it? What's going on? Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
Let him have it. You're winning anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187. She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
Holy Maker, Threepio. I forgot...
What an honor...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
It's what I deserve.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
What's the hurry ?
Did you read her mind ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
I don't believe it !
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Johnny, this is Zander.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So ?
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Where are you going ?
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Eeuch !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
You can't walk me home.
Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Are you the boy for me ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You talk to Carl ?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Do you mean it ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
That was just a mix up.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Which way ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Where'd it come from ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
A lot can happen in three minutes.
What ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Well, see ya.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
Way to go, amigo !
C'mon...
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Hey, Diz...
Diz, see what you can do.
What frequency ?
All bands.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
No, sir.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Courage, I guess.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Mister Rasczak ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir !
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Hit your jets, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Who is V'ger?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
<U>Answer</U>!
Yes.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
What does that mean?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
By the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Departure angle on viewer.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You are what...?
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
Programming ready?
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain, what's the next move?
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.
Hello, Ilia.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...! Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Time to impact...?
Twelve seconds...!
Mr. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Hold station...!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
We're losing the pattern...!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
They had a pattern to follow...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
What should you have known?
What answers?
Child...!?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will not be triggered for twenty-two minutes...
The point...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
To you, sir?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Evening, Annie.
Cal...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Nope.
Then you'll be wet.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
Northern Books. What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Other one has history, too. I wrote my play on it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent.
I quit.
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words.
You like my play.
Yes.
Why?
It's about life.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
I...
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
You get what you pay for.
That's true. You grow up here?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance. But...do you see?
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Well. It was a pleasure meeting you.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
No, no. Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
I live there.
Really. With the porch swing and everything...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...such a pleasant sound.
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Yes...
...who...?
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...
Hi.
What are you doing? I love your script.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
You're still here.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Hello.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart. I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You like kids?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too. You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
Great. Who is it...?
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl... Just leave it outside.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
Hi.
Thank you.
Read the card.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
The other side.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Why?
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
But it's absurd.
So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Sure did.
Why?
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
Ah. Ah. Ah...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality. That he...
...yes.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Going home, yeah. I told them what you said...
What?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Yessuh. Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Is it...
How's your star?
Gosh, you look nice.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
It does?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop. You know <u>why</u>...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What is it all about?
What am I gonna do?
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
S'Okay, Maude. You know your lines...?
Water or mineral deposits.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
What, what what are you doing here?
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
Hi!
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
It's all over between us. I've found someone else.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
No. Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
That a fact. Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is. It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Mornin', Doc...
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Well, where do they hold court?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
...they run on water.
How big is this horse?
Fifteen hands.
What is that in fingers...? Just kidding, get me this horse.
This horse is booked.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill? Hey, Bob.
Hey, Tommy. Heard your wife's having a baby.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Then she wasn't in the car. <u>Say</u> it.
...upset and impressionable... Get me the Mayor...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I never touched her. My mother's gr...
Stay ready. Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bobby, don't say anything.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
Mornin, sister.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I'm pretty impolite. Would you like some?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Are you all right...?
I...
Her...
What else?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>. ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures. What I'm saying...
She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
What I...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
<u>Bobby</u>...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I've always seen that.
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You do...?
You guys had better leave us a...
I'm very sorry to...
Well. What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um. You have a valid drivers license...?
Of course he...

I've got scene <u>twelve</u>... Shouldn't you be in school...?
It's night.
Aren't you ever in school?
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
Thank you.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I think he's moved...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
No.
It's a mistake. It's all over. I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
You can't treat me like this. I'm not a child!
She's absolutely r...
Matzoh! Are you Jewish?
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
Look.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...

But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
You have to hide.

Claire, when did you...
I just...
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yes, yes, but...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
I know that...
I know that, Claire. I, we <u>all</u> know...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>. I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I...I...
What?
Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
...I know...I know...
...and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows...
Wally...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I...
An artist of your caliber...
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
Hello.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
That's cor...
He's staying here? Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
I can't tell.
Why not?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Kiss my ass.
What?
Who got their heads cut?
Uh. Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...? What's the trouble...?
Main Street.
I have to talk to you.
Doug...
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape? Okay. Of whom?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
And I've got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him. Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
Hi.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
What's in the case?
And what was it you wanted to say?
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm. You have children?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You should.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Who's White...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I'm very sorry I...
I have to talk to you. My wife...
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
Does it have to be an Old Mill? Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire. I was at the Old Location.
We're out of money.
I can't write it. I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Grace...
Hey, Joe...Good. You know B...
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
What's the...
I can't.
Why?
I hurt my finger.
I'm gonna nail it.
Let's speak English. You've got to help the side.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal. Sup to you...
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
For what cause?
<u>Siddown</u>!
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
You can't write it?
How do they know that, you told them?
No.
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...? I saw it. I was there.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What glasses were you wearing? Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
<u>Stop</u>...
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
Do something.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Where the hell have you been...? It's...
I've got two days to get this house...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I signed the permit. I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<u>Whatever</u> you need. The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...it is?
I <u>am</u> the City Council. We meet Friday, and I...
You hear that?
...the damn thing...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
She coulda done better than him.
It takes all kinds.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part. Did pretty good too.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Zat true?
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Ben! What's wrong?
So what's up? Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Mass hysteria.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Like who?
It just slipped out.
It happens.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
That will never happen.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
How would you know sh...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
...why do you think?
So why are you asking me?
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But we do have a choice. To make it better. Instead of worse.
That happens. To families.
Wow. Who's that for?
I hope it's the right kind.
Like a big sister.
Actually. She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
And don't tell her I told you.
I can't hear you.
I said...
He wouldn't know. <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I could help with the debate.
Great.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Not with my mouth open.
And what do you do wh...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
This'll work, huh?
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom? What's wrong?
I don't want to say goodbye.
Thank God. I got to see you. Grown up.
I'm not.
Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going.
Yes.
I'll miss you so much.
You lost Ben?!
No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter.
Here.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi...
I don't have to listen to you! You're not my mother.
This is my daddy's house --
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom?
What if he's kidnapped?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
She still packing for her trip?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother. So why don't you say hello.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her. What you're going to say.
Not use my words, please!
Help me here...
Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not.
Great. Big ears, too?
In high school.
Ice cold water.
I hate her. I really hate her.
There you are!
No they're not.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
No.
No! Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
You touched it.
Then have a donut --
No.
Excuse me --
I made you some cocoa. See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IS THAT YOU?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. <u>Hate</u>.
I have lava.
Queen of diamonds.
Poof! You're happy now.
Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
That I do. Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
So you're okay.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
That's Rache's song!
No! I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Before you.
Ben. God doesn't like visitors.
How do you know?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay. These are good.
Find the bird cage?
Rache says it's from you.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
But you can still see him.
The world. <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone. But only the magician. Knows better.
Right here. Right here. <u>Inside</u> the magician. Shhhh.
It's not good enough.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
People beat it, don't they? All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
I'm here.
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
Napalm.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her.
I'll call from work. We can have a conference call.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I'm worried.
Easy enough.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Not to me.
Jackie stop. We promised we never go there.
Called him. We set an ap...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
To make it easier for them or you?
We...
WE are over.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
It's temporary.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you.
We're going to win this.
What happens next?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
What happened with Annabelle? Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What did you do?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
Machines do not EAT message.
Look, I...
Yeh?
...in.
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I have a snoop.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
She already hates me. You've seen to that.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
So why did y...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
I'm sorry, I just...
Hey. At least it's not an editing machine.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Anxiety.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
Yes?
You feeling all right?
...thinking of going back to Random House. On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki...
My boss.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You WHAT?
Look, you've never liked me...
Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Nobody likes a snoop.
Did I hear the word...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
You bet you are.
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Small world.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
You're a cross-dresser.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Moi?
She's devastated.
And you said...?
Can I look at the pictures?
So. Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless. A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
My advice to you? Don't die.
And her...?
Is that what he told you?
Looks nice enough to m...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?
Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
You weren't passing 'em out.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some <u>real</u> growth.
Oh please.
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
What's this about? Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're lying.
Why didn't I?
With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.
What do I have that you don't?
Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
The way you cook. If you could make love, I'd marry you.
We have to talk.
Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
So I'll have to order in?
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
For what?
You don't need to. I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
I trust you of course I do but --
But? But what?
Look. I know they hate me.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Get ready. To get <u>really</u> mad.
Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Not yet.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
We have the kids. Next weekend.
And it's <u>my</u> call. I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Rache, get out of th...
Oh my God. Are you serious?
I think so...What do you think?
It's forever you know.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Everything's gonna work out. The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Rache, it may take time.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
They're my kids.
She's not gonna die.
No problem.
What a great surpri...
Well, they will be.
She called it a fight. <u>The</u> fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
That's not us.
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Does Jackie know this?
No. I'm doing it behind her back.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Out! Leave the table!
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
What?
There are some rumors...
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Really? How many?
I did not go to high school.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
No, Mikey.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
No.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesus mi jesus
Speak English.
My Jesus
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
He's dead.
Oh. How did it happen?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
No, you don't.
This is definitely better.
Yes, I know But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
We're not ready!
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
Don't even joke about that!
Twinkeys!
Mom?
What?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good.
Marty...
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
We used pull.
It's all about who you know.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
But what kind of pull did you have?
Fuck!
So? How was school today?
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Yeah?
OK.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Dad? Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Thanks.
You're welcome. Dad? Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
You have beautiful skin.
Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.
It's over there.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
No, not really.
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello?
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh, I don't remember that...
I do.
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
Yeah, sure.
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Scooby?
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
You want some?
You a pervert?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Can I see what you have so far?
He did?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What are we going to do!
What now?
--be prepared.
We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Now what?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Well Filmore--
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
How well do you know this place?
Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
How's the arm?
It's nothing to worry about.
That's it! Up ahead!
Where does it lead?
Enjoying the tour so far?
Are you going to kill us?
You're going to pay for this...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
I insist...
Came over the satellite. We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
She's still alive.
Well?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
What about Cooper--where is he?
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
So, what are we looking at White?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How goes the roll call?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine. It checks out.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Gotcha. We've been filling barrels all day--we've got hell of a stockpile.
Good.
I say we head out.
Why should I worry? Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
Are we adrift--
If I don't get power up we are!
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I have your word, Mister President?
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try... 87 - 43 - 56.
Where is this...thing?
That's preposterous! We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Bah! All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
My seven body orifices????
That's right, fella.
Major?...Major? I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What?
What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major. Your rights will be fully protected.
Didn't they tell you?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute. The President!! That's it! The President!!!
What about the President?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
So what?
What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Yes!
General Schmuck?
Go back to sleep, baby.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
No, sir.
Well, Mister President.
General Schmuck?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Yes, sir. One thing, Mister President.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Why do you think I ask?
Good. Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Yes, sir.
All right, Major. I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
That's right. I want this flashed to all section immediately.
A shooting war!
Yes, Major. This looks like it's going to be it.
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir. But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Plan-R????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That is correct, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Suppose that were the case?
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Well, I'm not, sir. Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major. Our President holds the same views.
Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
They're coming in now.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
I've got the heading, Major. One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Thanks, Binky. Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
All right...we're still flying. I'm taking her down to the deck.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
What else could it be?
He's right. We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right. They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
A through H is correct.
Main interference linked to electronic detector. Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Check.
Check.
Forty-five. Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Twenty! Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now? He's sitting two feet away from me!
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Roger.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff. Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
I think they mean business.
Sorry, King. My leg's stiff as a board.
Hey, King. Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
So am I.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy. On behalf---
I've got one.
Shoot, Lothar.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
That's what I said.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Check, all bomb circuits green. Okay, Lothar.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.
Primary bomb is live.
All right, Lothat, that does it. Master safety on now until bomb run.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
What happened?
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
No, look! It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
You tell me.
Why should they call us back?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Right. So how could we get any messages?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Take it easy, Major Kong.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College: Never under- estimate your enemy.
Sorry, King.
Who's that?
It's me - Lothar. Are you okay?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
There's no other way, Lothar. Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
We're on course, Major. Just fixed our position on that river back there.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
At the bottom of mines?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
We are?
Mn-hm.
Um-hm.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey!
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Yeah.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Stuck with what guy?
What?
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Don't let 'em fight.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That's the rock star thing.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Sorry.
Jesus Christ.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
That sounds so depressing.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Go!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Fuck it!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
No, no.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Come on.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Come on man.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Great.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Oh, you were in the band?
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I can come visit?
You better! Yes!
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
It's safe, come on.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Good. See you later.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Yeah, we're all above that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Please.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Thanks. See man?
You make videos?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Thanks, man!
What's up guys?
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Will you stand up for me?
Okay.
Come on. Inside.
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Military marching bands.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
You cut off your little finger?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
What was your name again?
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Taking care of business.
Oh, sure.
Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
We were?
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
I'd love to read that.
Hi.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Can you tell me what happened?
He's drunk.
Uh-huh.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Who were you talking to?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Tim, what are you talking about?
See ya later.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
What?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
I hit her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, shit.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Just go home, alright?
Will you just put the gun down?
No.
Jeff, stay there.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
Seven-twenty.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
I don't know.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
That's right.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Please?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
You could've come over.
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
Was that supposed to be me?
No.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
It's a piece.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
So you can give me more shit?
Yes, you asshole.
About what?
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk?
This is ridiculous!
It was a racial incident.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
Jeff. Jeff.
What feelings?
Us.
Of course.
And?
So what do you wanna do?
Nothing.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Mm-hm.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, Pony.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
The prom. That's funny.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Sorry.
So you think I should?
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Great.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, not exactly.
So who are you?
What do you mean?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look Pakeesa...
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Get off my roof!
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Pony, oh my god!
Hey!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
New York, huh?
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Soon.
Yep.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You do?
Is that Jeff?
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
It's none of my business?
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Your manager?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
What?!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
Sorry, Kansas...
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Ahh! Baby's got two heads!!!
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay? We can skip the girl party this week.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
You sure?
Positive.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
No.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know. Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
Jack...
Trix...
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
I'm sorry.
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Nope. Sounds more like the first.
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Shut up.
NO! Wait...um... We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Hey. Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
Yeah, hold on.
Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't use big bills!
Hello?
Kim-Lo?
No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Yeah?
Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Ammo?
Hello?
We're dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Really...
Yeah. "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she? How is the old girl?
Definitely old.
Oh my G-d! I'm not first!
Wait a minute. You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
You sure you wanna go there?
Uh...maybe?
All of you!
Bank branch!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
I don't hate you. I need your help.
My what?
Your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Roll 'em.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days, are you?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it.
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Name dropper.
That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Hurt feelings department.
You forgot this.
Thanks.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows. How did you like it?
I didn't.
Thank you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
As for instance?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
O.K. I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
What teacher?
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Into what? A lampshade?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
I mean it. It's no good to me anyway. Help yourself.
I'll make it short.
Sorry. It's your baby now.
What has Artie to do with it.
We're engaged.
It's just impossible.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own. Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Oh, you --
Good.
What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
It will?
Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's Norma?
Who's who?
I'll say. This is solid gold.
Nice job.
Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
May I say you smell real special.
Was I? I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I just don't.
It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
Stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you've always wanted.
I don't want it now.
What happened?
Hello, Betty.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
This is where you live?
You bet.
Hers.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Her own movie theatre.
No.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, young fellow.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better. I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
What assistant?
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Get out.
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
Right now? Never let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.
Well?
This is fascinating.
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me? I'm busy. Just finished one script. I'm due on another assignment.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
It's getting kind of late --
Are you married, Mr. -- ?
The name is Gillis. I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Unpack nothing. I didn't say I was staying.
What's that?
Just a scene I cut out.
Cut away from me?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Not now, my dear. I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
Now what is it? Where's the fire?
I've lost my car.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
All padding. Don't let it fool you.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
It's a quarter past ten. What time are they supposed to get here?
Who?
You think this is all very funny.
A little.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What are the notes?
"Mad about the boy."
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Go away.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Have one of mine.
They're awful. They make me cough.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max. I'll get you some.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.
Don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I went for a walk.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
Yes, I am, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Oh. sure -- if it would make a good scene.
That's a lie! They still want me!
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Goodbye. Norma.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
You are not dressed properly.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Madame is waiting.
I made your bed this afternoon.
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom. I put in soap and a toothbrush.
I'm talking to you. My clothes and things are up in the room.
Naturally. I brought them myself.
Is that so!
Why are you so upset? Is there anything missing?
Some men are here. They asked for you.
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
Good.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
How come?
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Joseph C. Gillis?
We've come for the car.
Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Got a title?
Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.
Sure, Gillis. If something should come along -
Along is no good. I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Was it a sudden quarrel? Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Bring something to drink.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What is it?
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
But which one?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I think I'd better keep it.
Whatever you say.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
At last. Ultimate Power.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
Just like that?
Away. From you.
But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
Hi.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
You think so?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Before you go...
What?
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
Hmmm?
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I did.
Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I bet they do.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What is it?
A passionfruit smoothee.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
Why should I believe you?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
No!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You vicious--
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Well...I guess I can't.
Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, no thanks.
Someone's chasing him.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
What's a tree?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Where is Earth?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
I don't understand.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I can do that.
There isn't any.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not...an orphan are you?
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
But what for?
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
It doesn't seem right.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
He's nice.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
What? Me?
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That was meant for me!
Who are you ?
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
A cheap trick.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Where is inner space?
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
What is this place?
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Others?
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
What? Palace? Hardly.
You look at them? How?
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
There is a way.
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
Then come with me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here?
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman -- ...uh, chairperson...
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You're welcome...??
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
It sure is.
You know what's the problem?
Too much mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
But Lana, you could --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
I can never get a way from it.
The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that.
He really was!
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Kent!
Well... Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Sure.
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
What are you doing?
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
A television set?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
So where is all them half-centses?
How many sugars?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Gus?
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Black or regular?
Man, what is this?
Which country?
Columbia.
Columbia.
Wipe 'em out?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?
First question got to be "Where."
Hey, boss.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
KRYPTONITE!
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints.
For what?
A computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
Yeah? How's it look?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
You want to mess with Superman?
How you doing down there?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
Thanks. Let's go
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
I know, by computers.
Who is she?
Who's the other woman?
I didn't have my camera with me.
What about me?
Ricky? Where...what...
I'd wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
We've already met.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
The picture looks blurry.
What terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I thought you'd never get here.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Never. I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
I don't know you, lady.
But the other night...
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
I can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Gus?
Oh, Superman!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Where's the handle?
85,000 dollars.
Missing????
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
I don't kiss.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
She's not his mama either.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Today coffee----
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Where did it come from?
A normal person.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Are you okay?
Lois, I usually do.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
I don't?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
Really?
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
A "complimentary corsage."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Where were you?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Because of what I'm betting. My life.
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe you wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
I want to.
Let's go to my place.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Everything on it?
Uh...home...
Does Lois know about this yet?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Gee. But --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
A parka.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Mush! Mush!
Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Good. My heart can't take it.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
This way Lex.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Genius! -- Lex.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It has everything.
Wrong.
Artemis? Do you read me?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I think he said a "curl."
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Where?
North.
Why?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
He flies as well, then . . .
Constantly.
What do you want?
Superman! The --
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
You must be freezing.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
You said it. Three-to-one should get you both ears and the tail.
What more?
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
I wish I knew. -- Oh, God.
Who is this . . . Superman?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
DELETE IN CUTTING
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
He's captured Non!
General --- ?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
I really don't think . . .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
What about here?
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . my . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm not so sure you do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Regardez. Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Impossible? Why?
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Awesome!
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Is he for real?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I think there's an angle.
Who?
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What was that about?
He's . . . cold. . .
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
We'll all fry.
This wasn't in the plan.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
What I need this for?
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . . But you're... dead!
I'll deal with you later.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Nobody else.
He's thirty-five years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Me?
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
Lois isn't here?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
Mother...
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Your bookie?
No.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not...gray.
Are there any more at home like you?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
What now, my love?
Huh?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
There's no real proof that tobacco --
Can I take you to the airport?
Not unless you can fly.
I'm telling you, I was there.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
What'd you call him?
Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Is that what they're calling him?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just -- get to him.
Listen...thank you.
What are you doing here?
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Again???
You think he's for real?
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
Damn! This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton!
I read the article.
Meteorites!
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
You're happy, aren't you?
La de da da...
We just take it?
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready?
They stop for nothing.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in --
Don't let me down.
You?! How about me?
No news is not good news. Y'know
There was a recipe on the back --
A night on the town instead of under it?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy? Let's get high.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Tea?
You got wax in your ears?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Danger?? Somebody??? Lex -- where are you going?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts! It's suicide! Worse than that, it's genocide.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What're you writing, Lois?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Boy!
Gets you where you live, huh?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
It's a ...baby.
What's your name, boy?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
-- as we will be.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us. Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He will be odd, different.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
I don't know what to say. Look, I -- I just -
Enjoyed it?
I guess I got carried away
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Lois, the kickback story...
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
Well...flashlight?
Oh, I've got to get some matches. My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh. Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I broke the man out of prison --
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
They're killing me by inches! Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
I still don't get it.
What is this??!
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Well -- you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
On radio waves?
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes, we do know each other. I'm Alison Jones.
Yes.
Ally. That was my nickname.
Ally. That's right.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm fine. Still working with my father.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that. But she's well?
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Which one?
Which one?
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.
So there were others?
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going. To see her.
She's in trouble?
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I understand.
I can help you.
No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Hi, Nicole.
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Billy, please. The children.
How is Nicole? Is she around?
She's resting. In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Billy, that's too early.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
Yes.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
You're leaving.
Good night, Billy.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Yes.
Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...
From what?
You talked about it?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Berry-picking.
Yes. The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
That would complicate things.
He knows that? Billy?
Yes. He does.
You've talked to Billy?
I did.
What other people?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
That's what he said, is it?
Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
It's for the school bazaar.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No. A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
Summer's over. It's fall.
And winter?
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
Is this mine?
Yes. It's a present.
Nicole!
Did he say what about?
No.
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Is he coming over now? Right away?
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
That you didn't die? Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Dolores.
I object to the form of that question. Note that.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
Will you be spending more than a night?
What about Doreen?
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?
Yes.
What do they do?
Crafts.
Crafts?
Have they ever been busted?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
So what's the problem?
DADDY!!!
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news.
News?
Don't you want to hear?
That's not news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Yes.
I tested positive.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
I need money.
Do you have the blood test?
You don't believe me? You don't fucking believe me?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Some more wine?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
We do.
Is there shrimp on it?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
Yes.
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk. Nobody likes him. He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough.
How does the family survive?
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
No.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Yes.
You remember that much?
You are?
Before the actual accident?
I was scared.
Why were you scared?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
You saw the speedometer?
Yes.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.
Why not?
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
There wasn't time?
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
You remember this?
That was great.
Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
Of course.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
What took so long?
What's that?
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
How do you like it, Nicole?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
The door needs a lock.
That's too high. I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
Great.
Yes.
How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
She'll move away.
There's talk of that.
Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters. They're all inbred.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right! Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running? What am I missing here?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
Hello, Sidney. Wanna table?
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
He's somewhere...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy. The kid is only great.
See my mother?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You told him that?
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. Hey, wait a minute!
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now. See you two kids later!
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
No punch line. Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Not being partial, are you?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
No! NO! Don't touch me!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Hello, Harry.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come out? No.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
Mac! I don't want this man at my table...
I know Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Uh huh.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
How?
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
Can't hurt...
And who's feet is she on now?
Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Are you listening?
Talk to her, Sidney...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
What's all the rush? You said three o'clock.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
I thought he would.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU. Your secretary phoned.
What about?
Could this be that boy?
Bribing me again?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
You're sure. Find out for me.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you "interviewed"?
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
Yeah!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What sort of thing?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
What would you think of me if -
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
That's the third time he's called today.
It isn't. I've just seen the early edition.
But...
Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Go home, Sally. It's late...
You ought to be used to me by now.
If that's for me, tear it up!
Take a top coat.
What's the matter?
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
I know you do, Sidney.
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
It's a habit with me. So now I'm briefed. So what?
Why me...?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
Yes, but why?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I didn't do anything!
J.J., if you think -
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
You haven't told him yet...
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I made you write a beautiful song...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come.
Why did you call me?
You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
My God.
No good.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Where we going?
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Oww! Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Why?
Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
Why?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Swear.
What?
Everything.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live? I mean, last?
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great! See, you're getting it.
Smile?
We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean.
Excellent.
Not even of dying?
No.
Torque wrench please.
Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Why do you cry?
Alriight!! My man!
She intends to change the future somehow.
I guess, yeah -- Oh shit!!
Dyson.
This is tactically dangerous.
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Drive for a minute.
We don't have much time.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
No!
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
It must end here... or I am the future.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
No shit?
Out of the way, John!
No! Don't kill him!
It, John. Not him. It.
Yeah. Drag, huh?
Mom? You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
It's okay. It'll by okay. We'll figure it out.
I love you, John. I always have.
I got it. Piece of cake.
Ready to rock?
John, get out of the way!!
I know. This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you. I always will.
They took him from me.
I know!
Kyle, don't go!
You broke my arm!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Yes. It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
Is it safe for them here?
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
What does he mean, too correct?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm very sorry.
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Yes, David?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
You bet.
What?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Yeah.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Colonel. Pleasure.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Furtwngler's in a different category.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
No can do.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Three months.
Your mother, too.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Mine's the Eleventh.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
No. Ours was damaged.
I'm sorry.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
How come?
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Did you call someone you knew?
May I ask a question?
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Steve Arnold...
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have no idea.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I have illegitimate children.
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I don't understand what you mean.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Major.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
What?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
I've remembered something else...
Yeah?
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
One of your people told me.
And ask him about his private life.
Yes.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
You were in insurance before the war.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Mmm. Same schedule's okay.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
Here you go. You're a Bob's Girl now. Nancy will check you out.
Anything else?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
You can't to that...
That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.
What do you think?
Great.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Not lately. Did you check messages?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
Yes. Don't hurt me.
This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.
But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
And you're from the future too?
There's so much...
You cold?
Freezing.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
It's okay. Forget it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
What?
What's he like?
I volunteered.
Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Good field-dressing.
Sleep. It'll be light soon.
Okay. Talk some more.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Look. I found it. Isn't that it? Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Let's go. Time to move out.
Kyle?
Is this enough?
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl. You know.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said...
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
Sarah.
What are you doing?
So. You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay. Okay. But this... cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
Here, drink some of this...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I can't sleep.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.
Give me the short version.
That stuff's two hours cold.
I know.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No. Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her.
I just called.
Same shit.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Go! Go! He's got her.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch. If your father could see you now...
Are you finished?
Did you play recently?
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Christine! Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'm so sorry.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
It was an accident.
Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You've got to be kidding.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
Where are you going?
Home.
It was a gift... from my brother.
Long story. I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
You pull me up.
It's much easier this way. Come on, step up...
No.
Please...
I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
There's a ladder here.
I'll wait.
This is C.R.S.
What's C.R.S.?
Don't panic. When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
They'll love that.
You deserted me.
You're a grown man. I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton.
That's classic.
We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall.
Where are we going?
What exactly do you do?
Nice.
A fresh shirt...
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Right. Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
What is it?
Is this you?
I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
Do you mind if I sit?
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Want anything to drink?
You?
Take the picture out.
What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They're watching.
Wha... ?
No! I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
Get out.
I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead...
Who are "they?"
I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee.
How? How could they have gotten anything?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What did you say?
My name's not Christine. It's not my real...
It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
What?
Scams, con games. How many?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
How deluded can you be? There's no <u>why</u>...
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
They won't...
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
Stop talking...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Stop it!
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to show you...
I didn't know what else to call you.
Claire.
I have to get to the airport...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
"Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
You look good.
So do you. And to think I was worried...
About me?
How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
Never better.
Elizabeth?
Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated. What about you?
Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
Yeah.
You need anything?
No.
For you.
Call that number.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me. Call that number.
Why?
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Tell me you'll call.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises.
Tell me where we're going.
Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
What are you doing?
They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
What have they been doing to you?
Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them. They did this.
It's a flat tire. That's all.
How do you know?
We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.
The phone's dead.
Really?
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...
What?
Really?
Yeah.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine? The waitress.
Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
Robbed?
Yes.
Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
It's just a t.v. He's just an actor.
I'll explain someday.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call. I really will.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N... A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
I don't write the questions. I just review them.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Get rid of them.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Drive in.
You don't need me...
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton. Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did? How is he?
Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
Fine.
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you. Goodnight.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ?
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Was he morose, or...? I mean...
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight. See you home.
What's the trouble?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Your brother. Will you come with me?
What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
No.
Your ex-wife.
What?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me? I'm afraid I don't...
What the fuck... ?!
Why are you following me?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is?
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
Don't ask.
What's happened...
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor?
You know you can.
Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well. If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi. I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
What?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldn't get the last ones. You?
Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
And those are Luke's and mine.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's a question.
It's not going to hold your weight.
Hey! I heard screaming...
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
All night?
Yeah.
You want company?
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell!
Are you working with her?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
All the carvings.
The cold sensation. Who felt it first?
Nell! What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
Hmm.
I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study.
Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
The children want me. They're calling me. They need me.
Come on.
You know what he's really upset about?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
What's this? What's this... this picture?
That? That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
Oh! You scared me.
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Why?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
No one could. No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper.
That's why we're here.
Not really.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Jeez.
I love this house. I really love this house.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes. I've missed it.
Good night, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
What's his first name?
David.
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
Are you sure?
I think so.
I don't think I want any.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
I like the colors.
We all did.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think someone is here.
We think?
No.
Why not?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
You should have let me do the talking.
Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
As it happens. I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
You broke last time.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Yeah?
Man knows what he likes.
Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item. Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
Eduardo. Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
Huh?
This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Boomerang.
What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
You're kiddin' me, right?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
No. Not at all. Do we?
Five years, I think. Long time.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets, eh? Aren't we all la-de-da.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
What are we standing on?
Bring the motor around. Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
Steady on.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
I've been wondering something.
Again?
Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Really.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
When did you get in?
Yesterday. Afternoon.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
Why not.
Are you serious.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
On what. What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
You don't seem bothered.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
Did you. What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight. What about just now?
Just now? Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away. Or is all this just new to you?
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Yeah, well, you're here now -- -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Never thought of that. Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done.
It was you. Downtown.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
Don't you work with Ian?
Ian?
Sorry. Wasn't me.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.
Sounds like you need a rest.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow.
Good luck.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive. Good idea. Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
So what.
I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what. You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
Something's on.
You do?
You bet.
What's in it?
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson.
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
Are you finished?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
Pleasure.
Have we met? There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London. I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
Thanks. You, too.
What.
Tell me.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes, Ann?
Yes?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Hello, Birdy.
Yeah.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Geez, Mr Crane.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Birdy--
...No, please.
...You are ze fahzer?
Uh-huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
...Mm.
I don't understand.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
...she can go up there.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
You got the dough?!
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
No problem!
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
Cash.
That'll be fine.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
How ya doin', Ed?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Mm.
She's a rare one.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
Mm.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
I, uh...
Rye.
Just coffee.
Told what?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
Honey?
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
You don't have to--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Honey...
...Doris--
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
...I don't think so.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
...Probity.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Huh?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Whuddya mean?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...How you today, Ed?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
...We goin'?
Huh?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
I don't understand.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.
...You're Ed Crane?
...I'm Crane.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Hello!
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
He's a barber.
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Homicide.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
Manual overrides aren't working. I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Beauregard! You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Sweet Jesus!
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Forget it!
Battery's dead. Shit.
Hurry up!
Fifteen... what's next?
Ippolito! Get back here!
D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in.
Who are you? The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
The body?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.
I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.
What happened to them?
Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look. It's some kind of letter.
Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Lieutenant! It's me.
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
All right. Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Curious. There's something missing.
Please. Don't humiliate me further.
How can you say that? You know it's not true.
Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
What's going on?
Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
What's that?
I'm coming with you.
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed. These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
Where is that?
What's that?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
You work here?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
What is it?
Big as a house.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head back.
They've got something.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo! Hobbes!
Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right.
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no. I smell it.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How about lunch?
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Maybe not.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
And John?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
You were going to be married.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
I don't understand.
What happened?
Where did you see it?
That's not what I saw.
Pendergast? Are you all right?
You're not. Where is it?
Gone.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
Help someone!
You smell that?
No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
Just like John. He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
I can't!
I'm sorry to keep you. How can I help?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji? What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu. For how many?
Today.
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
Close up?
Why is he in the basement?
What's to see?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
We've declared a curfew. Everyone else is at first positions.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we--
Cue music...
What music?
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
That and a fat, new contract.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
A window onto the human condition?
Are we talking Emmies?
Certainly a nomination.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Who are you?
The creator of what?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i> Then who am I?
Nothing was real.
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
How can they have a child?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
You take Japanese.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right. Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay. I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
No...I, er.
No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
No.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Now.
Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Yeah? Outta what?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
You think so?
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
Who?
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
Yeah...
That's the "Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Stay where you are!
Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing.
What's that?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Every time you and Marlon--
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I won't be here Sunday.
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
You hate gambling.
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Stop this now. I'll do it. I swear.
Who were you talking to?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
How are you, Mother?
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Now what?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
They're coming. Any minute.
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--How do you know about that?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore."
I don't understand.
How's it going, Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
Not supposed to talk about it.
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Yup.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I need your clothes, Byers.
You've been back to Dallas?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Working with?
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Yes.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Who called this meeting?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh?
What's that?
You looking for him for some other reason?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Have you examined them?
How's that?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
You a reporter?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Who sent you?
And what's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How can I reach you?
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
Mulder...?
Now what?
Had you.
No you didn't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I wake you?
No.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.
It's like jelly.
I'd been told as much.
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
All the equipment is brand new.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it...
Mulder --
What do you think it is?
This is weird, Mulder.
Very weird.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Scully....?
Yeah...?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I have. I did. It's done.
Just like that --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
What? What happened?
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Cold...
We've got to keep moving.
Where are we?
I can't go any farther.
We're going to the morgue.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Agent Mulder --
How deep does this go?
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
About the conspiracy?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
Our vaccine may have no effect!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
We've been over this a dozen times. No.
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
I do it all the time!
You're sure? Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.
The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll be fine.
Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or...
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
What's wrong?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner.
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
Agent Novak?
Peter, okay?
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Then what is he?
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
You're sure of that?
Wait...
He wants us to follow. The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
That went well.
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep. Eloped.
Well look at that.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
They're hungry.
Thank you.
No problem.
You liked him?
What now?
Who says?
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Agent Cole.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
Delano?
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Intravenous administration complete.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
Into Stargher. Inside...
I have done this, you know. Been inside.
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
That's a secret.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
I need it.
Now?
The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that.
How is she?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We proceed assuming she is.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Right here.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Give her some cigarettes.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
Sit down.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Why?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Drink?
Harry?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
...you know.
He liked to laugh.
...again.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
I shall be all right.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
That's his headache.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
No.
He works in a military hospital.
You can help us.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
I don't want it.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Yes, of course.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
See much of him before that?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
What?
Him dying like that.
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A parrot bit me.
Well?
Do you see what that means?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
Bring him in.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
How about the doorway?
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
Of course.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
Win what?
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Be sensible, Martins.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
They wouldn't know me.
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Goodness, that's awkward.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
She's been arrested.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You've got plenty of contacts.
As long as they can use you?
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Coffee.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...you.
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
The Roumanian?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Find out?
Could he have been at all conscious?
In great pain?
Speak English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
...Popescu...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You don't mean that doctor?
Now, hold on.
Yes, it is.
Harry...
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Funny?
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime. Harry Lime.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'll share something with you.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Nice work.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
I don't know - I'm American.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
A shark fin?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
Two.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
Not too bad.
Hi.
So from there to there?
We swim.
Have you told someone?
No.
I think so too.
Incredible.
Exactly.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
We lost our key.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
They only kill them when they love them?
What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Fucking Danny, man...
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
That's a movie, you moron.
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What, do you like it here?
You coming?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yes.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
I don't, but...
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
I have a job.
This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I don't care about money.
You will.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Is he a Nazi?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What's he care about?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
Your father??
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
Va-yomer... And he said. It goes the other way.
Oh, yeah...
I want to learn to read it.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Why not?
That's stupid.
What assholes.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both. Aleph...
The sex is better.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
You gotta get out of here.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Leo Strauss... I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Is it okay if I record this?
A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Listen to me....
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
It was a nine millimeter.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
Hello...?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Steve...
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
Hello...?
Who told you that?
Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.
Which was his room?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
You could do it.
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else.
Where?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
You remember Miriam....
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Why me?
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
How?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
You missed on purpose.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
And what did you do?
What are you trying to say?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
"Do chickens give milk?"
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Fund-raising??
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
We tested the new bomb.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
Eat shit....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
You're going to live here permanently?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
And you...? Do you love Enzo?
You're leaving?
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What d'you mean?
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
No!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You're right. You're fired.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
I tell you she's mine!
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Where did you two meet?
You forgot the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
And just where are you from?
Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.
Well, good night, then...
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Jacques! Johana!
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn. He is learning.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Dollars.
Roberto? How long?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
Yes?
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No...
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Why?
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
I remember. Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
Well, what are they?
That's good.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
People say that?
No, no!
Not at all!
Enzo?
What?
Madame...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No.
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Why?
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
What?
Here... Here...
What is it?
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
That's good.
I'm concentrating.
You say that because you have the title!
No! I would never cheat you.
You were right.
... I was right about what?
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
I recognize you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
Please, have a seat.
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
How do you know that?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
How are you?
I got fired.
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
And you?
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
What?
Jacques...?
What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Why don't you ask me?
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
Again?
... And the new stereo.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
You called the police?
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Wait! Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What's up?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
So. Do you have a name?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mordechai?
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
But we're not open on Sundays.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
What's wrong with him?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
What are you doing?
A stereo type alarm system?
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What should I charge?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
I wasn't too over the top?
You okay?
Get off of me you cripple!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
What day is it?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Is he in love with you?
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
Then what do you do?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Sure.
Where's that man?
Sure, I like my leopards
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Who?
Cut.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
See you tomorrow -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita  I have wondered -
What, senorita?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Hey  I'm over here.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's right, of course.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
More or less.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
To the eye? Like other men.
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
That was unfortunate.
I've disturbed you. I'm sorry -
Go on foot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
What are you getting at?
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
State hunters?
Yes. The lipstick.
That's a fact, isn't it?
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
Yeah.
 As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I know. Funerals.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
What! You can't be --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
No. No, thanks. Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Thats right.
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brothers death.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
I found this at your brothers.
You... You found that at Leons?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Excuse me?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Something like that.
Something like that?
Something like that.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
So you did talk about it, huh?
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Crow what?
Croissants.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
By your Austrian?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
A criminal?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.
Weve still got the Italian...
Im calling about the puppies.
May I have your phone number?
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
...On holiday?
Whos the money man?
Ever seen him before?
No... No... I swear...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
The company. We all work for the company.
How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
B-Black...
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
May I...?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I hope its not too significant.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The 1,000 is on account.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
What happens now?
Vous tes Franais?
Problems?
Is my money in there?
Lets go.
Am I supposed to know him?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Is this Friedman?
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, its me... Huh... Its sad.
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Yeah.
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
Five to three. Youre early.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
And while visiting our fair city you... An Austrian?
An Austrian.
Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Should I be?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Whats the date?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Er... Yes...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
Hows the boy doing?
Fine...
Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up?
I... How long have I been here?
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Welcome to the club.
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
What about his girlfriend?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!
Cinq cents.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre. Pas avant la matine.
O est pass ton salon?
Alors?
Then why dont you reach him?
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Gluck.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
Youre the lantern man, huh? If you wanna see whats left of him...
The acid bath?
Why did you kill him?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
Try again, and this time be polite.
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
When they realise Im missing...
Mossad?
Cost what?
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
That's a good idea, sire.
What do you mean?
Majesty, I can't...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Very generous of you all. How much?
What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Now?
Jeanne, stop it!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
What's going on?!
Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Well...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it. I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Tell me...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But it is what I want.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I am ready now...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne's alive!
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Trial? What trial??
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not long ago...
When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
What were you doing when the voice came?
Praying.
The voice was in your cell?
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Many things...
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Please... may I have it back...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You will??
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I'm... I'm not the king...
... You look wonderful...
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I really think you...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
His face.
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?
Go on to the next question.
5,000 gold crowns.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Good. Where are the English?
I know...
Good. Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The wind will be against us...
What's going on?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Well...? Shall we go?
Not yet.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Damn right!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes. We can pray.
This is no good!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Clear?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
No... not like this...
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
I... submit to Our Lord.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Stop it! What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not? He has good teeth...
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
No.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
I don't know... I thought...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Why were you yelling like that?!
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes!
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
No. That was a sword in a field.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
In His name??
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
"Love your enemies"...
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
Beautiful.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Jeanne, be patient.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Who are you?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Wladek, please.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you?
We're recruiting.
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
A good place for what? He's insane!
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
It's not funny.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
I can look after myself!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Otherwise what?
Very appropriate.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, Kitten.
How long have you been here?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more. But.
You made contact?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
To be deaf?
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
There is something to be said for silence
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Ohh the tag is broken.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
The Alps.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
The piano.
You'd have to organise it up here.
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
He chopped it off
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Oh no, it can't come now.
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
What on?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
You've missed this bit.
And when is the next lesson?
Play a gig.
Do I know any gigs?
You the owner here?
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2. That ain't bad.
The wallet. You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
Thanks. I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
How bout you? I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist! When did you get back in town?
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late. Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
What's eatin' you? I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
Then why ain't he dead?
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
I just got the count. We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
There's always a depression on.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I like griftin'.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
Which one?
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You mean you blew it.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
I'll take him anyway.
Why?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
You beat him, kid.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
The wire is ten years outa date.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 500.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
Never get enough, huh pal? I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
I'll square it with the fixer.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Thank you. You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where you goin'?
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
What time you get off work here?
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
What the hell for?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
So could Shaw.
Why me? Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
You stayin' in or not?
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen. All of it bad.
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
How am I gonna do that?
You want a drink or something?
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
We missed him.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know. He took it hard.
We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
For fifteen years.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
Sorry. I don't know anything about it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What about this Rosebreen?
He was?
Yes. He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
All settled? Grand! Why did your mother ever divorce him? He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
She's got me worrying, too.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
What?
Nothing.
How are you?
Another young man.
Well!
That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.
I can't.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
Give it to me.
What is it?
That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Don't. It's horrible.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
I don't think you will. It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Oh!
Mother!
How are you? Here. Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
You know, we know each other.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
Not that scrawny little....?
Yes.
Andy... this is Nick Charles. He worked on a case for father.
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
Macaulay.
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Your father?
How do you do? I'm sorry we have to rush.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
There.
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
Hello, Dorothy.
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
You see how much we have to say.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
What would your mother say to that?
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
A new invention?
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
And he still wants to marry me!
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not a thing.
Did you kill her?
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Yes. I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Not without a warrant.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
What about the suicide?
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
What about Jorgensen?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Trail him! Trail who?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
I said he hadn't written me.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
That's all right. Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
You did!
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more to come.
Have a shot?
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
Want to take a poke at him?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right. All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Why, you said...
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
What bonds?
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Go ahead!
Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
I'll give it back to you .... all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello. Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
One hundred... two hundred... three...
Never mind.
I wish you'd count them. There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
No.
Well, let me do that for you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
I haven't been a detective for four years.
I see. I see.
How are you?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
Well, don't you?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Dorothy! Is she here?
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Nobody told me. I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
What's that?
Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
What am I? The fall guy?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
You might have mentioned me first.
He's well-trained. He'll behave himself.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
What hit me?
Who's that?
Come on -- relax -- Give them a drink.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
Where did you get that?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
But it's Christmas now.
Breakfast.
Nick! Nick! There's someone to she you,
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there.
It's all right. It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?
You're a fine watch dog.
On it! I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
No. It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Let's see. Where's it from?
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Well, that's that. Stay there, Nick!
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this?
Looks like a hold-up!
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Back to California
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
Huh?
Well, don't they?
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects! They won't come.
Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Nick Charles here?
Yes. Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase. It's at the Grand Central.
I'm sorry... but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Where are you going?
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Paper.
What's it say?
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
Wha...
They shouldn't have been here.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so--
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
Ready?
All right. Let's get out of here.
We can't just go off and--
The US Army: Always an adventure.
What do you figure it to be?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
Epps!
You ready?
What about the gold?
What about it?
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe I do.
What happened?
Stop it!
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
What about Jaeger?
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
What are you doing?
At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Blow me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
What!? What!?
Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map.
It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right.
Now this is war.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
They're not going to--
Steady it out!
She okay?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
It'd make their heads explode.
...I know.
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God! Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're going to be fine.
This. Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I don't hear any--
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
Iraqis. A bunch of them.
They're doing more than slapping.
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
Wait.
Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
We should head Northeast.
We'll find our way.
How!?
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
No.
No.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
You still got a map on you?
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
I pick that way.
Getting cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
Don't you touch it.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
Can't you--
I just said I would. I don't think I--
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
...Wes...?
I didn't say that. I never said--
Can you ride a horse?
Which way do we go!?
Damn it. We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
Epps?
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I don't know.
Australia.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He's not slowing.
Woods.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
That shouldn't be too hard to read. Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
What is this?
Now you need me.
He says it's a box.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
Jaeger?
Yeah. So?
That's in two days.
It doesn't mean anything.
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We...we could go home with something else.
What?
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah! Gold! How much?
If there's gold. If!
Iraqis.
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
Yeah! Yeah!
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We have to go back.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
So?
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
What the hell are you doing!?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
You're going to burn up in those.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
I can't hear him.
Stress category.
Correct. Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with....
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Permant cortex bond.
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
4732...?
Control ON.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
Vocasity
I'm not hungry.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What's this? Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
What did you get?
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
When?
Now.
Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I don't know.
Don't go.
I have to... he's a G-34
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Look, food!
That's not food. Can't be food.
What time is it?
What?
I said what time is it? How long was I out?
It's 3+27 hundred
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
No! Don't go.
Don't take anything.
I'll try.
What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
No....I though I'm afraid.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What are you doing?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
You don't know. You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX!
What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.
What?
We're leaving.
Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.
I can just barely see him. I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us. He can't make it alone.
Wait! I'll talk to him.
We must escape. We have plans. We can leave. We must wait until...
I can't see him at all. He's been destroyed.
How far did you go? Was it cold?
I've got it! Astounding!
Where is LUH?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
You're in violation.
I'll report you. It's....
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going....
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
What?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
Which way?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
What?
Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
Who? Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
This one has eyes. Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
That's not it.
She's not there
No...... She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
Yes...
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Hey, that's the guy-
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
Alright, let's check it out.
What was-? Why...?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
So what were they doing here?
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
How long are we going to stay?
Right.
You guys seem pretty tight.
So cut both.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
What?
I terrible with mechanical things.
It's working.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Yeah, another round thing.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Which one's which?
I don't know.
What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
You got it.
Any word?
Bev, you're the greatest...
C4, plastic explosive.
Computer device?
Glass, what is it?
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Alright!
Jesus...
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Thank you.
Then why tell me?
You okay?
Alex-
What is that?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping here?
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
What the hell's going on?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Vice... Jesus.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Oh shit...
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Look who's talking, old man.
Next week we work the park.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
You okay?
Mike...
Don't talk.
It don't work-
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
A what?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Nice to be here.
Captain...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
What?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Sir...
What's this?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
No!
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ... Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, sir? What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.
I want to see--
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron! I beg your pardon.
You can trust me.
Um-hum ...
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
I've got to see you.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Disappointed?
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
What?
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
Filiba ...
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Five, seven, and nine--
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
And you--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Yes...?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse-- empty. One vanity case--
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
What?
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
Oh?
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
Madame.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Correct! Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
Yes, Gaston?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Two lumps, madame?
Please! Thank you.
Yes, madame?
You see-- Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Right!
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
The ship will sink.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
The partners want to know how it's going?
There's a satellite call for you.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You told me to change.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
But I was with him the whole time.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You're a good liar.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Bollocks.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Why have we stopped?
We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
Could I speak to you in private?
So, you got a name by the way?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
What is it? A sapphire?
Where to, Miss?
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
This is crazy.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
It's bad.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's so cold.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I promise.
Never let go.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes sir.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
I'm sorry.
Is your stateroom alright?
Would you like anything?
It's been 84 years...
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
It's so unfair.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
Sure!
Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.
I can explain--
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
Baloney!
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
I don't understand.
You'll excuse me.
Will you pardon me?
Did you find it?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
Aces full.
You're coming back--
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
I'd <U>like</U> to be. Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--are you?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
Like her paint job?
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
Where have you been hiding?
Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Never eat before the show.
This is Mr.--er--
Brett is the name.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Lonesome?
What, again?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me-- I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Come on-- I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Oh, Shortie!-- --there's a girl on this ship--
--there's thousands of 'em!
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
Are you screwy?
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
You keep it--
<U>Me</U>!
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Come in!
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I thought you were a sucker--
That goes two ways.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up-- How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Hello, young fellow!
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I should say not.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
Here you are, sir.
Where do you live?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
That's me!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Hello, Denby!
Well, did you find me?
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too much of a load.
I was never stiffer in my life.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
I didn't--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
Everything O.K.?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting-- --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What do you mean?
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Somebody's got to do it--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What happened to you?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
What for?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Can you read 'em Jack?
The country boy's about due.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
I wish I could.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Yes, Yes!
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
Why?
Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
That's the truth--every single word!
I sincerely hope so--
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
He's certainly good-natured.
"Smooth's" the word.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
What's the matter?
I thought I had our sailing covered up-- --and here it is.
Sure, Sis.
I'm all right.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Everything in order, sir? What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Telegrams.
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday. In or out?
God damn son of a...
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Oh, my God...
Newcomers, eh? Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff. Just Hit town?
Just this minute. I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
What d'you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very. And very married.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I don't understand.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Shut up, Ike.
Hey, you smell that? Smells like Something died.
I'm retired.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys? Cowhands ride for the brand.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right. This brand. How 'bout you?
This brand.
Look at that! Yeah! Come and get Some, boy!
Let me, let me, yeah! Die, you Bastard...
Forget it.
That's the rumor.
You retired, too?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Age quod agis.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Ecentus stultorum magister.

Ignore her?
I'd ignore her. People can Change, Doc.
Satisfied?
He's drunk.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt! Just in time. Pull up a chair.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
But Doc-
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
Doc...
So what does he want?
What does he want? He wants revenge.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wyatt. God, I'm so sorry.
That's all right, Doc. Don't worry.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
What?
You know, Stephen Foster. "Oh, Susanna". "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
A which?
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
Not half as bad as I feel.

Awful lot of money.

Colorado's closer
There they go. Look kinda like preachers.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!

Easy, gents. Private affair... Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
We should get moving.
Look pretty rough.

Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
Here they are again. Look at 'em.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
It's too late -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sure they will.
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'd rather die alone.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times - Torture them.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
- We all want what we can't have?
Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Your new car.
Yes -
Wait a minute -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is this another one of your games?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Shhhhh...
Paris -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
It must do something.
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
That's reassuring.
Hey - the world is my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Interesting presentation.
Interesting video tape.
... Does this do anything?
Married?
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
Thanks. Take care -
Bourbon. Neat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Nice to run into you again.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
- You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
This has got to be a mistake.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And when might that be?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
... What's Harmsway done?
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
Sabotage?
... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Stop it!
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Sakwa!
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
I am. What do you want?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
What's your name?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
No.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Yes -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What's wrong?
How is it now?
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
He brought that up from the wreck.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
How sweet.
That was too close.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
It's a trick! After him. They're in the south stairwell!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are they alive?
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Will the cruise set it off?
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Why does he always pick on me?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
You okay?
Like a veil has been lifted?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Do you think you won?
Who is it?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
What is that?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Your feet are cold.
Go back to sleep.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Hush.
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
What did you put on it?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Man, act like this is your home.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Harry, you know everything.
How is everybody?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon, ladies.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
None of your business.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
When did you talk to Harry?
What are you doing?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow! Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah!
Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Come on down, guys. It's time for games! We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy! I'm heading out the door.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey! Wow!
What? What is it?
Woody! Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
Here! In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
What are you doing over there?
We're almost there.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
T-O-Y. Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?! Where?!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh. Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Ow! Watch where you're going!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was --
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
Come on, this way!
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
Woody! It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
Woody?! What are you doing?
Ha-ha!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
Me? No, no, no, no... Are you?
No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Hi!
Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
Miss. G-6.
Ohhh! You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Hey!!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Sid, give her back! Give her back now! I'm telling!
MOM!! MOM!!
Oh, no!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
That ain't no happy child.
Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Laser-envy.
Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
No! No, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!!
Toss 'im overboard!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
It's too short! We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir! No Sir!
Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Last present!
Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home.
There.
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you?
Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Woody?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Woody! Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
But you're Irish!
You'll put your clothes here.
There's no mirror.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Go away.
Do what? Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Finn -
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
Reprieve.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I'm Melanie.
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I don't know what you mean.
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
Anna. What's wrong? What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
What? What is it?
Why does he need money?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
I want to believe you. I really do.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
How much do I pay him?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Helena --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.
Don't bother.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
That's frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. I tried --
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.
Why?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Barbara --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Caroline --
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
You all right?
How's David?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
How long's the job?
Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you? What? You're going away. You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
In school?
Private?
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's. All A's.
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Are you kidding... I'm staying with you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won. He was a winner. That bothers you.
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Depends on the state.
Arizona.
I'll put this in the back.
No --
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Not Tiger Woods.
David --
Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for ice-cream?
Yes.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
It's a death sentence. I'll never make it to the trial.
He hired you. That was a mistake.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes. Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo. That's nothing new.
You first.
I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
She's nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
Please. Filing a report will not help you find your car.
A group of us are going out tonight.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
It's no problem. I was just with everybody we work with.
Madrigal's alive.
What?
Somewhere safe.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
It's important that we work together. Mexico. America. One hand washing the other.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
One question. How did you find about this?
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
I'm aware of that.
It could mean that, yes.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
My work keeps me young.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
This is a business. Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
She snuck away. And we haven't seen her. She hasn't come home.
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hey man, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Hello.
Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do you mean?
Your dad's a doctor. Call him --
He's a research doctor. You're dad's a doctor, too --
What kind of research?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
What?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
OK. Same again?
I'll be right after you.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You've stabbed me, man.
Twenty thousand.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
For fuck's sake.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
What?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Jesus.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
I'd fucking kill you.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Great.
What?
Eh-
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Right. You can't sleep here.
What?
Out.
Jesus.
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
It's Iggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Unless you get caught.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What? Steady like?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What happened?
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
There's no need.
It's no problem.
No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
You take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.
Good luck, Spud.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Right.
But try too hard --
And you might get the fucking job.
Exactly.
Nightmare.
Another dab?
You Only Live Twice?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
Who wrote it?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
You don't know, do you?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Say something, Mark, say something --
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
I can't believe you did that.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What was your price?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
What's on the menu this evening?
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
There.
It's the great outdoors.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
We go for a walk.
What?
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
He has his doubts...
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
No, no, it's not possible.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
My pain?
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Rescued at last.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
Plotting our new course.
New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
Following new course. Warp seven.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Raise shields.
But the shuttle-
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
What's going on?
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Can we have it quiet?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Your pain runs deep.
What do you know of my pain?
Where did you get this power?
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
But how?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
Oh, God
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
Not General Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I cannot be certain.
But he does seem familiar?
I do not often think of the past.
What do you mean?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Why?
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
You mean he's your brother brother? You made that up!
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
I am here, Captain.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s."
A "t."
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Hmmm?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
I must have your starship.
Who are you?
We must change our course at once.
Spock... What have you done to my friends?
No... I didn't.
Now learn something about yourself.
Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
You are mad!
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. I will not.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
Sybok.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
Did you say Group 7 access?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
What for?
To warn him.
Of what?
For what?
For being on to Dillinger.
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Beautiful!
Come on in...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
That all you can say?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no... You're a bit.
For sure...
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
Yes!
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Yes. It felt like Flynn.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Cute.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Who is your User, program?
Dumont!
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Alan!
Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it -- ?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
What's that?
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Flynn... Where's Ram?
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
How about you?
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Why? What are you going to do?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Flynn... you can't... I
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
How 'bout yourself?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey... !
We have to talk.
So...how's the world of serious science?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Thank. you, Master Control.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
New guy...
Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
What do you think?
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
That's all going to change, Yori...
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
It's something Users do.
Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.
Helen! It's your mystery man.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you going?
I'm done.
Where are you off to young lady?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
Okay, Dad.
How was school today?
Yeah, right.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Uh huh. Right here in river city.
Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
They call him "The Sand Spider". *
Why?
Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy?
Harry! Where are you!
Harry? HARRY?!
What's this for?
What a team. See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Son of a bitch!
Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Don't be ridiculous. She's only -- how old is she?
Fourteen, Harry.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four.
You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What? It's on the way. She says she's got something for me.
Station wagon?
What's the plan?
There's another guy, still in the car.
Copy that.
So, you wanna play huh? You little--
Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny.
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen. Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Congratulations. Welcome to the club.
It can't be. Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about? We have that.
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who? *
Give me the page.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She's still at my house. *
You tell on me, I tell on you.
She's lying.
She could be telling the truth.
We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
He's got it.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
But you didn't. Why not?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No! Never!
So, it was your first time.
My husband is a good man.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Yes.
Yes what?
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty.
Oral hygiene?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Hi, honey. How was the flight?
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
I'm late.
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh. Okay.
It's not okay. It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I'm sorry. Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Why did you continue to see him?
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
And you agreed?
Yes.
I don't know. I guess I needed something...
This Simon. Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her! Right now!
What?
Do you still love your husband?
Yes.
Oh, gee thanks. Mmmm, let me see--
Yes or no.
What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
I can do it!
Natasha?
Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go. She's not important.
What were you doing there?
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No. But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
What?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
As much as you used to?
What are you going to do?
Oh shit.
Not yet. But we'll find him.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
So what's your angle?
Sorry. Trade secret.
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Beat it.
I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
What?
Boris and Doris?
Who's your little friend?
I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Like one?
Hello?
Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Where were you? On a... uh, * mission?
Worse than Cairo? *
Did you read the papers yesterday?
That was you?!
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
Were they trying to kill you? *
You'll call me then?
To our assignment.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I don't know. I have to think...
Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name?
Helen.
What do you want me to do?
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Who is this woman?
His wife.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
What letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
Bye-bye.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I took a cab.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Sure. Why not?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Would you like to get some pie?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.

Almost four years.
Four hundred bucks.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
I love Janis.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
So he really loved her?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You didn't do nothing.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Who and what is a Drexl?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
What?

You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?

Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I think what you did was...
What?
I think what you did...
What?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Cancoon.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
What?
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
You'd really do that?
I don't blame you.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence?
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You're really in love, aren't you?
This shit can't be real.
It's fuckin' real! It's fuckin' real!
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I know.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Where?
The zoo.
The zoo. What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Clarence.
Yeah?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Really?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
What are we gonna see?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Want an animal cracker?
Leave the gorillas.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Don't you?
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Why does he trust you?
We grew up together.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Wanna count your money?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I can, but I don't.
What do you want from me?
Do you still have friends on the force?
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
I got some money I can give you -
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
On their honeymoon.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was very good.
Thank you.
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That Vietnam movie?
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
We talked him into it.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Not a tiny little vial -
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're no longer an extra -
Or a bit player -
You do more than try.
You do.
He knows.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
We gotta get him outta there.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Wake up, Cole.
No, sir!
Well?
Him? You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
I understand. There'd be no point.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
We're very close! Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
That's him.
It's important to observe everything.
They forced me to take drugs.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
"James"! Nobody ever calls me that.
What kind of information?
Change what?
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
No.
Why not? Most people have some ID.
You wouldn't understand.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
I have to go.
A jail? Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air. This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean. No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
This is April, right?
July.
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore?
It's just a shot to calm you.
No more drugs. Please...
Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You used to call me "James".
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
"Never cry wolf!"
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
My notes. Observations. Clues.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Are you hurt?
Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I told you what I want. Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
Mason???
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot! Who shot you?
You smell so good.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
I don't understand what we're doing.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that? You were in prison?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
It was? I didn't...know.
What does this mean to you?
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
They hurt you!
What are you talking about???
What're you writing? You a reporter?
It's private.
What...???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I get it! This is your old plan, right?
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
How did you find me?
The phone call, man. The phone call.
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?
That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle.
You want to go in? Examine him?
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
What? What did you say?
Hey! You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
Well, a man with some gumption. How much money you got?
Nothing.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Thirty-bucks? That's it?
That's my morning's pay.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Will be.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It's nonsense.
It will.
And what are you? A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
Where in Mexico would you like--
How much.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got.
I'm sorry, sir. It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Accident.
You got to be more careful. I remember one time--
Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Hey.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch!
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Two-hundred.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Goddamn you! You son of a bitch!
What you want?
Open up!
We're closed. Come back in the morning.
It is morning.
I want my car.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
What's it to you?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Let me get your change.
Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes. Yes it is.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.
Jake. I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
How could I? I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
What are you afraid of? I'm the one's got the gun. Stay here.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
Thank you, John.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Sierra? What for?
Least you can leave.
Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place you got here.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
There. All done. Lift me down.
What?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look.
Like you.
Beautiful?
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have ideas.
All right, Grace. No more games.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Damn it, Grace! Tell him.
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
How far is it to California?
From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
Where?
He doesn't give it to us. We take it.
You live pretty good.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
How much money has he got?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
John, please--
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
What are you talking about?
Shit!
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I thought you couldn't leave. I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
What was I supposed to do?
Where's the safe?
Nothing. There's no safe under here.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You're calling Jake stupid? You!?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there. More than that.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
What about him?
You got a suitcase?
Where are you going?
To get my car.
Yeah. Good thinking.
Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
One-hundred-thousand dollars. A little more.
That's all talk. He's got nothing on us. He let you kill Jake.
Give him the money.
What?
You heard me. Count it out.
I shot him.
You killed him!
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?
He was going to--
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
John!
Are you all right?
I think I busted my leg.
I can't make it. Grace? Grace!?
John! Can you hear me? Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.
What for?
The trunk. It's locked.
It's not locked. I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace. You were going to drive off and leave me here.
No. I swear it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Someone will find me.
Yeah, they'll find you. Dried up and twice dead.
You idiot! You'll kill us both!
At least I'll have company when I die. Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
A lot that means.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna. That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
Wait a second--
Would you?
Would I what?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Good Lord. What happened to you?
No.
Hungry?
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning. In your car.
That was just loose talk. I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here? That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How do you put a price on murder?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Thirteen-thousand dollars. Had you done it. Isn't that what we agreed on?
You think that's a lot of money?
All I have in the world.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Yeah, well, me too.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say. I don't even have it yet.
Darrell giving you problems?
That's not the reason I'm here. I swear it.
There's another reason? It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
Two-hundred dollars.
I asked you a question.
Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?
What?
What happened to your hand?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She's dead.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister. Mister. I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
They're not very imaginative?
Not before I settle with you.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Let me guess. This robber; he gets your money.
No. He gets shot by the old lady.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Fucking kid. And look at you; breaking fucking pencils. You're a Neanderthal.
Kids.
Just curious. That's a nasty cut you've got.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car. Nice and slow.
What for?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
I call the policia.
No police.
But, Senor--
No police! Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Hey! You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
What?
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
A lot that means.
You broke my nose!
Yeah...
Say, what happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Wait a second--
Would you?
Would I what?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
Next time you'll do just fine.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
I came for Grace.
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Two-hundred dollars?
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the juke?
What?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Darrell--
So?
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.
How much time?
Twenty-after-ten.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Two-hundred.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
Open up!
I want my car.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
That's none of your business. Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Superior? What for?
Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.
There. All done. Lift me down.
What?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have an idea.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
How do you know he's still not here?
Are there snakes out here?
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
You'd never understand.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
I'm sorry...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Darrell? You know he and Jake are...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace ... Grace?
The money's right here! Get the key!
Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
Good thinking. What's all this?
I can't see it.
Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
Anywhere?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
Why's that?
<u>Jake</u>...
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got.
Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
You got a beer?
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Heineken?
No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller.
Let me get your change.
Son of a bitch!
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Morning Grace.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Help me, Grace, help...
I axed you a question.
I want to stay.
Yes?
Is Noel in?
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.
Oh.
Wow.
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I'm listening.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
What does that mean?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
When was the last time I wore pink?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh shit...
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
Yes.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
...I think rust.
Rust?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What was that?
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
Why?
I don't know Megan.
You've never been sick?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
I assumed because of the train.
It's for last week's game.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Just give me a minute.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I thought he was carrying something.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Like what?
Yes.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I have to go now.
Quick.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's kind of a miracle.
Yeah?
When?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
I'm going to go in.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Why'd you do that?
Just one--
Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What things?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
How much did you take off?
How much is it?
What do you do if something happens?
How many did you put on that time?
All of it.
I'm sleeping in my room.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
I know now.
Know what?
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You're lying.
I'll just shoot him once.
You like sports?
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Yeah, hello.
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Is this a religious thing?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
...I got a present for you.
Why?
Well, go get it then.
Where is it?
She's gonna live. She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
I fined 'em instead.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
He said...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
He tell you where them others is?
Nope.
He give 'em names?
I thought... you was an angel.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Scouting?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you really going to kill them?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Free ones?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Oh. Yeah.
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Shit and fried eggs.
Books. He's my biographer.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hit your finger, huh?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her?
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Yup.
All week?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
The... Duck of Death.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Is... is it... loaded?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
Ned's share?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He's... he's dead.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Who killed him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
A sign on him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
I could of... easy.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
Jesus!
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
Been gone near three years now.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Three ways, I figured.
No.
You're goin' back with him?
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Well... I don't recollect.
Get some sleep, Kid.
Finish him, Ned.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Did you kill him?
Shit!
Better re-load it.
You missed him? You didn't...?
He ain't killed.
They takin' water?
When we gonna double back?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
It's gonna get riper yet.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Is it him?
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
Say, Bill...
That was... the first one.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
You... gonna take... the money?
You could have it. All of it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You ain't shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed. M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
You sure you ain't armed?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
I was lucky in the order. I always been lucky killin' folks.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
Three ways?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
He musta been movin' right along.
Sally?
She gave me the evil eye.
You ain't like that no more.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Yeah.
He hit you?
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Shit.
Jesus.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Yeah?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
You want the Spencer, Bill?
What is it, son?
Who's he?
Hullo, paw.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
Tom?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
The Kid, yeah...
Did you... did you... ?
Did I what?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
Who said that?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Nothin's bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Far enough.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
Yeah.
How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
Jesus. You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I don't kill nobody without him.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
An' if I spot 'em?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah?
Who ?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
They want more time to think about investing.
Goddamnit.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Come home, Dean.
I know who he is.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
You are a criminal.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
He's alright.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Why don't you just calm down'
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
Did you hear what he just said?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
County. I was in for fraud.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
What fence? Who?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You have to come.
Tough break.
You watch your mouth.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Three million?
Maybe more.
No killing?
We'll make it.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
What if I
How are you, Keaton?
Ready?
Let's say for example -
with what?
Who's your boss?
The answer is no.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.
We're on vacation.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Who is he?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Someplace else, then.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I'11 find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I know he was good.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
He loved her.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
You're stalling, Verbal.
Give a guy a break, huh?
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You're not safe on your own.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes. Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... he wants to testify ...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Yes.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I do. Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
... that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand ...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Dr. Thompson...?
That's what I'd planned to...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Negligent. Yes...it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Dr. Gruber ...
I read the hospital report on your client.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Thank you ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Alito, please.
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Laura.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time --?
What...?
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I...do you want me to leave?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe... Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
No...no...
Is it over?
No.
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
I...please. My wife...my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Hi, Mickey ...
Uh ...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
What?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
That's right.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
The 'History'...?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I'm sure you do ...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know. I went ...
... You saw her?
We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though...
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Thank you.
You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop... ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
I want you.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
Hello.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
What about?
You.
You're not far wrong.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you have dinner with me?
Why?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No.
No? Then what?
No.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Why?!
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You can.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Mmmm.
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
How does it work?
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I need you.
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
I don't know... Switzerland?
I made it.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
No...
Where were you?
Where had you been before?
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Wandering about.
When you... There were pins in my hair...
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
My name is John Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
-- talking to you...
Would you like some coffee?
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Do you know where you're going?
How old?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
I don't like them.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Where are you now?
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
Where were you born?
Long ago...
No!... No!
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Why did you jump?
No!
No, I can't tell you!
What?!
Take me away from here?
Home?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Vaguely...
What do you remember?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
How do you know?
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Why? What's happened?
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes --
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Yes?! But --
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Here with you.
And it's a all real.
My love... because I love you.
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
You can't.
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine --
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Let me go! Let me go!!
You believe that I love you?
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
What is her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Her car is gone.
Ow!!
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please! And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I had to quit, Midge.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Sorry, old man. Work.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
I think I can lick it.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
That!?!
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Johnny!
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
Just wander.
Where?
Around.
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What have you been doing?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
She died.
How?
By her own hand. There are many such stories.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
But you said grey, sir.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
How soon can it be altered?
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Jesus.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
How ya doing?
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
Why?
This is pathetic.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Stop it!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her fucking head was caved in.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
Sun rises at 5:52.
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
What?
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
They won't figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
There is no candy!
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Are you solid with that?
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Have you thought about what I said?
I got you.
My god.
Money?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
Where is she?
Okay. Hi.
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
Yup.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
That's right.
Is everything okay?
She's in there!
No I don't.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows she's here.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Regarding what?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
I don't know...
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That's right.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
Then what do they have?
There's my point exactly.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
Not really, no.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
You said nobody would miss her.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Ball park sausages.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go. Upsy daisy big guy.
May we have the rings please?
What?
This is ridiculous.
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
I think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Well it's bad timing.
How do you figure?
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He is.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Time out.
That's absurd.
I've seen it on television.
Do you love me?
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
We've got problems here.
Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?
I will.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I love you.
Hello.
Hi. Are you calling from jail?
Not yet.
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
We're not canceling.
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
No.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
But...
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
The only proof is those bodies.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
What?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
No...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
But...
You did all right dad.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just kills me...
Everything okay?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
That's just insecurity.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
I'm not breathing right.
I don't care for him.
He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
The first day.
Did she believe you?
I have no idea.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
A move?
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
Did he try to kiss you?
There.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
What song?
"You Send Me."
...embarrassing, shameful...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Good times.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
Which couch?
Take me there.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward ...
Come down here, you scamp.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
What do you mean?
Yes, it is.
Don't you ever see him?
Never.
How could anybody behave like that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
And this innocent child.
You must think I am a monster.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Let me pass!
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
But what can I say to her, sir?
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
What will the lady say?
She won't even know.
Is it all right?
Yes.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
And in the vegetable plot?
Me?
It's very good.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
My God, what have you done to him!
He was asking for it.
Ramona! Ramona!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
She's mad.
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
What are you thinking about?
She isn't my cousin.
How in hell does it wind up?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Me, rich? Come on!
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
And this chest?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Why?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What do you know about me?
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?
I'll be ready.
And ...your friend?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
It's for people!
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
What's he called?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
How are you today?
Are your parents alive?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Where?
Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way! You stay here.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I had so many things to think about!
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
When you are, miss.
Don't talk like that!
What about you, Manuel?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
What happened to me?
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.
What?
How did you see me?
From the terrace.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
In English, please.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
What about them?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
On my life, I promise you I will.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I think we both know who did. What's so urgent?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
What's the assignment?
Only because I got pulled out early.
Think you can do it?
Not from in here.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
What did you find out?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
HEY!!!
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
How do you kill it?
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
SID  NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't need a babysitter.
You all right?
You ready for this?
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
What are you doing?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Give me your wrist.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Don't get out of the car.
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Which way?
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
We know you didn't kill those guards.
You're not capable of it.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
See something?
Nice work.
Find out anything?
Can I ask you something?
You don't know?
You okay?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
You and me have nothing in common.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
There you go  best seat in the house.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Thank-you, Daryl. You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
...tonight...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him.
...on the way in.
When you... What? I'm busy.
It's the White House.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
It's <u>producing</u>.
Ames here. <u>Yessir</u>...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is: you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of...
I don't think you're gonna need it.
What can it hurt.
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant? Is she? Can I see her "chart?" Because...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir. "Calico."
...can we have a white one...?
...this is a snappy song....
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Izzat the thing...
...The Albanian Campaign...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...twelve years.
Yeeaahhh... Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
...and...
And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Look, look, look.... He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Come on.
...where?
...his Triumphal Plane. Shot Down.
...how do we Explain That? Hey? Am I worried...?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
What rig?
What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>. He's <u>dead</u>. The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
Who we got here...?
Three minutes. It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story?
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold.
What would do that...?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
What is it?
Twenty thousand dollars.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who would find out?
...the...
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>. Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
<u>Who</u>?
Yes.
Why?
What do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Precisely.
...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
In the yellow ribbon.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...can we see the Kitten...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes. We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
Tonight. Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
Why is this putz on the air...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
...take a long view.
...what's the Long View?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington... ...it's only Nine More Days.
Yes. That's true. But...
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Anything at the Airport?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think: S'it gonna rain...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
No rain.

Catching up on his reading. Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Knock on wood.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.

We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
...this is magnificent.
...Stanley Moss...
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
...fourteen years...
He just got Hip to us. He just ended the War.
What are we going to do?
Oh, God...
Oh, Lord....
War's over, Pal.
He thinks it's too...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days. ...s'there a problem?
No. No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Wilfred.
Give'em another pill...
No. No. He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison...
What about him?

Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
"...where's my pill..."
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT. SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes? Ties? Hats...? Good. Good.
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews.
Captain... You wanna Take'er up...?
Heavy weather East of here.
Whaddaya think?
Course there's a war. I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
What <u>are</u> you interested in?
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
...why?
...you the Press Office?
...Yes.
Earn your money. ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Where'd you go to school, Kid. Wellesly?
China.
When's he coming back...?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Trade Re1ations.
You're goddamn right. And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.
Do I know you?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss. Is to fight a holding action.
...holding action. THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh... You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business. Why come to me?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Here's the Short Course: Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Uh, it's a slogan. From, uh...
Remember the Maine...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!

Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.

I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
...well, see him?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
What the hell...
What's going on?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Hey the door was open.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Start unloading.
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
About what?
Don't start, alright.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
I don't know anything!
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
So you're hot on this stock?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Yeah, right...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...
So what firm you with, pal?
Jackson, Steinem...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
What? How do you know about my father?
Know the name?
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
What the hell do you want?
Why do you need to wreck this company?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello Bud.
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
What if I have a previous engagement?
So. See you Friday.
You really do believe in destiny?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Well, why stop at that?
I don't.
...isn't it perfect!
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
It's over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
With Mark?
Businessman?
Businessman!
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Yeah
But?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
What's that?
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
About what? About us.
A little what? CHINA See. You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark. It's ok. It's ok.
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right

Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared? Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
What? Tony and China, together?
Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know. I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No, no James, it's not like that. Tony and China, they're just friends.
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Oh that explains everything.
You don't understand. I recognized his face now come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Safety in numbers man.
Anyone else not coming?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton. This is Sir Wilfred.
No thank you sir we're fine.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Can this be stopped?
Mom.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
Servants. Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really? We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Stop saying things so loud!
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
That was very good.
Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
That's not true.
He loves you very much. He just--
I miss you.
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
Did you?
No. But once I heard...
What?
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Do you really think so?
Fireball?
These are good.
How do you know it's a she?
I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.
What does she look like?
Pretty. She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Are you humoring me?
What's happening to me?
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
She said, "You know." That I know.
Do you?
No.
Have you been hurt?
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
What?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Of course. You must be so proud.
I am.
How're you holding up?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Almost.
I'm sorry?
No. I'm just not sure what you mean.
There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned.
At the party.
Toward the end. You remember?
Who's that?
Yes?
Um...
Well maybe your wife...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
Who?
Give me that shit. Your wife.
Who are you?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I've seen you. From the window.
Hello?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Who? Your husband?
What? What are you afraid of?
Tell me. Please.
Tell me. I can help you.
How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
I've never even met you.
I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
I wanted to apologize.
And then you weren't there.
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
Thank you.
No.
Of what? What were you so afraid of?
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
Yeah.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
What's your name?
Claire.
Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
Why are you here?
Full scholarships. Princeton too. She wanted to stay close.
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
Wow.
This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
You should have heard her play.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
She's making this up.
She got it. Turned it down.
How you holding up?
Good. I'm good.
You are?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Oh my god. You bought it.
Yep.
Know what I think?
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
What?
In the window. Norman's at work.
Sit down here.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Mef? What's Mef?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
I think so
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
It's alright.
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
Something was there. You saw it.
Hartford?
But Claire--
Okay. Okay.
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
I'm a terrible friend.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
Like what?
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Did he say that?
I guess not.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
I think three...
What's their name?
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
If you have to work...
How are you?
Fine.
It's okay if you're not.
I am, really.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Not the focus.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job. She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
Tomorrow.
I'm finished at three. No. Squash with Stan.
After that.
Of what?
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
Honey, they're young. They're probably newlyweds.
I'm telling you. There was something in her voice...
Why?
That's not what I'm sug--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
Claire...
I know.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Mmnph.
Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something.
Hi.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
Claire?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean? Some noises where?
In the house. I was scared.
Did you call the police?
No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering.
What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week. I want you to feel safe.
Think I may have cracked it.
I think so. Maybe.
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Ohmigod. You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
What? No. No.
You didn't?
Sorry. You understand.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Get down! He'll see.
What's going on, Claire?
He killed her.
Our house.
It's a flare.
A flare?
Where is she then?
See?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did? Mrs. Feur?
Dressed?
Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.
Oh.
...since Caitlin. You don't remember this?
Tonight?
When you do this, I swear...
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
What are you doing?
Restaurant. Let them know we're running late.
You're not at the center.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...
I never said...
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and--
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
How did you--
What?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Sabotage?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
The accident...?
Keep your voice down.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine. I'm fine.
Do I have everything?
Yep.
What?
You know I am.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
You dropped a glass.
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I may have seen her on campus.
Not personally.
No. I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's her. This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife...
"You know..."
I was there.
It was last year. We were having troubles.
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
Who?
Leave her out of this!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
I tried to break it off!
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
We have to get out of here.
It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's gone.
What?
She can't be here without me.
Look for antiques...
Yep. There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.
What?
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
She's out there isn't she? She's in the lake.
Okay. Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
What?
:Would you stop it!
:Well, they are.
Then what is he...?

There is no one here but the dead.
Go away! I don't want you here.

A girl...?
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.

You went into the cells --- and you changed them. How...?!
No!
Put - him - down! His - his heart...
Let me go... Michaelllllll...
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this... LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
What do you see...?
Just one. The bar's closed.
The one time I want it to work...
Harder...
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...? LIKE THIS...?!
What else did you see- Michael...?
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Too much... too fast...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H. Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
All I meant was -
Seems more like a year than a month.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Michael! Jesus I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute. Rowan - what is going on...?
You know...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Hello..
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Did you see the old man on the ---
That's cause we're below sea level.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
You alright...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
A bit much. Lucas.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Dovetails. Gotta be a hundred years old.
Hi.
Hi. You - you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see a movie...?
I - I... I can't, Michael. There's stuff --- at the clinic -
I can't.
That's not good enough. Why not...?!
Michael - please - just. a little longer. Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Stop it!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Michael - I'm sorry... Just give me -
Lasher... Where --- where is ---
On which planet...?
You can't just -
Wow...
You okay...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...? This about Rowan...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville. Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
Sut McKinley. Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Hey - I love gloves- I look really great in gloves.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
OH MY GAWD!
I'm sorry - I didn't think
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?
My names isn't ANGELA...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Sugar?
So what do you do?
I'm a dentist
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...
I don't know...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
My mother...? I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What's wrong?
What is it?
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE? Is that good enough?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
What's wrong with you?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What?
I want you out now
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
What happened?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Just put it in my room
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Her husband left her
Dr STECKLER?
Yes...?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
ANGEL...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
See? Did you see that?
Were you always this sick?
That's crazy talk.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Cut it out, before you break something!
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
Check this out. Hurry!
Hurry.
What is it now?
Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Take a whiff of heaven.
You're late, bro!
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Get them together.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
Let me get this straight...
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first. I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
But that smile.
Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So that's a maybe?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Yeah? You like?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Christy? You want to be in "Heaven?"
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
Remember dress up day? You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Well?
You have changed since second grade.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Sweetheart, what is it?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We miss you. We miss our son.
I remember spring break of my senior year. Seems like a lifetime ago.
You guys are my parents.
Of course we are.
Son.
I guess.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Finally, some gratitude.
Sorry I--
It's okay. You need me?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
I know. I'm Ginger. Miss April.
The one with the horses.
That's me.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry. He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Hmmm?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Ted! Do something!
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Well?
You're on the next plane home.
You mean they knew who I was?
My legacy.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
James, what are you doing here?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My new bike.
Very funny.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
My room?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
It's not up to me.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
You want it in writing?
You're a peach.
He was my Grandfather, too.
I meant biologically.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Me-ow.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I have absolutely no intention--
But you triple-dog-dared me.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Your article sucked.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Well? What do you think of her?
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
Not "whatever." It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's all so complicated.
Eventually you'll let go.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
But you never do.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
I see.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
I want you to trust me.
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Yellow pages?
They're playing our song. Dare I ask for this dance?
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie? You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Well? Surprised?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Oh. Goodness.
You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help. I'm really in deep shit.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Rules are rules.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
You do like girls, don't you?
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I do?
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing... I've never even actually...
I told you you could do it.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
What are you doing?
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Bad news.
People pay good money for that?
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Kelly.
You look pretty.
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
Merritt, Forensics.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...
What about the blood?
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
About Suzie?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
And the child...
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
Take your time.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
Did you try to fight him?
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
No.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
You saw the news today?
Unless what?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins...
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home.
Where's Lombardo?
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.
So you were alone.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
What was that?
I want a full-scale investigation.
What about witnesses?
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
The teeth, were they...
You guess? Did he or didn't he?
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
What did you do then?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
This wasn't my idea.
Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
What?
A ride. You want one?
It's those rocks, up there.
I say something funny?
I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
Excuse me?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Kelly. What is it?
I miss Dad.
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
What?
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.
Where's the hose? We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly. Is Suzie there?
Hello?
Hello.
I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me.
And you believe her?
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you. Now give me the line.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
Good thinking.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Forget it.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I just want my life back...
Just like that?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Who is it?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
Davy.
I had to go look for this coupon.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But she ran away.
Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here.
Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Sam...
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?
What's wrong?
What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Hi, Sandy.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sandy... What's up?
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what?
J. S. Bach.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer.
Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists. Eight different fields of endeavor. Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Put them all together and what do we have?
You need that real often?
Always hoping. Or this...
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Aha?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.
Doyle, once around the park. I need a moment to prepare.
Prepare what?
That's a lot of butler.
Quite. Come, let's mingle.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
Now, what was that?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
What was all that back there?
All what?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
What way is that?
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
Thank you.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Know what this is?
Sure. It's a wind-up... thing.
This is good.
Oh, damn! That's it.
It's better than nothing.
It is?
What's this?
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Relax. We're almost there.
What is that?
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Not again.
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir. You should have the honor of going first.
Oh, thank you.
Artemus, you ready for this? His next target is Albuquerque.
What? President Grant is...!
I know! I know!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God! He's so excessive!
Pull the balloon right in front of him! We'll board the damn thing!
What is this? A whole new train?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Yes, me!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
Anyone?
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Would that include me?
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My. It's gotten longer.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
French?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that.
Good work. Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nicely said, sir.
And?
Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
He had a pressing engagement.
I've even printed my own currency.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they? What do they want with me?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Madmartigan! What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan. What did you do this time?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
Yes...?
You are the guardian, Willow. You must take her to Tir Asleen.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Why can't you do it? You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
Sir! I have to talk to you.
Not today, Willow.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You! Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool. Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Why.
Hey! Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
What's that? I hear something!
You hear trouble.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
You!!
Hey! Give me that baby!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
You?
I'll help you...!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
You?
Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Watch it!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Who are you! Who are you!
Kill him!
No!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
No.
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
Willow. To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What do I need for that?
I'm all finished. Now what?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left! Go on! Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will! Your will! What else could it be?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
What'd you bit me for!!
Again: what is the magician's weapon?
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
How??
Get down! The ritual chant! Quick! Protect yourself!
Why?
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
Elves! They're always tormenting babies. They make them cry and take their tears.
Watch this. Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Who??
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
This is not going well.
Talk! Say something!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Obviously.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, why?...
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.
What are you going to do?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
You know who?
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
Johnny 
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
It's all over, Paul.
Where are you taking us?
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Whacking?
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
Home.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I can't.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
No, no doctor...
But why?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
How long have I been here?
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes.
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
The... bullets?
Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
You know carpentry?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Sure.
But... You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?
You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?
I didn't even know about it.
Johnny, what the fuck?
I hear you.
It's me.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Say again?
You know where he is.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Did you find him?
I don't know where he is.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Good morning.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
What's so funny?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
No...
That has no place in this house.
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
He's not in this building.
He'll live.
You might have killed him!
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Aunt Em!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!
Dorothy. Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
If she...
If she?
If any!
From now on you'll be history
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
I don't believe you!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so. I'm a humbug!
Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Oh --
Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Hickory!
Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
...didn't you?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Ahh! Ah!
Run, Toto, run!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
...Toto, too?
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Yes --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh --
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh-huh.
...room --
...bed.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
But -- what's this? I thought you were going along with me.
Oh --
Now you're seeing reason.
No --
Here! I've got an order! Let me have...
Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
We might.
And bears!
What sort of an animal is that?
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No. Why only -- Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks! Listen!
...yes.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Who's her? Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Does it work?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh! Toto -- Toto!
Did they hurtcha?
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
...don't talk.
Down? No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --

Did I scare you?
They would?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.
Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin!
What?
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...along.
It does help. Dorothy, you're waking up!
Yes -- there --
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh --
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody --
No -- No -- No -- No!
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
...ting the ruby slippers?
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah.
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Who at?
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here -- Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine. He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
It's a whatzis.
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
No? Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
You don't get around us that easy!
Mr. Gale!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
... about Dorothy.
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
...Tin Man!
Quiet!
...of the West.
Beautiful! What an echo!
No, sir!
That's right.
We do.
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh! Oh, come on, come on!
Look -- you can see it here. It's wonderful!
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Oh -- now look at him! This is terrible!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! HELP!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh - look out.
It's a whozis.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
No, you don't.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
What about us?
Well, I --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well, I --
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
But I still want one.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
So who are you?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
The plutonium is missing. Theyve taken the core!
Then its no longer a bomb?
Whos she?
Elektra King.
Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
Hes sealed himself in.
Do you know what youre doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
But what if...
Weve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Its just a scratch.
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
Constructions not exactly my line.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
I took the initiative.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Its a message. He wants us to know hes back.
Who?
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
The inside man?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
The name?
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
In case youve forgotten. Im dead already.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
He was my father.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Yes.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Oh my God...were buried alive...
I cant stay here.
No! It will cave in!
I cant stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
What is it?
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What are you talking about?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, its over.
I dont know what youre talking about!
I could have given you the world.
Wheres M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
You turned Renard.
So you killed your father.
Was this all about the oil?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
See? Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where did you get this?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Shes no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?
Wheres the sub going?!
No! Get me out!
So. My way. No MI-6, no Interpol. Just you, me and my people.
Where?
The Maidens Tower.
No! Bond!
What class sub does your nephew run?
Ill send someone out.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Someone will come.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? Its what you wanted.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
Everythings under control up here. Are you ready?
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
The parcels in the post.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why? What's the problem?
I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent.
The access code's been changed. Your card won't work anymore.
What?!
Had a lot of blood in him.
You oughta see upstairs. It's a slaughterhouse.
Washington?
Walter --
Don't call me that.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
A whore fucking.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
Oh? The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I'm here, Laurie.
Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
I'm not here. I'm still on Mars. I've come to collect you.
The atmosphere. I'm sorry. These things slip my mind.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon -- there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Oh God. I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I won't do that.
What -- am I --
Its very strange. Times flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- what??
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
Space and time. I finally understand, Laurie. I see it all now.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
No. I just wanted you to --
You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
What??
It is Jon. Twenty-four years ago. Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
And what if youre wrong?
Im not.
Damn straight.
Damn straight! We were heroes.
His what?
His . . . whatever.
No wonder Adrian's rich. You use that stuff?
Old?
Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
-- What is it.
Laurie --
I'm an open target, Dan. If you're with me --
Enough is enough, Daniel. Where exactly are we?
The Owlship. I can't believe it.
God, you sound like Jon. -- Turn around.
What are you up to?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan. You're aiming high!
I don't want to take 'em out. Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No way. I'm not that much of a pervert.
What's he doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ? Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself. He changed the past.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars. What year is this??
Dan -- what do we do now?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left. Backs together --
Hiya, pardner. Long time no see.
Sure. You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
So do I. So do you.
. . . That was quick.
What new information?
CTU. Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Where's Laurie?
Coward. Giving up.
What caused it?
Adrian. What are you doing? Why wouldn't you let us in?
He's the one. He's been the one all along. Stalking us.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Anything for science, I guess. Janey, there's something --
We should get back -- What?
Nothing. What were you going to say?
Stupid watch. Stopped again. Do you have the --
I can fix it.
-- What?
No. No. Cut. -- Justine, we agreed. No questions about the Watchmen.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No comment.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not. Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk. Pack your things.
Am I free to go?
Adrian.
Don't rub it in. I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian! Don't leave so soon. I --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
What about you?
Maybe I'll do that.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Terrorist. Radical agitator. Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff. I got nothing to do with --
Worked both sides of the fence. Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
CTU? Jesus. You don't think --
New information.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone. Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.
Who the hell are you?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Up yours.
Is that all?
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Thanks.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Yes it does.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Whatchu doing here?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What do you get if you finish?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Like what?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Where are you going?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Who are you?
What are you?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
They tell me you're an American agent.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
Are you alright?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Where are we going?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
We'll have to go after them.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Did you do your homework?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Where's he headed?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
What are you doing?
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
The Peace conference...
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
This is your standard dart gun.
I'm through, Xander.
What...?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're serious?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Sit down.
Nice hops.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
That's the guy.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
What's this?
What's going on, my friend?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
That was for Anders.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
I wish I could go.
Scott.. I -
I don't like him being here.
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
Hey. I'm sorry. About Logan. I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Into the Hudson?
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
You know, you --
I'm o.k. I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars. Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Yeah? Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Were you now?
What do you say?
Let go.
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What is it you intend to do to me?
I do love a good check mate.
What do you want?
Where am I?
What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
How?
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
I lost him.
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece. Only a piece.
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir. It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Carlson!
Yes, sir?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What in God's name are you doing?
Baack!
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmmmm.
MMMmm!
Is it that music?
MMMMM! MMMMM!
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Will you miss me?
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
You're incorrigible!
Does that mean you love me?
I will! Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Surprised?
Surprised!
Love me?
Ready, darling?
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not. I just meant...
I suppose you're right.
That's a tough choice.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Good night.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes!... the laboratory.
No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
Well... we'll see.
Will there be anything else?
I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
How long will this whole thing take?
Why did you do that?
What?
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
A piece of what?
Vermicelli.
How old are you, young man?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
There.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf! There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
Suit yourself...I'm easy. Better watch out for the wockers.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Home!
Down! Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
Fro-derick!
What are you doing here?
But what you were doing?
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
It seems that way. You didn't hear any music at all?
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What is this place?
It is! This was my grandfather's private library. Look at this!
Taking the book along?
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Hmm!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
That's not bad.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Oh! May I call you 'Master'?
Why?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like -- just hurry!
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Tonight?
Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough. More! More, do you hear me?
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Cold! Cold and dead!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps.
Original.
Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
You can say that again.
Yes.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no! That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
What did you find out?
Where is he?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Can you play it?
Thanks...for all your help.
I'm a failure.
What monster?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What???
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
Is everything ready?
Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's the only way.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
May I see your violin?
It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
Nice! Nice little balance to it.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Are you busy?
Would you like a sandwich?
No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.
Inga!
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga, wake up!
What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen! Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes! What could it be at this hour?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
Yes!
Right here?
Raise the platform, hurry!
Reputation. Reputation!
I thought it was wonderful.
Oh, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.
What are you going to do?
Do you think you can sing it?
Me? Sing?
I'd be so nervous.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
All right -- give it to him!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
I think so.
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
What?
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
His what??
His schwanzstucker.
It's working! Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
I'm getting tired.
Look how far we've come.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
How long is it so far?
Four
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
Drink!
